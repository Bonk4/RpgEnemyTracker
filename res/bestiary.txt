Benaioh	0.00	1200	Large	-1	18, touch 8, flat-footed 18	52	1	0	-3	clay shell	15		20 ft.	2 slams +12 (1d8+9)		10 ft.	10 ft.	disease, spray slime	Str 28, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 2, Cha 1	4	14	23	AP 93	Clay Shell (Ex) A benaioh is safely encased in an animated clay shell that is sculpted to resemble a giant humanoid. The shell provides the inhabiting ooze total cover. When the clay form is destroyed, it shatters violently, exploding in a spray of jagged clay shards that deal 3d6 points of damage to all creatures in a 30-foot-diameter burst centered on the benaioh. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves this damage. This explosion releases the benaioh from its clay shell; thereafter it uses its ooze form statistics (see below). The save DC is Strength-based.  Disease (Ex) While a benaioh is immune to disease, it carries a contagion with which it both infects other creatures and propagates itself. Any creature struck by the benaioh's spray slime ability is exposed to this disease.  Wormrot: Contact; save Fort DC 20; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect sickened plus 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature that dies of wormrot transforms into a benaioh over the course of the next 24 hours.  Spray Slime (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds (but no more than 6 times per day), a benaioh in its clay shell can force a stream of itself in a 20-foot line of worm-laden slime from one of the clay shell's orifices. The putrescent sludge deals 3d6 points of acid damage and exposes the target to wormrot.  Symbiotic Senses (Ex) A benaioh can still use its blindsense and tremorsense abilities while housed inside its animated clay shell.

A creature within or entering the area must succeed on a DC 10 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. One round later a second Fortitude save must be made (whether the first one succeeded or not) or the affected creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based .A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature, but does not remove the blindness. Creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the sickened effect but can still be blinded if they fail their save, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on both saving throws. The stench is highly potent, and short of magical means of cleaning, all cloth and such material continue to reek for 1d6 months. The odor is so strong that it doubles all chances for random encounters and imposes a -6 penalty on Stealth checks attempted while wearing clothing contaminated with a skunk's musk. Flesh, leather goods, metal goods (weapons, armor, and the like) must be washed in a concentrated mixture of vinegar over period of 1d3 days .  Otherwise, the stench clings for at least one week, imposing the same modifiers to random encounters and Stealth checks.

Individual larvae may be squeezed or cut out of the host with a DC 10 Heal check, though each attempt inflicts 1d4 points of damage whether or not it's successful. A cure disease spell destroys all larvae without further harm to the host.

This functions in a similar fashion to a detect evil spell but there is no chance the wizard's shackle is stunned and it is not blocked by stone, lead, or other material. Attach (Ex) If a wizard's shackle hits with a bite attack, it latches onto the opponent's body. An attached wizard's shackle is effectively grappling its prey. The wizard's shackle loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 14, but holds on with great tenacity. Wizard's shackles have a +20 racial bonus on grapple checks (already figured into the CMB and CMD entries above). An attached wizard's shackle can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To remove an attached wizard's shackle through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the wizard's shackle. Spell Drain (Su) A wizard's shackle drains spells when attached to an arcane spellcaster. Each round the wizard's shackle remains attached, it drains 1d6 levels of prepared spells or unused slots, beginning with the highest level spell or slot available. For example, on a roll of 4 against a 5th-level wizard, a wizard's shackle drains four levels of prepared spells. The wizard currently has one 3rd-level spell, two 2nd-level spells, and three 1st-level spells prepared. The wizard's shackle drains the 3rd-level spell and one of the 1st-level spells (determined randomly). A creature drained of spells or slots can attempt a DC 12 Intelligence check with a +2 bonus to notice that something is wrong (though unless he searches his body, he might still overlook the wizard's shackle). Once a wizard's shackle has drained at least 4 spell levels, it detaches and crawls away to digest its meal. Lost spells or slots can be regained normally.

Str 4, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	0	-3	4 (8 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Implant (Ex) As a full-round action, an alpluachra can crawl into the mouth of a helpless creature (no more than three size categories larger than itself) and implant itself into the creature's throat. Once implanted, anything that the creature ingests is instead consumed by the alpluachra, including such substances as elixirs and potions or ingested alchemical items, diseases, drugs, or poisons. Once the alpluachra is implanted, the host creature begins suffering the effects of starvation and thirst (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444). Due in part to its numbing slime, an implanted alpluachra is difficult to detect. Each time the host creature ingests anything, it gains an automatic Perception check against the alpluachra's Stealth. After the newtlike fey is detected, it can be removed either by consuming at least half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water, by a remove disease spell cast on the host creature, or by treating the host with a successful DC 15 Heal check. When a Heal check made for this purpose fails by 5 or more, the host creature takes 1d6 points of damage. If the host attempts to remove the alpluachra by eating salt or drinking salt water, it must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d8 hours from the reaction with the alpluachra. If the alpluachra dies or becomes unconscious, it is immediately detected by the host creature, and can be removed safely as a full-round action. While implanted, an alpluachra is considered helpless.  Numbing Slime (Ex) Any creature that deals damage to an alpluachra with a natural attack or an unarmed strike, comes into contact with an alpluachra, or is host to an alpluachra must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or take a -4 penalty on all tactile Perception checks, as well as other skill checks requiring tactile senses (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand) for 24 hours. A host creature that fails this saving throw takes the penalty to detect the alpluachra implanted inside it. If the host creature succeeds at the saving throw, it can't be affected by the same alpluachra's numbing slime for another 24 hours.  Vulnerable to Salt (Ex) Half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water poured over an alpluachra or consumed by a creature an alpluachra has implanted itself in deals 1d3 points of damage to the alpluachra.

If it fails, the robot explodes, dealing 2d4 points of plasma damage to all targets in a 10-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 10 half). Half the damage dealt by plasma is fire damage, and half is electricity damage. This destroys the robot if it was still animate. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Fragile (Ex) When badly damaged, arachnid robots function poorly. An arachnid robot reduced to fewer than half its maximum hit points is staggered and moves at half speed. Further damage may cause the robot to explode.  Plasma Torch (Ex) An arachnid robot can use its arm-mounted plasma torch in two ways. First, it can use the torch to make a ranged touch attack against a target within 15 feet, dealing 1d6 points of plasma damage on a successful hit. Alternatively, the robot can emit a 15-foot cone from its torch, dealing 1d4 points of plasma damage to all targets in the area of effect (Reflex DC 10 half). The robot's plasma torch requires 1 full round to recharge between uses. Half the damage dealt by plasma is fire damage, and half is electricity damage.

If the spines hit, they can curse the target as well.  Stability (Ex) All giant urchins and similar creatures-like black spots-receive a +8 bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt.

A successful attack deals 1d4 points of acid damage and forces the target to make a DC 11 Fortitude saving throw to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Jabber (Su) A chon chon endlessly mutters half-remembered spells and meaningless arcane formulae to itself. This jabbering creates a kind of magical static that interferes with spells being cast nearby. Any creature attempting to cast a spell within 15 feet of a chon chon must make a successful DC 11 concentration check or lose the spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect.

Str 6, Dex 17, Con -, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 10	1	2	10	Tome of Horrors Complete	Animal Appearance (Ex) Clockwork scouts are constructed to resemble small animals such as badgers, dogs, or cats.  Often, their inner wood and metal workings are covered by an animal's pelt, while their frame is specially constructed to help reinforce the illusion that they are an animal.

The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound per Hit Die it possesses. Starting and stopping playback of recorded sound is a swift action. Removing a gemstone or installing a gemstone into a clockwork spy requires a DC 25 Disable Device check as a full-round action-failure does not damage the gemstone but does erase any recorded sounds on the gemstone. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they must be given simple commands as to when they are to start recording sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between creature types and subtypes, but not between specific individuals-a spy can be ordered to start recording sound as soon as a humanoid (human) or an aberration comes in range, but it cannot be ordered to start recording when a specific person comes within range. Once a clockwork spy begins recording sound, it cannot cease recording early. Likewise, it cannot record  sound onto a gemstone that already contains a recording.  Self-Destruct (Su) Unless specifically programmed otherwise by its creator, a clockwork spy explodes 1 round after it is destroyed. During this round, the thing shrieks and thrashes about as if undergoing convulsions. On what would normally have been the clockwork spy's next action, it explodes, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage in a 5-foot radius (Reflex DC 10 half ). A DC 20 Disable Device check made as a standard action can halt the spy's self-destruct sequence, but does not prevent it from dying. A clockwork spy that self-destructs automatically destroys its gemstone, along with any information contained inside it. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Any time a haniver succeeds at a Sleight of Hand check against a creature, it also rearranges that creature's possessions. The next time that creature attempts to produce a weapon or item, it finds its possessions misplaced or disarranged; retrieving a stored item or drawing a weapon then requires a standard action instead of a move action (unless the haniver has stolen the item in question). After spending this standard action, the character takes mental inventory and is no longer affected by this ability. Occasionally, hanivers replace items they've stolen or leave their old treasures-seashells, old fish, clumps of sand-in containers or clothing they have rooted through. They do this without any added difficultly to their Sleight of Hand checks.

Str 10, Dex 12, Con 16, Int 13, Wis 8, Cha 17	0	0	11	AP 84	Immortal (Ex) Shabti do not age naturally and cannot die of old age. While some might come into being at age categories other than adulthood, they never leave their original age category. Spells and effects that cause aging affect a shabti as normal.  Immune to Undeath (Ex) Shabti can't become undead. Spells and abilities that would transform a shabti into an undead creature have no effect.  Past-Life Knowledge (Ex) Shabti remember bits of their past lives. As a result, they treat all Knowledge skills as class skills.  Resist Level Drain (Ex) A shabti takes no penalties from energy drain effects, though he can still be killed if he accrues more negative levels than he has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels a shabti takes are automatically removed without the need for an additional saving throw.  Shattered Soul (Ex) Shabti who are killed are exceptionally difficult to return to life. Those who attempt to return a shabti to life using raise dead, resurrection, or similar spells must succeed at a caster level check equal to 10 + the shabti's Hit Dice. If this check fails, the spell fails and the caster can't return the shabti to life for the next 24 hours (though the caster can try again after this period).

The save DC is Charisma-based. Incorporeal Form (Su) A shadow rat can, as a standard action, assume an incorporeal form for up to 1 hour per day. In this form, the shadow rat loses its natural AC bonus but gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC. While in this form, the shadow rat is AC 16 (+2 deflection, +2 Dex, +2 size), touch 15, flat-footed 13. The shadow rat can still attack corporeal opponents while in its incorporeal form, but its attack only inflicts Strength damage and cannot cause physical damage. The shadow rat gains the incorporeal subtype while using this ability. Shadow Blend (Ex) A shadow rat can disappear into the shadows as a move action, gaining total concealment in all levels of illumination save bright light. Strength Damage (Su) A shadow rat deals Strength damage to living foes it bites. A creature reduced to 0 Strength cannot move but does not die-at least, not until the shadow rat's physical damage takes its toll.

An entangled opponent suffers tentacle damage and the effect of its poison each round the hold is maintained. An entangled creature still receives a save to avoid the effects of its poison. While a foe is entangled, the sea wasp cannot attack any other creature. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; the effects of the poison are determined by the creature's size (see table below).

It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting. Transparent (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp is nearly invisible floating in the water.

Small Obsidian Quasi-elemental	0.50	200	Small	-1	16, touch 10, flat-footed 16	5	0	1	2				20 ft.	claw +4 (1d4+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	death throes, molten glass (1d4 fire, DC 10)	Str 14, Dex 8, Con 11, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	1	2	11	Tome of Horrors Complete	Death Throes (Ex) When reduced to 0 or less hit points, an obsidian quasi-elemental explodes in a cloud of razor-sharp bits of obsidian. A creature caught in the area can make a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics for each elemental's death throes. Molten Glass (Ex) A successful hit against an obsidian quasi-elemental with a piercing or slashing weapon (or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage equal to its current HD opens a wound that spurts molten glass. The wound bleeds for 1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a Reflex save or take fire damage from the splash. A new save must be made each round the wound bleeds and a creature is within the area. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.

Living creatures within range take damage (damage is detailed with each elemental) each round they remain in the area. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. This effect is especially devastating to plants, animals, and aquatic creatures, which take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Earth Mastery (Ex) A salt elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)  Salt Poisoning (Ex) Anyone hit by a salt elemental's claw attack is sickened for 3 rounds + 1 round per Hit Dice of the salt elemental. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A salt elemental submerged in water that covers at least half its body takes 1d6 points of damage each round until it escapes. Damage from water-based attacks (such as the slam attack of a water elemental) deal +50% damage to a salt elemental.

An attached stirge is effectively grappling its prey. The stirge loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 12, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A stirge has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the stirge is removed.  Blood Drain (Ex) A stirge drains blood at the end of its turn if it is attached to a foe, inflicting 1 point of Constitution damage. Once a stirge has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and flies off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the stirge's appetite has been sated, the stirge detaches and seeks a new target.  Diseased (Ex) Due to the stagnant swamps in which they live and their contact with the blood of numerous creatures, stirges are harbingers of disease. Any creature subjected to a stirge's blood drain attack has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, the victim can no longer be infected by this particular stirge, though attacks by different stirges are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses.

Every round the xtabay uses this ability, the affected creature must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d2 Con damage. This feeding is curiously painless, and normally isn't enough to waken a foe put to sleep by the plant. Each round this feeding continues, the sleeping victim can attempt a new DC 14 Will save to awaken. This save DC is Constitution-based.  Soporific Pollen (Ex) As a standard action, a xtabay can release sleep-inducing pollen into the air around it. Each creature within a 10-ft.-radius burst centered on the xtabay must make a DC 14 Will save or fall asleep for 1d3 minutes. A creature that succeeds on the Fortitude save cannot be affected by the same xtabay's soporific pollen for 24 hours. A creature put to sleep by this pollen can be awakened by vigorously shaking the sleeper (a standard action) or by damaging it. This is a mind-affecting sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Known for their potent-and ultimately deadly-scent, xtabays are a f loral hazard to the unwary. As fast-spreading as ivy, a xtabay's vines are sturdy and adaptive, making the plant a potential threat nearly everywhere-from gardens to wells to forest groves.

It is immune to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks.  Dissolve Flesh (Ex) Though too dilute to cause damage in combat, a zhen worm's acidic mucus reduces a Mediumsized corpse to bones and a pool of foul-smelling slurry in 1d4 days. Each size category above Medium doubles the amount of time required, and each size category smaller than Medium halves it.  Protective Mucus (Ex) Weapons slip off the slick slime that coats a zhen worm, and fire has difficulty burning it away.  Zhen worms take half damage from weapons and fire. This ability does not reduce damage from confirmed critical hits.

This acid often remains in their mouths and is transferred to a victim bitten by a larva. Any melee bite attack deals acid damage.  Maggot Spray (Ex): Once per day, an abyssal larva can regurgitate and fire a stream of maggots at a single opponent within 10 feet. This requires the abyssal larva to succeed on a ranged touch attack. If the attack succeeds, the opponent is sickened for 1d2 rounds. A successful DC 10 Reflex save reduces the sickened condition to 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.  Tortured Mind (Ex): The mind of an abyssal larva is a warped and tangled mass of chaos. As a result, abyssal larvae are immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). A creature attempting to contact an abyssal larva with a mind-affecting spell or effect (including psionics) must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be affected as by a confusion spell for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.																												
Akata	1.00	400	Medium	6	13, touch 12, flat-footed 11	15	3	2	4	no breath		deaf, vulnerable to salt water	40 ft., climb 20 ft.	bite +2 (1d6+1 plus void bite), 2 tentacles -3 (1d3)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 12, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 3, Wis 12, Cha 11	1	2	14 (18 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Deaf (Ex) Akatas cannot hear. They are immune to spells and effects that rely on hearing to function, but they also cannot make Perception checks to listen.  Hibernation (Ex) Akatas can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time when food is scarce. When an akata wishes to enter hibernation, it seeks out a den and surrounds itself in a layer of fibrous material excreted from its mouth-these fibers quickly harden into a dense, almost metallic cocoon. While hibernating, an akata does not need to drink or eat. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 60 hit points, and is immune to fire and bludgeoning (including falling) damage. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the akata within remains unharmed. The akata remains in a state of hibernation until it senses another living creature within 10 feet or is exposed to extreme heat, at which point it claws its way to freedom in 1d4 minutes as its cocoon degrades to fragments of strange metal.  Salt Water Vulnerability (Ex) Salt water acts as an extremely strong acid to akatas. A splash of salt water deals 1d6 points of damage to an akata, and full immersion in salt water deals 4d6 points of damage per round.  Void Bite (Ex) Akatas hold hundreds of invisibly small larval young within their mouths, spreading these parasitic creatures to hosts through their bite. Only humanoids make suitable hosts for akata young-all other creature types are immune to this parasitic infection. The disease itself is known as void death.  Disease (Ex) Void Death: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 1 hour; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Dex and 1d2 Con damage; an infected creature who dies rises as a void zombie 2d4 hours later (see below); cure 2 consecutive saves.

The duration of any beneficial hexes longer than 1 round that affect an almiraj is increased by 50%.  Magic Horn (Su) While on the creature's head, an almiraj's horn is treated as a +1 weapon. Any living creature slain by an almiraj's gore attack immediately turns to stone (as if by the flesh to stone spell, with no saving throw, and the creature is still dead). A severed almiraj horn retains a wisp of its former magic, and counts as a masterwork weapon if used to create a magical dagger or similar small piercing weapon.

After 1 week, the host takes 1 point each of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain per day. When one of the three abilities reaches 0, the host dies. Infuse (Ex) A victim that has ingested an amber ooze must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or the amber ooze infuses itself into his body. The ooze merges with flesh and bone, and can only be removed by a remove disease spell. The save DC is Constitution-based. A detect magic (or similar magic) cast on the host reveals the amber ooze. If the victim succeeds on the Fortitude save, the amber ooze takes 1 point of acid damage per round from the host's digestive juices. Once it begins to take damage, the ooze retreats from the host's body through its mouth. Weaken Will (Su) An amber ooze that has infused itself into a host weakens the will of its victim. As long as the amber ooze remains in the host, he takes a -4 penalty on Will saves to resist mind-influencing spells and effects (such as charm person and suggestion.)

The tongue can be removed by making an opposed Strength check as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of slashing damage to the tongue (AC 11, damage does not deplete the bogwiggle's actual hit points). The bogwiggle cannot move more than 10 feet away from the target, but can release its tongue's grip as a free action. Unlike a giant frog, a bogwiggle cannot pull targets toward it with its tongue.  Swamp Stride (Ex) A bogwiggle can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a bogwiggle normally.

Carbuncle	1.00	400	Tiny	-2	12, touch 10, flat-footed 12	13	4	1	6			vulnerability to suggestion	20 ft.	bite +1 (1d3-3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	fatal faker, specious suggestion	Str 5, Dex 7, Con 12, Int 6, Wis 13, Cha 10	2	-3	9 (+13 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Empath (Su) Carbuncles possess a crude form of telepathy, allowing them to transmit mild impressions and remembered sensations to other creatures. This form of telepathy cannot convey language or hinder a target in any way (such as by transmitting pain). Thus, a carbuncle can relate a feeling of fear or the faint smell of leaves, but cannot directly warn an ally of a monster or tell of a treasure under a dirt mound.  Fatal Faker (Su) As a standard action three times per day, a carbuncle can teleport as per the spell dimension door, but only within a range of 30 feet. Upon teleporting, the carbuncle leaves behind a perfect replica of itself amid a colored flash and the sound of a reptilian choke. This replica duplicates the carbuncle in all ways, though it is obviously dead and the colorless stone in its head is reduced to worthless dust.  Specious Suggestion (Su) As a standard action three times per day, a carbuncle can concentrate intently on one creature within its line of sight and attempt to impose its will upon the target. A DC 11 Will save is enough to resist this compulsion. If the target fails to resist, roll 1d6. On a result of 1-2, the target gains a flash of insight and a +2 insight bonus to its Armor Class for 1 minute. On a result of 3-4, the victim is affected as if by suggestion for 1 minute, and must follow a single (usually embarrassing, always harmless) suggestion from the carbuncle. On a result of 5-6, the victim's thoughts are garbled with those of the carbuncle, imposing a -2 penalty to the victim's Will saving throws for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Vulnerability to Suggestion (Ex) Any mind-affecting spell can affect a carbuncle regardless of creature type limitations. A spell like charm person, for example, which typically only affects humanoid creatures, can also affect carbuncles.

If attacked first by such a creature, the carrionstorm's swarm attack deals only 1d3 points of damage to that creature rather than the usual 1d6 points.

If the skull strikes its target, she must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw to prevent it from ripping her soul from her body. If the victim fails the saving throw, the skull temporarily devours her soul, leaving her vulnerable to the commands of whoever holds the skull. Thereafter, the skull's possessor can use it to command the victim, as the dominate person spell. The soul remains stolen until the possessor chooses to release the victim or the skull is destroyed. While a chaneque can carry multiple skulls on its belt, it can only manipulate single soul at one time. The save DC is Wisdom-based.

Those at full hit points cannot be detected by the blood scent ability. Distraction (Ex) A clawbat's lengthy tongue whips around its body as it feeds, lapping up the blood from wounded creatures nearby. Every round a clawbat may choose either a creature it attacks or any creature it passes adjacent to as it moves. If the target is at less than full hit points, it must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The curse delivered by this bite persists for 1d6 hours, and cannot affect the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period. Affected creatures begin drying out when exposed to air, but can hold their breath for double the normal amount of time. Targets of this cursed bite take 1d6 points of damage for every 10 minutes they are out of water, though spending a full-round action to bathe the victim in any sort of water halts this damage. Victims must succeed at a DC 12 Constitution check to avoid this effect. Remove curse ends this curse's effect as normal. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Moisture Dependency (Ex) A coral capuchin can breathe both air and water and survive indefinitely on land, but the creature must regularly be either submerged in water or thoroughly wetted down, or else it dries out in the air. A coral capuchin can survive out of water for a number of hours of equal to its Constitution score before it takes any negative effects. After this time, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage for every hour it remains dry. Bathing the creature in water of any sort resets this time frame.

A dark dancer can use bardic performance as a 2nd-level bard, but only for distraction and inspire courage effects.  Dark Curse (Su) As a standard action, a dark dancer can make a touch attack against a foe and curse it. The foe must succeed at a DC 12 Will saving throw to resist the effects. Creatures that fail the saving throw take a -2 penalty on all Dexterity and Charisma-based skill checks. This curse is permanent, but the victim of this curse can attempt a new saving throw each day.  Death Throes (Su) When a dark dancer is slain, its body combusts in a flash of bright white light, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures within a 10-foot burst must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1d6 rounds. Other dark folk within 20 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Shadow Blend (Ex) A shadow rat can disappear into the shadows as a move action, gaining total concealment in all levels of illumination save bright light. Strength Damage (Su) A shadow rat deals Strength damage to living foes it bites. A creature reduced to 0 Strength cannot move but does not die-at least, not until the shadow rat's physical damage takes its toll.

Melee weapons do not endanger a user in this way. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a dragonfish. A creature that takes more than 2 points of damage from a dragonfish's barb has its speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts until the barb is removed, requiring a DC 15 Heal check at least 1 point of magical healing.

Deaf (Ex) An edon is deaf and automatically fails any Perception check based on sound. It is immune to any effect that requires the target be able to hear.  Stench Aura (Ex) An edon's stench aura affects only humans and halflings, and creatures with the scent special ability. All other creatures are immune to its effects. An edon can suppress its stench for 1d2 hours by rubbing juniper berries on its body. Doing so negates the aura for the duration.

This trip does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  Diseased Pustules (Ex) When a festrog takes damage from a piercing or slashing weapon, some of its boils rupture, squirting the attacker with puslike fluids. The noxious secretions carry a potent contact disease that causes those infected to break out into painful necrotic boils.  Necrotic Boils: Disease-contact; save Fort DC 11; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con; cure 1 save.

Envy: An envy fleshdreg's bite attack can temporarily interfere with magic. If an envy fleshdreg deals damage with its bite attack to any creature under a magic effect, the fleshdreg attempts a dispel check as if it were caster level 3rd against the spell effect with the highest caster level. If the dispel check is successful, the effect is suppressed for 1d4 rounds. Gluttony: A gluttony fleshdreg's bite attack can wither and weaken the body of the creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a gluttony fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Subsequent uses of this ability do not cause a bitten creature to become exhausted. Greed: A greed fleshdreg's bite can twist and warp the body of a creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a greed fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or have its speed reduced by half and take a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity for 1d6 rounds. Lust: A lust fleshdreg's bite can addle the mind of the creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a lust fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or become confused for 1 round. Pride: A pride fleshdreg's bite floods the senses of the creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a pride fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be blinded for 1 round and dazzled for the next 1d4 rounds. Sloth: A sloth fleshdreg's bite conjures an amber crust that covers the target and restricts the target's movements.

Wrath: A wrath fleshdreg's bite delivers energy damage to creatures it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a wrath fleshdreg's bite attack takes an additional 1d4 points of energy damage (fleshdreg's choice).  Sin-Scent (Su) Fleshdregs have scent against creatures whose nature reflects the fleshdreg's related sin. For example, a wrathful fleshdreg can scent creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular fleshdreg can scent.

The target can end the acid's effects by submerging the wound in water for a round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature that grapples or swallows the flumph takes this acid damage automatically every round it maintains this contact with a living flumph.  Stench Spray (Ex) A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foul-smelling liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability, except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet. To use this version of its stench spray, the flumph must succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most flumphs). If the target is hit, it must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 5 rounds. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can smell it at double this range).

This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability, except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds.  The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet - if the target fails its saving throw, it is nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 1 minute. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can smell it at double this range).

The resin grants a frost fir a +2 circumstance bonus on all disarm, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers, as well as on saving throws against effects that cause it to drop something it is holding. Any creature that is damaged by a frost fir's slam attack, deals damage to a frost fir with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise touches a frost fir (including with a grapple maneuver), must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be coated with the frost fir's sticky resin. A creature affected by this resin takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and concentration checks (penalties from multiple contacts do not stack). Any enemy grappled by a frost fir takes a -2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape using the Escape Artist skill. Strong alcohol, universal solvent, or any amount of fire damage dealt to a creature coated in resin removes the resin. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A target that fails a DC 10 Reflex save becomes entangled and must hold its breath or risk drowning. The target or an adjacent creature can spend a full-round action on its turn scraping off the clinging fluid, allowing a new Reflex save with a +2 bonus; otherwise, the effect lasts for 1d4 minutes. A fuath can use this ability even if there is no source of water nearby. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.  Vulnerable to Sunlight (Ex) A fuath takes 1 point of Constitution damage after every hour it is exposed to sunlight. Water of a depth of at least 1 foot negates this harmful effect.

A non-goblinoid creature damaged by a goblin dog's bite, who deals damage to a goblin dog with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or who otherwise comes into contact with a goblin dog (including attempts to grapple or ride the creature) must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or break out in an itching rash. A creature affected by this rash takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity and Charisma for 1 day (multiple allergic reactions do not stack). Remove disease or any magical healing removes the rash instantly. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Any creature within 5 feet of the goblin snake must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds by the stench. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same goblin snake's goblin breath for 24 hours. Goblin snakes and goblins are immune to this effect. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Snake Empathy (Ex) This ability functions similarly to a druid's wild empathy ability, but allows a goblin snake to verbally communicate with and be understood by snakes and similar serpentine reptiles. The bonus equals the goblin snake's racial Hit Dice plus its Charisma modifier and a +4 racial bonus.

Three times per day, so long as the golden cat is within 40 feet, the owner can reroll one die roll and take the most favorable result. Only one die can be rerolled each round. This ability is a power of the cat, not the owner, though the owner can simply telepathically communicate its desire to the cat. A golden cat cannot be forced to activate this ability if it does not wish to do so (unless magically compelled). Each time the golden cat activates this ability and the owner rerolls a die, all other creatures (including the owner's allies) within 40 feet of the golden cat must reroll one die roll and take the least favorable result each time.

The target can attempt to burst these entangling vines before the duration expires with a DC 12 Strength check as a full-round action. The save and burst DCs are Constitution-based.  Keepsake (Su) Gourd leshys can pop off the top of their heads and store a single Fine-sized object such as a dagger or potion inside While within the leshy's head, the item is warded by nondetection. In addition, after 24 hours, the item within is cleaned and polished, and, if damaged, repaired as if by a mending spell. Both spell effects have a caster level equal to twice the leshy's Hit Dice (CL 2nd for most gourd leshys).  Seed (Ex) A gourd leshy can hurl its seeds as a ranged attack. If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified by Strength) and affects the target with the gourd leshy's ensnare ability. This attack has a 10-foot range increment.																												
Grig	1.00	400	Tiny	4	17, touch 17, flat-footed 12	4	1	6	3		16		30 ft., fly 40 ft.

As a standard action, a grig can create a catchy tune that compels any creature within a 20-foot spread to dance and caper. A creature can resist this compulsion by making a DC 12 Will save. Creatures that fail are compelled to dance and shuffle their feet, and are effectively staggered as long as the grig continues to fiddle. A grig can maintain this effect for up to 10 rounds per day by concentrating. Once a creature makes the save against a grig's fiddle, it is immune to further fiddle effects from that grig for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The target must be within 30 feet, and can resist this effect with a successful DC 12 Will save-otherwise, the target becomes confused for as long as the grioth concentrates plus 1 additional round after it ceases concentrating, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 3 plus the Grioth's total HD (5 rounds for most grioths). This is a mind-affecting effect, and is equivalent to a 2nd-level spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Mindshock (Su) When a grioth damages a creature with a voidglass weapon, a surge of the grioth's violent psychic energy pulses through the weapon, causing an additional 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. On a critical hit, the creature struck must also succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be confused for 1d2 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect shaken for 1 round; cure 1 save.																												
Gryph	1.00	400	Small	2	13, touch 13, flat-footed 11	15	5	5	1				30 ft., fly 50 ft.

It has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks to maintain a grapple (in addition to the +4 from the grab ability).  Implant Eggs (Ex) Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target it is grappling. As a fullround action, the gryph extends an ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrates the victim's flesh by making a successful sting attack (+5 melee). On a hit, the ovipositor deals 1 point of damage and implants 1d4 eggs in the victim. The eggs draw nutrients from the target's flesh, and give the target the sickened condition. The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous gryph chicks that immediately burrow out of the victim's body.  This deals 2 points of Constitution damage per gryph chick, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away (if needed, use game statistics for a bat familiar to represent a hatchling). Removing implanted eggs requires a DC 20 Heal check (a full-round action); each attempt deals 1 hit point of damage. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against gryph egg implantation, remove disease, heal, or similar effects automatically destroy any implanted gryph eggs.																												
Gryph	1.00	400	Small	2	13, touch 13, flat-footed 11	15	5	5	1				30 ft., fly 50 ft.

An attached gryph is effectively grappling its prey. The gryph loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 11, but holds on with great tenacity and gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls with its bite. Alternatively, an attached gryph can attempt to implant eggs in the target. An attached gryph has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached gryph can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the gryph is removed.  Implant Eggs (Ex) Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target that it is currently attached to as a full-round action by extending an ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrating the victim's flesh by making a successful +4 melee attack. On a hit, the ovipositor inflicts 1 damage and implants 1d4 eggs into the victim's body.  As long as a victim has gryph eggs implanted in his body, he is sickened as the eggs draw nutrients from his blood and flesh. The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous baby gryphs that immediately burrow out of the victim's body. This inflicts 2 points of Constitution damage per baby gryph, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away.  Treat a gryph hatchling as a bat if statistics are needed.  Gryph eggs can be cut out of a victim's body with a successful DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action that inflicts 1 point of damage per attempt.  Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against gryph egg implantation, remove disease or heal immediately destroys any implanted gryph eggs.

A hollow helm that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight, disguised as normal armor. Skull Cage (Ex) A hollow helm sometimes pretends to be normal armor, letting a creature try to wear it before revealing its deadly nature. If the hollow helm makes a successful combat maneuver to grapple an opponent of Medium size or smaller, the grappled creature is also blinded. Creatures that purposefully try to wear a hollow helm are automatically grappled. This blindness lasts until the hollow helm's grapple is broken. A hollow helm cannot attack a creature it is grappling. If a hollow helm is damaged while it is grappling, the creature it is grappling takes an equal amount of damage.

Docile (Ex) Unless specifically trained for combat (see the Handle Animal skill), a Rhianna's hooves are treated as secondary attacks.  Encumbrance Penalty (Ex) Rhiannas lose the benefits of the Run feat whenever they are encumbered. They may still run at 4 times their speed with light encumbrance (up to 228 lbs.), and 3 times their speed with medium (459 lbs.) or heavy (690 lbs.) encumbrance.  Hardy (Ex) Rhiannas are extremely durable creatures. Unlike with other mounts, anytime a hustle, forced march or spurred movement would do damage to these horses, they are allowed a Constitution save to negate the damage.

Anyone within 40 feet of the huggermuggers must succeed at a Will save (DC 12, +1 per huggermugger in the group) or be affected as by a confusion spell for 5 rounds. All huggermuggers in the group must be within 30 feet of each other to create this aura. Each huggermugger may contribute to the confusion aura once per day. A creature that makes a successful save cannot be affected by the confusion aura of any huggermuggers in that group for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. Natural Cunning (Ex) Huggermuggers possess innate cunning and logical ability. This makes them immune to maze spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.

A successful save halves the damage and negates the stun. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Fear Aura (Su) Any creature within 30 feet of a jack-o'- lantern must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 2d6 minutes. If the Will save is successful, the creature is immune to that jack-o'-lantern's fear aura for 24 hours. This is a vision-based mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  Pumpkin Form (Su) A jack-o'-lantern can shrink in size and douse its sinister fiery radiance, allowing it to blend in almost perfectly with normal pumpkins and take 20 on its Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a normal pumpkin. While using this ability, a jack-o'-lantern loses its fear aura. A jack-o'-lantern can use this ability as a full-round action and end it as a free action.  Strangling Ensnare (Ex) A jack-o'-lantern's slam attack entangles the target in its vines for 2d4 rounds unless the target succeeds at a DC 14 Reflex save. The target can attempt to burst these entangling vines before the duration expires with a successful DC 12 Strength check as a full-round action. While the target is entangled, its vines also grasp at the target's mouth. The target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components while it is entangled by the jack-o'- lantern. When a creature is entangled by this ability, the jack-o'-lantern loses its slam attack, but it can end this ability as a free action. The save and the burst DCs are Constitution-based.

This effect functions at CL 6th and has a range of 60 ft., and the target creature must be either willing or helpless (but still gets a saving throw to resist). The save is DC 14 + the Charisma modifier of the jinkin with the highest Charisma score (DC 16 for most groups of jinkins). Alternatively, the group of jinkins can attempt to infuse a magic item with a curse. The nature of this curse is determined randomly; half of these curses make the magic item unreliable (each time the item is used, there is a 20% chance it does not function), while the other half give the item a random requirement (see page 537 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). A jinkin can take part in a tinkering only once per day, and may only tinker with a creature or object that isn't already cursed. Once a tinkering curse is in place, it is permanent until removed via an effect like remove curse. All jinkin tinkerings function as a curse created by a 6th-level caster.

This counts as using Intimidate to demoralize an opponent, and is an extraordinary ability. The krenshar can emit a loud screech while peeling back its skin, causing potent fear in a single creature within 100 feet that can see the krenshar. The targeted creature must make a DC 12 Will save or become frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken (if the target has more than 6 Hit Dice) for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same krenshar's skullface ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Once it has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and slithers off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the land lamprey's appetite has been sated, the land lamprey detaches and seeks a new target.

A creature stepping in a space covered with this slime must succeed on a DC 11 Reflex save or slip and fall prone. The slime remains in the area for 1d2 hours before losing its potency. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Seed (Ex) Once per day, a leaf ray can implant a seed into a helpless target with its stinger. As a full-round action, the leaf ray stings its victim, depositing a seed into the victim's flesh. This process deals 1 hit point of damage to the victim, but the implanted creature isn't subject to the leaf ray's poison in this process. The seed germinates inside the victim, making it sickened while it harbors the leaf ray seed, and dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage to the victim each day the seed grows within. This damage is negated with a successful DC 14 Fortitude save. The seed feeds off the victim's body and only grows into a new leaf ray tree when the victim dies from Constitution damage. Removing an implanted seed requires a successful DC 20 Heal check (a full-round action); each attempt deals 1 hit point of damage. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against a leaf ray seed's implantation, remove disease, heal, or similar effects automatically destroy any implanted seeds.

An entangled opponent suffers tentacle damage and the effect of its poison each round the hold is maintained. An entangled creature still receives a save to avoid the effects of its poison. While a foe is entangled, the sea wasp cannot attack any other creature. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; the effects of the poison are determined by the creature's size (see table below).

It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting. Transparent (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp is nearly invisible floating in the water.

Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect. Viscous (Ex) As described in the sanguine ooze swarm's special abilities, except that the Reflex save DC is 15 and the patches are destroyed if the victim takes any amount of acid damage.

Str 6, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 13	1	2	10	Inner Sea Bestiary	Mock (Su) As a standard action, a mockingfey can magically take on the appearance of any creature it can see. This functions like disguise self, but with no restrictions on duration, creature type, or size. The mockingfey does not change size, and if the creature it's mimicking is larger than it, the mockingfey simply appears to be a miniature version. Anyone interacting with this effect can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the ruse. A mockingfey can maintain a given form indefinitely, but cannot change to any form other than its own without visual reference-once a given disguise has ended, the fey must see the subject again to resume that form.

This pouch contains an extradimensional space and operates like a bag of holding (type I). If this pouch is separated from the monaciello, all of its former contents are lost, and it becomes a normal bag that contains a number of coins equal to double the treasure value of a creature of the gremlin's CR. A monaciello that loses its pouch must create a new one, a process that takes 1d4 days. Until the new pouch is finished, it remains a non-magical bag, only becoming a fully functional extradimensional space once completed.  Stymie Channeling (Su) A monaciello gremlin is surrounded by an aura of blasphemy. Any creatures channeling energy within 20 feet of a monaciello must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be unable to channel for that round. The use is not lost, but the action is wasted.

Str 11, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 6	0	-1	10	Tome of Horrors Complete	Damage Reversal (Ex) When struck by any attack that would normally damage the nilbog, it actually gains hit points equal to the damage the attack would have otherwise dealt. A nilbog gains any extra hit points above its normal total as temporary hit points, though it can never have more than twice its normal hit points. (Excess hit points are simply lost.). The nilbog can only be damaged through the use of curative magic and effects (cure light wounds and healing potions, for instance). Curative magic deals damage equal to the amount it would normally heal. Spatio-Temporal Reversal (Ex) A nilbog constantly emanates an aura of confusion in a 20-foot-radius. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or be affected as if by a confusion spell (caster level 4th). The save DC is Constitution-based.

When two or more ningyos are grappling the same creature, each gains a +1 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks and a +1 bonus on grapple damage rolls.  Nocturnal Undeath (Su) The body of a ningyo never rests peacefully. Every night, an hour after sundown, an intact ningyo corpse animates; its type changes to undead (aquatic), and it gains undead immunities, bonus hit points based on its Charisma instead of Constitution, and the startle ability. At dawn, the undead ningyo becomes a corpse again. An undead ningyo knows when the dawn is coming and attempts to find shelter so it is not discovered as a corpse. A ningyo missing a limb, head, or tail does not animate at night, but can do so if reunited with its missing body part. A ningyo corpse that is burned or torn apart and its pieces scattered does not rise as an undead.  Poison Flesh (Ex) Any creature that bites a ningyo or swallows any part of it becomes poisoned. Ningyo Flesh: Ingested; save Fort DC 12; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/minute for 4 minutes; effect 1d2 Int damage; cure 2 saves.  Startle (Su) If an undead ningyo attacks in the surprise round, its target must attempt a DC 11 Will save. Success means the target is shaken for 1 round; failure means it is frightened for 1d4 rounds. The target can only be affected by that ningyo's startle once every 24 hours. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are immune to this ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Swarming (Ex) Up to two ningyos can share the same square at the same time. If two ningyos in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.

For example, ogrillons can use special ogre or orc weapons or magic items with racially specific ogre or orc powers as if they were ogres or orcs. Reinforced Fists (Ex) Ogrillons are considered to be armed even when unarmed (i.e., they do not provoke attacks of opportunity from armed opponents when attacking them and can themselves still make an attack of opportunity against an opponent that attacks unarmed). Additionally, they always deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage when fighting unarmed.

Each round the onwu azu is grappling its foe, it automatically deals its bite damage.  Glide (Ex) An onwu azu can launch itself into the air and glide for up to 1 minute (depending on water and weather conditions, at the GM's discretion). When gliding, it has a fly speed of 60 feet with clumsy maneuverability and gains Flyby Attack.

Each round the pickled punk is grappling its foe, it automatically deals bite damage each round.  Death Throes (Ex) When a pickled punk is destroyed, it discorporates into a fleshy sludge. Any creatures adjacent to a pickled punk when it is destroyed must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round.  Irritant (Ex) The water in a pickled punk's jar is highly irritating to all living creatures. A creature damaged by a pickled punk's bite that deals damage to pickled punk with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or that otherwise comes into contact with a pickled punk or the water in its jar, must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or break out in an itching rash. A creature affected by this rash takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity and Charisma for 24 hours (multiple allergic reactions do not stack). Remove disease or any magical healing removes the rash instantly. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Opportune (Ex) Though Tiny, a pickled punk can extend its deformed limbs to make attacks of opportunity as if it had a reach of 5 feet. This ability doesn't allow a pickled punk to attack adjacent creatures as if it truly had a reach of 5 feet.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  If a rakkelthorn toad is killed or subdued before it has fired all of its thorns in a given day, the poison can be extracted from its remaining thorns. A successful DC 16 Heal or Craft (alchemy) check allows the poison to be changed into a mild anesthetic; one rakkelthorn toad provides enough for one dose. A single dose of this anesthetic, applied to the wound of an injured creature, provides a +2 circumstance bonus to Heal checks (multiple doses do not stack). This bonus lasts for one hour, after which time the anesthesia wears off. Poison cannot be extracted from thorns that have been fired by the rakklethorn.  Thorns (Ex) From its back, the rakklethorn toad can fire a volley of thorns once per round as a standard action. All thorns in the cluster either hit or miss their target and deal 1d6 points of damage plus poison (see above). This attack has a range of 50 feet with no range increment. The rakklethorn toad can launch a total of 6 such volleys per day.

Add +10 to the DC to track a skulk in these environments.  Chameleon Skin (Ex) A skulk's racial bonus to Stealth comes from his ability to change the color of his skin to match his surroundings, even complex or regular patterns like bricks and mortar. A skulk loses this conditional bonus if he is wearing armor, or if he wears any clothing that covers more than one-quarter of his body, as skulks can only change their own flesh, not things they carry. A skulk normally conceals small items behind his body; by putting his back to a wall and changing his front half, he can hide the item because observers don't have line of sight to the item.

This, combined with their natural sneakiness, grants them a +15 racial bonus on Stealth checks when hiding, but only while the majority of their skin is visible to the naked eye. Thus they cannot use this ability while wearing armor or any clothing more than a loincloth. Skulks favor wearing cloaks when lurking on the fringes of civilized society which they can quickly remove so as to make full use of their chameleon blend ability. Cowardice (Ex) Skulks suffer a -4 penalty to their effective Wisdom against Intimidate skill checks and a -4 penalty vs. fear-based spells and effects due to their innate cowardice.

Creatures hitting an acid quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack. Acid Swimmer (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic nature of their environment on their home plane. Drench (Ex) The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals the quasi-elemental's HD). Fumes (Ex) The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body act as an inhaled poison. Creatures within 5 ft. of an acid quasi-elemental must make succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage each round. This poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves more than 5 ft. away from the acid quasielemental. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by water. An acid quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasielemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasielemental within its area of effect. Damage from waterbased attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasielemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental.

If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Earth Mastery (Ex) An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.

Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds.

Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A control water spell cast on an area containing a burrowing ice elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the elemental climbs must be icy. The elemental can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Numbing Cold (Su) When an ice elemental deals cold damage to a creature, that creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is listed in the elemental's stat block and is Constitution-based. Snow Vision (Ex) An ice elemental can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Lava Puddle (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a puddle of lava (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) that fills its space to a depth of 2-3 inches and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round. The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after a number of rounds equal to the elemental's Hit Dice. At the GM's discretion, this puddle of lava could start secondary fires.

It cannot use this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.  Entrap (Ex) The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3 rounds of immersion in water.

Burn (Ex) A smoke elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn as hot as a true fire elemental's flames.  Engulf (Ex) A smoke elemental can engulf creatures of its size or smaller into its smoky form as part of a standard action. It cannot make any other attack in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that are not adjacent to them.  Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.  Incombustible Aura (Su) All creatures within 30 feet of a wood idol gain fire resistance 10. This effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the wood idol's aura. Any time a being makes use of this resistance to any degree, the wood idol takes 1 point of normal damage, appearing more and more charred as it takes damage. This ability ceases to function should a wood idol have only 1 hit point and does not reactivate until it regains hit points.  Primeval Curse (Su) Once per day, a wood idol can force a creature within 15 feet to make a DC 12 Will save or be cursed.  This curse functions similarly to the spell bestow curse, except that it can only either decrease an ability score by -4 or cause a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. In addition, while affected, the skin of the target takes on a rough, wooden appearance. A wood idol's curse can only affect one creature at a time, and should it curse another creature, the first target is no longer affected. This effect can be removed by remove curse or by eating a goodberry. The save DC is Charisma based.  Regeneration (Ex) A wood idol's regeneration only functions while it is standing on wood, grass, or earth. Fire deals normal damage to a wood idol.  Share Abilities (Su) An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).  Skills In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.

Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check or the application of a cure spell or some other healing magic.

Infernal Jinx (Su) Benabak has developed the ability to curse other creatures with ill luck. As a standard action, he can jinx a creature within 30 feet who fails a DC 13 Will save. A jinxed creature takes a -2 penalty on its next d20 roll. The effects of the jinx wear off after 1 minute. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to Benabak's infernal jinx for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Any creature within the area must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 hour. Blindheims can see normally in the light generated by their eyes, which illuminates a 30-foot spread with bright light. Creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity take the normal penalties within 30 feet of a blindheim that is using its blinding gaze. A blindheim can activate or suppress this ability as a free action. This save DC is Constitution-based.

It can see normally in this light and functions normally in areas of darkness (but not deeper darkness). A creature looking at a blindheim when its eye beams are "on" must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 hour. A successful save renders the creature immune to the same blindheim's eye beams for 24 hours. The blindness can be cured by remove blindness or more powerful magic. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Any creature that attempts a combat maneuver or Escape Artist check against a bloodbrush also takes this barb damage, regardless of success. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger an attacker in this way. A grappled creature takes barb damage at the start of the bloodbrush's turn.  Flammable (Ex) If a bloodbrush takes fire damage, it catches fire (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444), but does not take damage for catching fire in the round it ignites. It takes 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of each turn unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex save to extinguish the flame. A burning bloodbrush inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage with its barbs and slam attacks and to any creature that strikes it with a melee attack as its barbs ability.  Poison (Ex) Barbs-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect dazed; cure 1 save; no effect on creatures immune to mind-affecting effects.

Str 14, Dex 14, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 9	2	4	17 (21 vs. trip)	AP 34	Hold Breath (Ex) A bog strider can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning. Tremor Tap (Ex) Bog striders can send and receive messages by creating and sensing silent vibrations on the surface of any body of water they currently tread. The range of communication extends outward 120 feet to all other bog striders within line of effect on or under the water. Because the ripples created on the water prove omni-directional, bog striders can communicate with multiple targets at the same time. Only bog striders can understand this form of communication. This ability also grants bog striders tremorsense in water at a range of 120 feet. Water Sprint (Ex) Once per hour, a bog strider can move up to 5 times its normal speed (250 feet) on water when making a charge or retreating from an enemy. Once it decides to increase its movement in this fashion, the effect lasts for up to 4 rounds, after which a bog strider becomes fatigued for as many rounds as it chose to move at a higher speed. Water Stride (Su) A bog strider can tread upon rivers, lakes, and flooded swamplands or marshes as if under the effects of the water walk spell. It also gains an increased movement rate by using the surface tension and its multiple legs to propel itself across the water.																												
Boggard	2.00	600	Medium	-1	14, touch 9, flat-footed 14	22	5	0	1				20 ft., swim 30 ft.	morningstar +5 (1d8+3), tongue -1 touch (sticky tongue)		5 ft.	5 ft.	terrifying croak	Str 15, Dex 9, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 10	2	4	13	PFRPG Bestiary	Hold Breath (Ex) A boggard can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to four times its Constitution score before it risks drowning or suffocating. Sticky Tongue (Ex) A creature hit by a boggard's tongue attack cannot move more than 10 feet away from the boggard and takes a -2 penalty to AC as long as the tongue is attached (this penalty does not stack if multiple tongues are attached). The tongue can be removed by making an opposed Strength check as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of slashing damage to the tongue (AC 11, damage does not deplete the boggard's actual hit points). The boggard cannot move more than 10 feet away from the target, but the boggard can release its tongue as a free action. Unlike a giant frog, a boggard cannot pull targets toward it with its tongue. Swamp Stride (Ex) A boggard can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a boggard normally. Terrifying Croak (Su) Once per hour, a boggard can, as a standard action, emit a loud and horrifying croak. Any nonboggard creature within 30 feet of the boggard must make a DC 13 Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed at this save cannot be affected again by the same boggard's croak for 24 hours. Creatures that are already shaken become frightened for 1d4 rounds instead. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Bone Delver	2.00	600	Medium	3	16, touch 13, flat-footed 13	13	2	3	4				30 ft.	shovel +4 (1d6+1 plus disease) or 2 claws +4 (1d4+1 plus disease)		5 ft.	5 ft.	grave light, scream of agony	Str 13, Dex 16, Con -, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 14	1	2	15	Tome of Horrors 4	Disease (Ex) Filth Fever: claws or shovel-injury; save DC 13 Fort; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/ day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Grave Light (Su) A bone delver's lantern sheds light in a 10-foot radius. Living creatures within the area take 1 point of damage each round. Additionally, a bone delver's fast healing only works when it is within 10 feet of its lantern. The lantern can be extinguished with a bless spell (it relights after 1 hour) or attacked and destroyed (hardness 5, hp 10). This lantern functions only for the bone delver to which it belongs. In the hands of living creatures it functions differently (see below).  Scream of Agony (Su) A bone delver can unleash a bone-chilling shriek that affects all who hear it within 30 feet. An affected creature must make a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d4+2 rounds. Creatures with more than 4 HD are unaffected by this attack. Creatures that successfully save are immune to the scream of agony of that bone delver for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shovel A bone delver suffers no penalties on attack rolls when wielding a shovel as a weapon.																												
Bone Idol	2.00	600	Diminutive	1	16, touch 15, flat-footed 15	16	1	2	2				10 ft.	bite +3 (1d2-4 plus mad rage)		1 ft.	0 ft.	mad rage	Str 3, Dex 12, Con -, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 12	3	0	6	AP 27	Feverish Fortitude (Su) All creatures within 30 feet of a bone idol gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against disease and poison.  The effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the bone idol's aura.  Inanimate (Ex) An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise. Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.  Mad Rage (Su) Any creature bitten by a bone idol must make a DC 16 Will save or fly into an uncontrollable, violent rage. Those affected by this rage are treated as being under the effects of both the spells rage and confusion for 1 minute. However, whenever the affected creature rolls a confusion result that would lead it to flee or attack the bone idol, the idol instead chooses a target for it to attack. This is a mind-affecting effect.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Share Abilities (Su) An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).  Skills In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.  Zombie Fetish (Su) Any zombie created within 30 feet of a bone idol rises as a fast zombie (see page 289 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for details).

They favor moonseed berries as poison and usually have a plentiful supply readily available.  These small berries are bluish-purple and resemble wild grapes. They are highly poisonous and are often mixed with food or crushed and smeared on a weapon or object.  Moonseed Berries: poison-contact or ingested; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 1 save; Price 1,500 gp.

An attached burrowing lamprey is effectively grappling its prey. The burrowing lamprey loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity. A burrowing lamprey has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached burrowing lamprey can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the burrowing lamprey is removed.  Flesh Burrow (Ex) At the start of its next turn, the round after it attaches to its prey, a burrowing lamprey burrows into the target's flesh and subjects it to its poison. Applying flame to the point of entry deals 1d6 points of fire damage to both the host and the burrowing lamprey. Cutting the lamprey out works, but the longer the lamprey remains in the host, the more damage this method does. Cutting a lamprey out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 20 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage to the host per round the lamprey has been inside it. If the Heal check succeeds, one lamprey is removed. Remove disease instantly kills any burrowing lampreys inside a host.  Poison (Ex) Flesh burrow-injury; save DC 14 Fort; effect 1d2 Constitution damage; cure -. The save DC is Constitution-based. The lamprey's poison liquefies the host's organs. A successful saving throw can prevent Con damage for that round, but the only cure is to remove the burrowing lamprey from the host.																												
Cacodaemon	2.00	600	Tiny	4	16, touch 12, flat-footed 16	19	2	5	4				5 ft., fly 50 ft.

In addition to the normal effects of the disease, as long as a victim is infected, the cacodaemon can telepathically communicate with the creature over any distance (as long as they remain on the same plane).  Soul Lock (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a cacodaemon can ingest the spirit of any sentient creature that has died within the last minute. This causes a soul gem to grow inside of the cacodaemon's gut, which it can regurgitate as a standard action. A soul gem is a fine-sized object with 1 hit point and hardness 2. Destroying a soul gem frees the soul within, though it does not return the deceased creature to life. This is a death effect. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a soul gem requires a DC 12 caster level check. Failure results in the spell having no effect, while success shatters the victim's soul gem and returns the creature to life as normal. If the soul gem rests in an unholy location, such as that created by the spell unhallow, the DC of this caster level check increases by +2. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based.  Any evil outsider can, as a standard action, ingest a soul gem. Doing so frees the soul within, but condemns it to one of the lower planes (though the soul can be returned to life as normal). The outsider gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to its Hit Dice.																												
Cadaver	2.00	600	Medium	5	13, touch 11, flat-footed 12	16	0	1	3				30 ft.	2 claws +2 (1d4+1 plus disease) and bite +2 (1d6+1  plus disease)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 13, Dex 13, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 10	1	2	13	Tome of Horrors Complete	Disease (Ex) Filth fever: Claw and bite-injury; save Fort DC 11; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Reanimation (Su) When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a cadaver is not destroyed; rather it falls inert and begins the process of reanimating by regaining 1 hit point per round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit point total (minus damage dealt by magical attacks and weapons), it stands up, ready to fight again.  If the creature is destroyed by channeled positive energy, it cannot reanimate. If a cleric casts gentle repose on the cadaver when it is reduced to 0 hit points, it cannot reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation, causing the creature to regain hit points at half the normal rate (i.e. 1 hit point every other round).																												
Caliban	2.00	600	Medium	2	14, touch 12, flat-footed 12	22	1	6	3				30 ft., swim 20 ft.	handaxe +5 (1d6+1/x3), claw +0 (1d4) or  2 claws +5 (1d4+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	share deformity, unsettling scream	Str 13, Dex 15, Con 10, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 11	4	5	17	Tears At Bitter Manor	Share Deformity (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a caliban can make a melee touch attack against a humanoid creature. If it hits, the opponent must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or have its form warped horribly. An affected creature takes 4 points of ability damage to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (caliban's choice). Until this ability damage is healed, the caliban gains a +4 bonus to that same ability score. This ability damage heals automatically after 24 hours. A creature can't be affected by more than one instance of this ability at a time. This is a curse effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Unsettling Scream (Ex) As a standard action, a caliban can wail horribly. All non-caliban creatures within 60 feet that can hear must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be deafened for 1 round and shaken for 1 minute. A creature affected by this ability is immune to the unsettling scream of the same caliban for 24 hours, regardless of whether its save is successful. This is a sonic fear effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Cambion	2.00	600	Medium	1	15, touch 11, flat-footed 14	22	5	2	4		13		30 ft.	mwk scimitar +6 (1d6+2/18-20), claw +0 (1d4+1) or  2 claws +5 (1d4+2)	mwk composite longbow +5 (1d8+2/x3)	5 ft.	5 ft.	sadistic strike, sinfrenzy	Str 15, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 12, Cha 14	3	5	16	AP 76	Sadistic Strike (Su) Cambions are particularly cruel, and they excel at causing pain and anguish. A cambion always treats any weapon he attacks with (including natural weapons and spells that require attack rolls to hit) as if the demon had the Improved Critical feat for that weapon, increasing the weapon's threat range as appropriate.  Sinfrenzy (Su) Every cambion carries within his being an excessive capacity for one of the seven classical sins-this focus is determined at the moment of the cambion's birth and depends on the nature of his humanoid parent's greatest sin. Once per day for a number of rounds equal to his Hit Dice, a cambion can turn himself over to his sin and enter into a frenzied state as a free action. While a cambion is in this frenzy, his land speed increases by 10 feet and he gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and attack rolls. These bonuses do not stack with those granted by haste or similar effects, but if the cambion has at least 1 level in the class  listed for his specific sin, the sinfrenzy grants an additional effect as summarized below.  Envy (cleric): Cambion clerics covet the power of the gods themselves. While an envious cambion is in a sinfrenzy, his channeled energy effect increases by 1d6.  Gluttony (alchemist): Cambion alchemists take great pleasure in drinking their extracts, potions, mutagens, and even poisons. While a gluttonous cambion is in a sinfrenzy, his bombs deal an additional die of damage.  Greed (rogue): Cambion rogues are obsessed with gathering as much wealth and power as they can. While a greedy cambion is in a sinfrenzy, he deals an additional die of sneak attack damage.  Lust (bard): Cambion bards seek to dominate and control as many hedonistic slaves as they can through magic and intimidation. While a lustful cambion bard is in a sinfrenzy, the effects of his inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics abilities increase by 1. The save DCs of the cambion's bardic performances also increase by 1 when he is in this state.  Pride (wizard): Cambion wizards believe their magic is greater than all others. While a prideful cambion is in a sinfrenzy, his spell save DCs increase by 1.  Sloth (fighter): Cambion fighters carry the essence of sloth within, so much so that even their very blood seems to flow slowly from cut veins. While a slothful cambion fighter is in a sinfrenzy, he gains 2 bonus hit points per Hit Die.  Wrath (ranger): Cambion rangers charge their attacks with savage hatred. While a wrathful cambion ranger is in a sinfrenzy, his favored enemy bonuses increase by 2.

They can faultlessly recite conversations they heard hundreds of years before. They also have the power to erase portions of their own memories, which they do (usually under orders from superior angels) to protect sensitive information.  Lesser Protective Aura (Su) A cassisian has a lesser form of the protective aura possessed by more powerful angels.  This protective aura grants the cassisian a +2 deflection bonus to its AC against evil foes, and a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made against evil effects or spells cast by evil creatures. This aura extends to a radius of 5 feet, but can only benefit one additional creature other than the cassisian at any one time. A cassisian's protective aura is fragile, and as soon as an evil creature successfully strikes the cassisian, or as soon as the cassisian fails a saving throw against an evil source, its protective aura fades away and is no longer applicable. The cassisian can reactivate its protective aura by spending 1 minute concentrating upon the task.																												
Cat Sith	2.00	600	Tiny	3	15, touch 15, flat-footed 12	19	4	6	2				30 ft.	2 claws +4 (1d2-1 plus no luck), bite +4 (1d3-1)		2-1/2 ft.	0 ft.	false curse (DC 15)	Str 8, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 15	3	4	13	Familiar Folio	False Curse (Su) Once per day, a cat sith can fool a creature into believing it has been cursed by the cat sith's black magic. The target must be within 60 feet and must be able to see the cat sith to be affected by the false curse (Will DC 15 negates). An affected creature takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks, as if affected by bestow curse. Because this effect is not a true curse, the target gains a new saving throw to end the effect at the beginning of each day. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting effect that can be affected by remove curse. The save DC is Charisma-based.  No Luck (Su) A creature hit by a cat sith's claws must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be stricken with lucklessness. For 1d4 rounds, the affected creature can't benefit from any luck bonuses. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This touch attack has a range of 60 feet and no range increment. A creature struck by a cave fisher's filament becomes attached to the sticky thread. As a standard action, a creature can rip the filament free with a DC 20 Strength check. A caught creature can also attempt to escape a filament by making a DC 25 Escape Artist check. A filament is AC 14 (touch 12), has 5 hit points, and has DR 15/slashing.

This touch attack has a range of 60 feet and no range increment. A creature struck by a cave fisher's filament becomes attached to the sticky thread.  As a standard action, a creature can rip the filament free with a DC 20 Strength check. A caught creature can also attempt to escape a filament by making a DC 25 Escape Artist check. A filament is AC 14 (touch 12), has 5 hit points, and has DR 15/slashing. An application of liquid with high alcohol content (or a dose of universal solvent) dissolves the adhesive and releases the creature caught by the filament.  A cave fisher can have only one filament active at a time.																												
Cave Moray	2.00	600	Medium	3	15, touch 13, flat-footed 12	19	4	6	2				20 ft.	bite +5 (2d6+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	ambush, recoil attack	Str 14, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 10	3	5	18	Tome of Horrors Complete	Ambush (Ex) If a cave moray surprises its opponent, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its attack roll for that round.  Recoil Attack (Ex) A cave moray lunges out of its cyst up to 5 feet to strike at passing opponents or prey. This attack is swift enough to attack running or flying creatures. A cave moray's recoil attack is always considered a charge attack since it recoils into its cyst after an attack to lunge at its opponent again.																												
Caypup	2.00	600	Small	4	14, touch 11, flat-footed 14	22	3	3	2				30 ft.	bite +6 (1d4+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	thunderous growl	Str 15, Dex 11, Con 14, Int 6, Wis 9, Cha 12	3	4	14	Familiar Folio	Thunderous Growl (Su) Three times per day, a caypup can issue a rumbling growl from its throat that sounds like distant thunder and scares away potential attackers. Creatures within 15 feet of the caypup must succeed at a DC 12 Will save to attack the caypup (as if affected by sanctuary). The caypup can choose to bestow the same effect on an adjacent ally as well. This effect lasts for 3 rounds or until the caypup or its ally attacks (whichever comes first), after which time the caypup must wait at least 1d6 rounds before using this ability again. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Ceru	2.00	600	Tiny	6	16, touch 14, flat-footed 14	22	5	5	2		13		20 ft.	gore +7 (1d3-1 plus poison)		2-1/2 ft.	0 ft.	luckbringer	Str 8, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 12, Cha 15	3	3	12 (16 vs. trip)	Inner Sea Bestiary	Luckbringer (Su) As a standard action, a ceru can bring luck or misfortune upon any creature it can see within 30 feet. This effect lasts for 1 round, and the ceru decides in advance whether the modified luck is good or bad. If the ceru grants bad luck, anytime the target makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A successful DC 13 Will save negates this effect. If the ceru grants good luck, the target must choose a single roll (as above) prior to rolling, and may roll the chosen roll twice and take the higher result. A creature can only be affected by this ability once per 24 hours, and the ceru may use the ability once per day for every 4 HD it has (minimum once per day). The save DC is Charisma-based. If the ceru is a familiar, it may use its master's character level, if higher, in place of its racial Hit Dice for determining the number of uses of this ability, and for calculating the save DC (DC = 10 + 1/2 or the master's character level + the master's Cha modifier).  Poison (Ex) Gore-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.

While in this state, the charau-ka automatically fails Stealth checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal components (or use items that require command words to activate), but functions as if under the effects of a haste spell. The charauka can continue shrieking for up to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round.  Thrown-Weapon Mastery (Ex) Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka gain Throw Anything as a bonus feat. In addition, a charau-ka gains a +1 racial bonus on all thrown weapons, and their threat range for thrown weapons is doubled, as if the charau-ka possessed the Improved Critical feat for all thrown weapons. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.																												
Cheetah	2.00	600	Medium	8	15, touch 14, flat-footed 11	19	5	7	2				50 ft.	bite +6 (1d6+3 plus trip), 2 claws +6 (1d3+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.

Str 13, Dex 16, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 6	2	4	17	Daughters Of Fury	Inhale Flames (Ex) As a standard action, a chimney troll can inhale a single nonmagical fire up to the size of a campfire within 30 feet. This extinguishes the fire and grants the chimney troll regeneration 3 (acid, cold) for 3 rounds. If the fire is attended (such as fire on a held torch), a successful DC 13 Reflex save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Soot Breath (Su) As a standard action, a chimney troll can exhale a searing cloud of smoke and cinders that fills the lungs of a targeted creature within 30 feet. The victim takes 1d6 points of fire damage and becomes nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A successful DC 13 Fortitude save halves the fire damage taken and negates the nausea effect. This ability can be used once each time the  chimney troll inhales flames and only within 3 rounds of using that ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Wicked Blood (Ex) Chimney trolls cannot heal hit point damage naturally (such as by resting).																												
Choker	2.00	600	Small	6	17, touch 13, flat-footed 15	16	2	3	4				20 ft., climb 10 ft.	2 tentacles +6 (1d4+3 plus grab)		5 ft.	10 ft.	constrict (1d4+3), grab (Large), strangle	Str 16, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 7	2	+4 (+8 grappling)	16	PFRPG Bestiary	Grab (Ex) A choker can use its grab attack against a foe of up to Large size.

The ooze's touch deals 8 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Corrosive Slime (Ex) Choleric oozes are composed of caustic chemicals. Any living creature that begins its turn affected by the swarm's viscous ability takes 1d4 points of acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by the creature takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 15 Reflex saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. Viscous (Ex) As described in the sanguine ooze swarm's special abilities, except that the Reflex save DC is 15 and the patches are destroyed if the victim takes any amount of electricity damage.

Clockwork Familiar	2.00	600	Tiny	6	18, touch 16, flat-footed 14	16	1	5	2			vulnerable to electricity	30 ft., fly 50 ft. (perfect)	bite +7 (1d3 plus 1d6 electricity)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 10, Dex 14, Con 10, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 11	3	3	15	AP 63	Advice (Ex) Clockwork familiars have an innate understanding of how things work, granting their masters a +2 bonus on all Craft and Use Magic Device checks.  Item Installation (Ex) Each clockwork familiar is made with the ability to carry a specific type of magic item inside its body. This item type is chosen at the time of the construct's creation, and cannot be changed. While the creature cannot activate or use the item for its original function, it gains certain constant abilities from the resonant magic fields, and can drain the item's magic as a free action in order to gain additional magical effects. In addition, any clockwork construct can drain a single charge or spell level from its installed item to heal itself 1d6 hit points as a standard action. Removing a spent item and installing a new one is a full-round action.  Potion: The clockwork familiar gains a constant protection from good/evil/law/chaos effect (one type only, chosen each time a new potion is installed). In addition, a clockwork familiar can drain the magic from the potion in order to gain the ability to include in the effect a single creature whose shoulder it's perched on. While perched on a character's shoulder, it acts like a worn object with no body slot. While the familiar can move from person to person, thus transferring the benefit, latching on or unlatching from a shoulder is a move action. This ability to include others in the protection effect lasts for 1 minute per spell level of the potion drained.  Scroll: The clockwork familiar gains a constant detect magic effect as a spell-like ability. Draining magic from a scroll allows the familiar to cast a single identify spell on behalf of its master for each spell level of the spell inscribed on the scroll-these castings may be stored and saved, though a scroll used in this manner becomes instantly useless, even if not all spell levels have been drained.  Wand: The clockwork familiar gains the ability to spit a gobbet of acid up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack, dealing 1d4 points of damage. Draining a charge increases the damage to 2d4 points for a single attack. This charge is spent before the attack is rolled.																												
Clockwork Overseer	2.00	600	Small	1	15, touch 14, flat-footed 14	21	0	1	1				40 ft.	slam +5 (1d6+2)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 14, Dex 12, Con -, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 10	2	4	15	Tome of Horrors Complete	Independent Clockwork (Su) An overseer can move beyond the brain gear's normal area of influence while maintaining contact with it. Normally, a brain gear can control only clockworks that are within two miles of its position. A brain gear can control an overseer that stays within 10 miles of its position. In addition, the overseer can act as a field commander for up to 20 HD worth of clockworks that are within 100 feet of its position. These clockworks are considered to be in contact with the brain gear so long as the overseer is in contact with it.																												
Clockwork Parasite	2.00	600	Tiny	0	14, touch 12, flat-footed 12	22	1	1	0				20 ft.	bite +7 (1d4+1)		2-1/2 ft.	0 ft.		Str 12, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 8, Cha 8	4	2	13 (21 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Control Host (Su) By burrowing into the base of a corpse's skull and attaching itself with its pincers, a parasite clockwork can animate the creature (similar to an animate dead spell). The animated creature uses its own HD, base attack, saves, and hit points. It has an effective Wisdom of 10 and Charisma of 1. It does not have an Intelligence score. The host loses all skills, feats, class abilities, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities (including the ability to cast spells) it possessed in life. It retains its AC and any natural attacks it possessed, including proficiency with weapons. A host retains any proficiency with armor and shields it possessed while alive. Spells such as detect undead or detect magic do not reveal the presence of the parasite or host. So long as the parasite clockwork remains in contact with the host, the control remains in effect. A host brought to 0 or less hit points is destroyed, but can be repaired by the clockwork parasite using its self-repair ability (though this only works if the host is brought to 0 or less hit points; a host does not gain the self-repair ability of the parasite while "alive"). Self-Repair (Ex) A clockwork parasite regains 1 hit point per round. Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects).

Str 19, Dex 14, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	2	6	20	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Net (Ex) As a standard action, a clockwork servant can launch a net from its shoulder. The launcher itself can contain up to five nets-loading a folded net into the launcher is a standard action. Some clockwork servants are outfitted with masterwork or even magic nets, although the clockwork servant presented here is armed with standard nets.  Repair Clockwork (Ex) Clockwork servants are adept at repairing other clockwork constructs. As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, a clockwork servant can repair damage done to either itself or an adjacent clockwork creature, healing 1d10 points of damage to the target.

As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The crocodile inflicts its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the crocodile maintains its grapple.  Hold Breath (Ex) A crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.  Sprint (Ex) Once per minute a crocodile may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40 feet for 1 round.

Once a creature makes a saving throw against a particular cythnigot's horrific appearance, that creature is immune to the horrific appearance of all cythnigots for 24 hours. A spellcaster that has a cythnigot as a familiar is immune to the horrific appearance of all cythnigots, and also gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against any qlippoth's horrific appearance.  Spores (Su) Any creature bitten by a cythnigot must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or become infested by the creature's otherworldly spores. These spores cause twitching spikes and hideous pallid growths of hair-like fibers to erupt from the bite wound and to writhe and wrap around the target's limbs. A creature suffering from these spores is entangled, and can attempt a new DC 11 Fortitude save in later rounds as a standard action to rip the tendrils free and escape the entangled condition. The effects of multiple cythnigot bites on a creature do not stack. Plant creatures take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes the dweomercat's spell resistance. If it chooses, the dweomercat can immediately make a full attack against the spell's caster as though pouncing. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If there is no safe space adjacent to the caster-or if the dweomercat chooses-the dweomercat can forgo using this ability.

This bonus also applies on opposed Charisma checks against a charmed creature within the aura.  Lashing Chains (Ex) Erinats have 5-foot reach when attacking on their turn with their spiked chains, though they don't threaten adjacent squares when it is not their turn.  Malicious Mischief (Su) A pair of erinats working together for 1 round can present an item and compel a creature to take it. This functions as beguiling giftAPG (DC 13), but rather than using the item in the appropriate fashion, the recipient is compelled to use the item to attack a random non-gremlin creature within 30 feet, even if the recipient must use the item as an improvised weapon. Additionally, a group of six erinats working together over the course of 1 hour can create an effect identical to malicious spiteUM (DC 16) on any living creature. This effect functions at CL 6th, and the target creature must be either willing or helpless.

If the hood's attack succeeds, it can immediately make a grapple check to grab its target and constrict. The hood's crawling tendrils wrap themselves tightly around its victim, seeking entry into the creature's ears, nose, and throat, making it difficult to remove. Any attacks against the hood deal half damage to the hood and its grappled target inside.  Strangle (Ex) A grappling executioner's hood entirely covers its opponent's head with an airtight grip. A creature that is grappled by the hood cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see Suffocation, Pathfinder Core Rulebook) unless it doesn't speak or breathe through its head.  Vulnerability to Alcohol (Ex) Strong alcohol harms the hood.  Every quart poured on it causes 1 point of damage. Four quarts of alcohol incapacitates it and forces it to release a grappled target.

If the hood's attack succeeds, it can immediately attempt a grapple check against the target, and if successful, the executioner's hood can constrict.  Strangle (Ex) A grappling executioner's hood entirely covers its opponent's head with an airtight grip. A creature that is grappled by the hood cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see Suffocation, Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445), unless it doesn't speak or breathe through its head.

It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast.  Paralysis (Su)Creatures damaged by a ghast's natural attacks must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Unlike ghouls, A ghast's paralysis even affects elves Unlike hold person and similar effects, a paralysis effect does not allow a new save each round. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown. The duration of the paralysis varies and is included in the creature's description.  Stench (Ex) Ghast's exude an overwhelming stink of death and corruption in a 10-foot radius.  Those within the stench must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, or be sickened for 1d6+4 minutes																												
Ghelarn	2.00	600	Large	0	14, touch 9, flat-footed 14	22	4	1	5	carapace		vulnerable to sonic	30 ft.	2 tentacles +4 (1d6+3)		10 ft.	10 ft.	entrap (DC 14, 1d8 rounds, hardness 5, hp 8), leeching tendrils	Str 17, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 3, Wis 14, Cha 3	2	6	16	AP 85	Carapace (Ex) A ghelarn typically shelters within a hardened, rocklike shell that houses all of its vital organs. By withdrawing its tentacles and sensory stalks into its shell, the ghelarn gains total cover until the beginning of its next turn. The shell doesn't provide cover against targeted spells, and the ghelarn's movement is limited to downward burrowing during this time. The benefits of the shell can be lost if sundered (hardness 5, 8 hit points, regenerates in 2d6 days), and a ghelarn caught without its carapace loses its natural armor bonus.  Entrap (Ex) A ghelarn secretes a quagmire of sticky fluid a few feet below the sand where it lives. This fluid extends in a 10-foot radius around the creature and acts to trap victims, making it easier for the ghelarn to attack prey with its tentacles or feed upon it with its leeching tendrils. This otherwise acts as the entrap universal monster rule.  Hibernate (Ex) When food is scarce, a ghelarn can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time. When it enters hibernation, the ghelarn nestles itself in the sand and fills in its porous carapace with sticky excretions that quickly harden to seal the creature from the elements. When hibernating, the ghelarn doesn't have to eat or drink. A ghelarn remains in a state of hibernation until it senses another living creature within 10 feet, at which point it dissolves the seals on its carapace over the course of 1d4 minutes.  Leeching Tendrils (Ex) A living creature that spends more than a single round ensnared within a ghelarn's entrapping fluid becomes targeted by invasive tendrils from the ghelarn's lower body. These feeding stalks deal 1 point of bleed damage each round, and continue to do so for as long as a victim remains within the area of the ghelarn's entrapping fluid.

An engulfed creature takes 1d2 points of acid damage each round. Engulf (Ex) As a standard action, a giant clam can attempt to pull a creature up to one size smaller than itself that is within reach into its interior. An opponent can make an attack of opportunity against the clam, but if it does so it is not entitled to a saving throw. An opponent that does not attempt an attack of opportunity must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or be pulled into the clam's interior. An engulfed creature is subject to the clam's acid, and is considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. The save DC is Strength-based. A giant clam can be forced open by making an opposed Strength check against the clam's Strength check. Otherwise, it opens on its own in 1d4 hours. Camouflage (Ex) The rough shell of a giant clam is usually draped with barnacles, anemones, and bits of coral, which help it to blend in with its environment. Creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a giant clam. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (any water- or sea-related skill) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the giant clam.

The giant leech loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 10, but holds on with great tenacity and automatically inflicts bite damage each round. A giant leech has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached giant leech can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the giant leech is removed. Blood Drain (Ex) A giant leech drains blood at the end of each turn it is attached, inflicting 1 point of Strength and Constitution damage. Susceptible to Salt (Ex) A handful of salt burns a giant leech as if it were a flask of acid, causing 1d6 points of damage per use.

False Humanity (Su) During the day, a huecuva is cloaked in an illusion that makes it look, sound, and feel like the living creature it once was. This effect functions similarly to  disguise self-if a creature interacts directly with a huecuva, it can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the illusion. Regardless, the huecuva's scent never changes-it always exudes a faint stench of grave dust and decay. Creatures with the scent ability receive a +4 bonus on any Will saving throw made to see through this illusion. At night (regardless of whether the huecuva itself knows night has fallen) this illusion fades and reveals the creature for what it truly is.

The victim is killed instantly, and becomes a zombie-like creature under the incutilis's control. This zombie isn't treated as being undead, and is immune to spells and effects that affect only undead (including damage from positive energy). The incutilis is attached to this zombie-typically by the head-occupying the same square and moving along with it. The incutilis can make attacks with its tentacles independently of the zombie's slam. It can also retract its tendrils as a move action, but doing so causes the zombie to collapse and revert to a normal corpse. The incutilis must retract its tendrils before it can move away from a zombie it's attached to. Any attack that deals damage to the zombie also deals 1 point of damage to the incutilis, regardless of how much damage is dealt to the zombie. Area-affecting spells affect both the puppeteer and zombie. A character can attempt to attack just the incutilis, but takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Killing the incutilis destroys the zombie.

The reservoir holds enough poison for 3 successful bite attacks, after which the creature merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds and provokes attacks of opportunity.

Its natural form is that of a jackal, but it can also take the form of a human or a human-jackal hybrid. A jackalwere's human form is fixed-it cannot assume different human forms. A jackalwere can use its sleep gaze in any of its forms. In jackal form, it functions as a dog (Bestiary 87). In its hybrid form, a jackalwere can make a bite attack as a secondary attack, while in human form it lacks its bite attack entirely. A jackalwere can shift into any of its three alternate forms as a move action. Equipment does not meld with the new form between human and hybrid forms but does between those forms and its jackal form.  Jackal Empathy (Ex) A jackalwere can communicate and empathize with jackals (use stats for Small dog; see Bestiary 87), and can use Bluff as if it were Diplomacy to change a jackal's attitude, receiving a +4 racial bonus to do so.  Sleep Gaze (Su) Sleep for 3 minutes (a standard action rouses the creature, as does damage), 30 feet, Will DC 12 negates. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw cannot be affected by the same jackalwere's sleep gaze for 24 hours. This is a sleep effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A DC 14 Will save negates the effect. On a failed save, the target is permanently cursed. The victim of the curse takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and checks until the curse is removed. A creature can only be affected by a single jynx at one time. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The water is emptied only if the kappa willingly tips its head or a creature pinning the kappa forces it to do so (requiring a grapple check while pinned). If the water is emptied, the kappa becomes immobile and staggered. It can still take actions, but it cannot move from the spot on its own. If the emptied head bowl is refilled with water, the kappa recovers from this condition immediately. This replacement water doesn't have to be from the kappa's home, but the kappa refills its head bowl from there at its first opportunity.

Doing so causes the flame to become a light similar to that created by a dancing lights spell, under the control of the kijimuna. An attended object can make a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to avoid this effect. Unlike a dancing lights spell, a kijimuna's steal fire ability can cause a stolen fire to strike a creature, either ringing the target in light as per the spell faerie fire for 5 minutes, or dealing 2d6 points of fire damage (DC 13 Reflex, half ). Both save DCs are Charisma-based. A lantern, candle, torch, or similar item that has its flame stolen cannot be relit by any means for 24 hours.

Looking like a whirlwind of dancing firefly lights, the gestalt has all the powers and abilities of a Large air elemental plus the following: archon, good, and lawful subtypes; archon traits (aura of menace DC 16); 2 light rays (2d6); DR 5/evil and magic. The archons can remain in this form for 2d4 rounds. When the gestalt separates back into individual lantern archons, its remaining hit points are divided evenly among them; if it had less than 9 hit points, some of the component archons die when the gestalt ends. Light Ray (Ex) A lantern archon can fire beams of light to damage foes. These light rays have a maximum range of 30 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.

All creatures in this area take 1d4 points of holy damage, plus 1 point for each step their alignment deviates from chaotic good. For example, a chaotic neutral or neutral good creature would take 1d4+1 points of damage, a neutral creature would take 1d4+2 points of damage, and a lawful evil creature would take 1d4+4 points of damage. A DC 12 Reflex save negates this damage. Chaotic good creatures are unaffected by this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Traveler's Friend (Su) The performances and company of a lyrakien ease the burden of travel. Once per day, a creature may spend a minute listening to a lyrakien's performance- doing so removes the effects of exhaustion and fatigue from the listener.

All creatures (other than marble snakes) with the area must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become entranced.  This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same marble snake's whistle for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  An entranced victim walks toward the marble snake, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, that creature gets a second saving throw. The effect continues for as long as the marble snake whistles and for 1 round thereafter. An entranced victim is effectively dazed (cannot attack, but can defend). If an entranced opponent is attacked, the effect is immediately broken. A bard's countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.																												
Medium Acid Quasi-elemental	2.00	600	Medium	5	18, touch 11, flat-footed 17	22	3	4	3			vulnerability to water	20 ft., swim 80 ft.	slam +4 (1d4+1 plus 1d4 acid)		5 ft.	5 ft.	acid, drench	Str 13, Dex 12, Con 15, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	3	4	14	Tome of Horrors Complete	Acid (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals are living creatures of acid; any melee hit deals acid damage. Creatures hitting an acid quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack. Acid Swimmer (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic nature of their environment on their home plane. Drench (Ex) The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals the quasi-elemental's HD). Fumes (Ex) The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body act as an inhaled poison. Creatures within 5 ft. of an acid quasi-elemental must make succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage each round. This poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves more than 5 ft. away from the acid quasielemental. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by water. An acid quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasielemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasielemental within its area of effect. Damage from waterbased attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasielemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental.																												
Medium Negative Energy Elemental	2.00	1200	Medium	9	19, touch 16, flat-footed 13	30	3	9	4				fly 60 ft.

Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals. Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals. Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

A creature caught in the area can make a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics for each elemental's death throes. Molten Glass (Ex) A successful hit against an obsidian quasi-elemental with a piercing or slashing weapon (or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage equal to its current HD opens a wound that spurts molten glass. The wound bleeds for 1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a Reflex save or take fire damage from the splash. A new save must be made each round the wound bleeds and a creature is within the area. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.

Living creatures within range take damage (damage is detailed with each elemental) each round they remain in the area. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. This effect is especially devastating to plants, animals, and aquatic creatures, which take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Earth Mastery (Ex) A salt elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)  Salt Poisoning (Ex) Anyone hit by a salt elemental's claw attack is sickened for 3 rounds + 1 round per Hit Dice of the salt elemental. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A salt elemental submerged in water that covers at least half its body takes 1d6 points of damage each round until it escapes. Damage from water-based attacks (such as the slam attack of a water elemental) deal +50% damage to a salt elemental.

A moon spider's web attack is a ranged touch attack with a +6 racial bonus to the save DC needed to burst or escape the web. The spider also holds a trailing tether that prevents an entangled creature from moving away from the spider until it gets free.  Moon spiders frequently set web traps throughout areas where  they live. Anyone who enters a square of moon spider web must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 13) or become entangled as though it had been hit by a web attack (though the spider doesn't have a tether to it). If a creature that is already entangled enters a square of moon spider web, it must save again or become grappled. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A moon spider's webs have 10 hit points and DR 5/ slashing. A web that's set on fire takes an additional 1d6 points of fire damage each round until it's destroyed.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds; effect 1d3 Str; cure 1 save.																												
Morlock	2.00	600	Medium	8	15, touch 14, flat-footed 11	22	3	9	5			light blindness	40 ft., climb 30 ft.	club +5 (1d6+2), bite +0 (1d4+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	leap attack, sneak attack +1d6, swarming	Str 14, Dex 19, Con 15, Int 5, Wis 14, Cha 6	3	5	19	PFRPG Bestiary	Expert Climber (Ex) A morlock can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface has hand- and footholds. In effect, a morlock is treated as constantly being under a nonmagical version of the spell spider climb, save that it cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the normal +8 racial bonus to Climb checks normally afforded creatures with a climb speed to a +16 racial bonus.  Leap Attack (Ex) As a standard action, a morlock may make a single attack during a jump. It can make this attack at any point along the course of the leap-the start, the end, or while in mid-air. While jumping, a morlock does not provoke attacks of opportunity for leaving a threatened square.  Swarming (Ex) Morlocks dwell and fight in cramped quarters every day of their lives, and as such are quite adept at swarming foes. Up to two morlocks can share the same square at the same time. If two morlocks in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.																												
Mudman	2.00	600	Medium	0	12, touch 10, flat-footed 12	15	5	0	3			magic	10 ft.	slam +4 (1d4+3)	touch +3 (mud bomb)	5 ft.	5 ft.	engulf, mud bomb	Str 14, Dex 10, Con 14, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 1	2	+4 (+8 grapple when engulfing)	14	Tome of Horrors Complete	Engulf (Su) Once per minute as a standard action, a mudman can hurl itself at any creature of its size or smaller within 10 feet. If it succeeds on a ranged touch attack, the mudman immediately makes a CMB check to grapple the target (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) with a +4 racial bonus. If the mudman fails to establish a hold, it drops into an adjacent square and is staggered for 1 round.  If the mudman establishes a hold, it flows over its opponent, covering the creature with its muddy body-it can attempt a new CMB check to maintain the "hold" on the creature each round that follows as a free action. The creature is effectively blinded and must either hold its breath or suffocate as long as the mudman retains its hold. Each round the mudman maintains its hold, it deals 1d4+3 points of damage as it crushes and constricts its victims.  Magic Vulnerability (Ex) Mudmen are particularly susceptible to dispel magic, as this spell disrupts the magical energies in their bodies. A mudman subjected to dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude save for half damage). Transmute mud to rock deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any mudmen caught in the area of effect and leaves them staggered until they can find a new mud pool. Other, similar spells may have similar effects.  Mud Bomb (Su) A mudman can hurl globs of its muddy body mixed with its surrounding mud-this attack has a range increment of 10 feet. If one of these mud bombs hits a target, it quickly grows semi-solid and tenacious, causing 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. If the cumulative Dexterity damage from mud bombs ever equals the target's actual Dexterity score, the target remains conscious but is held immobile and cannot take any physical action (although see below) until the mud is removed or the target breaks free. Spell-like abilities or spells with only verbal components may be used if the trapped creature can make a DC 20 concentration check. It's a DC 20 Strength check (made as a full-round action) to pry accumulated mud off and remove all Dexterity damage caused by the attack-a creature that is held immobile can break free with a DC 25 Strength check made as a full-round action (this is the only physical action the creature can attempt while encased in mud). The mud dries and crumbles to dust in 15 minutes, or in 1d3 rounds if a large amount of water (such as results from a casting of create water) is used to wash it away.  Mud Pool (Su) A mudman cannot leave the bounds of the mud pool it dwells in, although these mud pools may be of any size. A mudman's tremorsense extends throughout the entire mud pool, and it gains a +16 bonus on Stealth checks when hiding in a mud pool. A mudman forced out of its mud pool is staggered.																												
Mummified Crocodile	2.00	600	Large	1	14, touch 10, flat-footed 13	19	5	4	2				20 ft., swim 30 ft.	bite +5 (1d8+4 plus grab), tail slap +0 (1d12+2)		10 ft.	5 ft.	death roll, servant's curse (DC 13)	Str 19, Dex 12, Con -, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 14	2	7	18 (22 vs. trip)	AP 81	Death Roll (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a crocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The crocodile deals its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the crocodile maintains its grapple.  Sprint (Ex) Once per minute a crocodile may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40 feet for 1 round.

Those within 30 feet viewing the dancing snake must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or be dazed for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

All living and undead creatures within a 60-foot spread must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be fascinated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to that nosoi's song for 24 hours. This effect continues for as long as the nosoi sings and for 1 round thereafter. A nosoi can sing for a number or rounds per day equal to twice its Hit Dice. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. This ability can affect undead creatures, even though the undead subtype makes such creatures immune to mind-affecting effects (though undead creatures with immunity to mind-affecting effects from a source other than their creature type are still immune). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Observer Robot	2.00	600	Tiny	2	18, touch 14, flat-footed 16	16	1	5	4	all-around vision, hardness 5		vulnerable to critical hits and electricity	20 ft., fly 60 ft.

(5 ft. with integrated laser torch)	integrated laser torch, integrated stun gun	Str 12, Dex 15, Con -, Int 10, Wis 17, Cha 1	3	3	14 (22 vs. trip)	AP 86	Camouflage (Ex) An observer robot's outer shell contains color-shifting screens that allow the creature to blend into any background. Though not truly invisible, they are hard to pinpoint. While using this ability, an observer robot gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and has concealment from creatures more than 5 feet away.  Integrated Laser Torch (Ex) An observer robot is outfitted with an integrated laser torch used to bypass barriers or restraints. When activated, the torch emits a beam of highly focused light, cutting and burning through surfaces up to 6 inches away. Attacks from a laser torch resolve as touch attacks and deal 1d10 points of fire damage. This damage is not modified further by Strength. An observer robot's integrated laser torch is mounted on an extending arm that allows it greater reach. When the laser torch is used as a tool or as a weapon to sunder, its damage bypasses hardness up to 20 points, and damage is not halved (as is normally the case for energy damage applied to objects) unless the object is particularly fire-resistant. A laser torch's cutting beam passes through force fields and force effects without damaging the field. Invisible objects and creatures can't be harmed by a laser torch.  Integrated Stun Gun (Ex) An observer robot has an integrated stun gun built into its head. This weapon uses a sonic amplifier to produce powerful low-frequency blasts of energy that can pummel targets. This weapon has a range increment of 20 feet, and it deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage. When it scores a critical hit, the robot can attempt a free trip combat maneuver (CMB +13) against the target, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  Transmit Senses (Ex) An observer robot is outfitted with a number of sensors, cameras, and microphones that allow it to record events and transmit them to another location. An observer robot can record up to 12 hours of audio and video. An observer robot's communications can be keyed to a commsetTG or other similar device, and it can broadcast everything it can see or hear to this device as long as it is within 1 mile. The signal strength can be enhanced with a signal boosterTG. An observer robot can also transmit its senses to another observer robot. A signal has difficulty penetrating solid barriers. A signal is blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. Force fields do not block signals. Broadcasting functions like a scrying sensor, allowing the viewer to hear and see what the observer robot is experiencing. The viewer gains the benefits of any nonmagical special abilities the observer robot has tied to its senses (such as low-light vision), but the viewer uses her own Perception skill. This ability doesn't allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it, even if both the observer robot and the viewer possess them.

If the target fails a DC 14 Will save, it either gains a +4 bonus or takes a -4 penalty (ovinnik's choice) on its next three d20 rolls. The target can choose to automatically fail the saving throw, but must choose before it knows whether the touch will be beneficial or harmful. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A panotti can also wrap its ears around the length of its body for warmth and protection from the elements (similar to using a bedroll or heavy blankets), or use them as secondary natural attacks (as per wing attacks).

Str 8, Dex 14, Con 9, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 12	3	1	13 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Emotion Aura (Sp) Each paracletus exists as the embodiment of a specific emotive duality. Three times per day, a paracletus can create an aura representing one of its two programmed emotions. Creatures in the area must make a DC 12 Will save to resist the aura. A creature that makes its save against the aura is unaffected by that aeon's aura for the next 24 hours. The paracletus can choose one creature in the area to ignore its effects. The effect of the aura lasts for 10 minutes, and ends if a creature moves more than 30 feet from the aeon. The aura is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Specific emotive dualities and their powers follow-any single paracletus can only use one of these three dualistic options and cannot change to a different one.  Courage/Fear: The aura acts as bless or bane.  Empathy/Apathy: The aura gives creatures a +2 bonus or a -2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.  Hope/Despair: The aura gives creatures a +2 morale bonus on Will saving throws or a -2 penalty on Will saving throws.

Quills (Ex) Any creature attacking a pilo with natural weapons or an unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. A creature that grapples a pilo takes 2d6 points of piercing damage each round it is engaged in a grapple. A pilo can also use its quills to damage any opponent it successfully bull rushes. Any creature that takes damage from a pilo's quills risks being poisoned.  Roll Up (Ex) As a move action, a pilo can tuck itself into a ball. This grants the pilo a +4 bonus to its natural armor, but its speed is reduced to 10 feet.

This attack uses the plantoid servitor's full attack bonus and deals 1d3+2 damage.  Poison (Ex) Transformative Poison: Bite-injury; save DC 13 Fort; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect special; cure 1 save. On the first failed save, the victim is paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. On the second failed saving throw, moss rapidly grows on all skin surfaces. The victim gets a +2 bonus on the third saving throw, but if the third save fails the victim becomes a plantoid servitor under the control of the nearest plantoid. There is a 25% chance that the victim becomes a new plantoid in a hideous transformation that takes 24 hours. If the victim succeeds on his third saving throw, the moss that grew on him withers and dies and falls away within a few minutes. The save DC is Constiution-based.

Poltergeist	2.00	600	Medium	1	12, touch 12, flat-footed 11	16	2	2	4	incorporeal, natural invisibility, rejuvenation			fly 20 ft.

All creatures within 30 feet when a poltergeist uses this ability must make a DC 14 Will save to avoid becoming frightened for 1d4 rounds. The poltergeist then resumes its invisibility at the end of its turn as a free action. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the fear effect of that poltergeist for 24 hours. If the poltergeist's natural invisibility is negated via other methods, it cannot use this ability. Likewise, those that can see invisible creatures are immune to this special attack. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Rejuvenation (Su) When a poltergeist is destroyed, it only remains destroyed for 2d4 days. After this time, the undead spirit reforms where it was destroyed, fully healed. The only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.  Site Bound (Ex) A poltergeist cannot travel more than 120 feet from the point at which it was created or formed.  Telekinesis (Su) A poltergeist has no method of attacking apart from telekinesis. This ability functions as the spell telekinesis, with a CL equal to the poltergeist's Hit Dice (CL 3rd for most poltergeists). A typical poltergeist has a ranged attack roll of +3 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures, and can use the ability on objects or creatures of up to 75 pounds. If a poltergeist attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 12 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A creature that successfully saves is immune to the fear effect of the same poltergeist for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Natural Invisibility (Su) This ability is constant, allowing a poltergeist to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent, cannot be dispelled or negated, and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.  Rejuvenation (Su) Like ghosts, it's difficult to destroy a poltergeist through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Unlike ghosts, powerful spells such as dispel evil usually are effective. Short of that, however, the only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.  Telekinesis (Su) A poltergeist can create a telekinetic effect to hurl one object or creature within 10 feet to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). This ability functions as the violent thrust version of the telekinesis spell (caster level 10th) with the following exceptions: the poltergeist can hurl only one object or creature per round; the poltergeist uses its Charisma modifier (usually +2) to modify its base attack bonus. A creature targeted by this ability can make a DC 13 Will save to avoid being hurled by the poltergeist. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of a poltergeist at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.

If the rakshasa remains stationary in such a form, it can attempt Stealth checks even while being observed. It can remain motionless in object form indefinitely, but reverts to its true form as soon as it takes any action.  Master's Eyes (Su) A raktavarna can designate a single creature as its master as a standard action. If the raktavarna is a spellcaster's familiar, its master is automatically that spellcaster, and the raktavarna cannot change this. As a full-round action, a raktavarna's master can observe  the world as if looking through the raktavarna's eyes. The master must concentrate to maintain this link each round. The master's visual senses are suppressed for this time, and he uses the raktavarna's darkvision, detect magic, and regular eyesight to observe the world. This ability has no limit on range, and functions even across planar boundaries. If the raktavarna is slain while its master is using this ability, the master is stunned for 1d4 rounds (no save).  Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Wis plus modify memory; cure 1 save. Each time a victim takes Wisdom damage from this poison, a modify memory effect causes the victim to forget the previous minute's interactions with the raktavarna, as long as the raktavarna is no longer visible or is in object form. The save DC is Constitution-based.

It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.  Poison (Ex) Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex and reduce movement speed by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet); cure 1 save. The venom of ravenous urchin swarms stiffens muscles and locks joints into painful configurations. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Underfoot (Ex) Each time a creature moves through a space occupied by a ravenous urchin swarm or starts its movement in such a space, it runs the risk of a ravenous urchin moving underfoot. The creature must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or take 1 point of damage plus poison. Additionally, the affected creature's movement speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a ravenous urchin. Any creature moving at half its speed or slower can pick its way through a tidal pool of ravenous urchins (but not a ravenous urchin swarm) with no trouble. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Str 17, Dex 13, Con -, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 14	2	5	16	AP 86	Absorb Electricity (Ex) When a rust-risen is damaged by electricity, it takes no damage (as if immune). Instead, the rust-risen gains 1 temporary hit point for every 4 points of damage it would have taken. A rust-risen can only have a number of temporary hit points equal to 150% of its hit point total. These temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. If a rust-risen takes more than double its normal hit point total in electricity damage from a single attack, the creature is destroyed.  Augmentations (Ex) Rust-risen have various pieces of malfunctioning machinery embedded in their bodies. Each of these augmentations provides the rust-risen with different abilities. A rust-risen has one augmentation plus one additional augmentation for every 3 Hit Dice the creature possesses (typically 2 for most rust-risen). The rust-risen presented here has the arm drill and metal jaw augmentations. See the next page for other augmentations.  Malfunction (Ex) The machinery embedded in a rust-risen functions unpredictably in stressful situations. When a rust-risen enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that it malfunctions. This chance resets to 0% 1 minute after combat ends. When a rust-risen malfunctions, it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1d4 minutes.

It gains +2 Constitution and +2 Strength, but takes a -2 penalty to its AC. The frenzy lasts as long as the battle or 1 minute, whichever is shorter.

Woodland Stride (Ex) A sasquatch can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Undergrowth that has been magically manipulated to impede movement still affects the sasquatch.

This painful howling affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazed for one round. The save DC is Charisma-based. The effects of multiple screaming devilkin using their scream ability in an overlapping area is not cumulative; only one save need be made each round.  Conversation, even shouting, is inaudible within 60 feet of a screaming devilkin using this ability. Spellcasters in the area must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) each time they try to cast a spell. Silence negates the devilkin's scream for the duration of the spell.

(5 ft. with tail)	stygian breath	Str 9, Dex 20, Con 12, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 16	3	6	15	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Shadow Blend (Su) In conditions of illumination other than bright light, a shadow drake disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). It can resume or suspend this ability as a free action.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a shadow drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.  Stygian Breath (Su) As a standard action, a shadow drake can exhale a ball of black liquid that explodes into a cloud of frigid black mist. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 12 half) to all creatures within a 5-foot-radius spread. The mist snuffs out light sources in the area effect, extinguishing nonmagical light sources and dispelling light spells of 1st level or lower. Once a shadow drake has used its stygian breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Hunt by Scent (Ex) Shadow hunters are expert at tracking prey through the dim warrens where they dwell. They can track using their Perception skill in place of Survival.

Str 14, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 14, Cha 11	2	4	16	AP 25	Feather Fall (Ex) A shadowgarm's body is both light and consists of numerous folds of thin flesh. Although it cannot fly, a falling shadowgarm always descends as if under the effects of a feather fall spell, and thus never takes falling damage. Light Fixation (Su) Although a shadowgarm is not particularly harmed by bright light, it prefers dim lighting. Magical light, on the other hand, causes a shadowgarm to grow slow and lethargic. Whenever a shadowgarm is within an area of bright light that is magically created, it is staggered. Shadow Blend (Su) In conditions of dim light, a shadowgarm's outline wavers and blends with the surrounding shadows, granting it concealment (20% miss chance) even if its opponents are capable of seeing clearly in dim light. Shadow Slime (Su) A shadowgarm is coated with a thin layer of oily black slime. Whenever it strikes a foe, it transfers a swath of this cold black slime onto the creature struck. This slime causes a growing numbness and lethargy in the bodies of those it coats. Each time a creature takes damage from a shadowgarm's claws, the creature struck must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or take a cumulative -2 penalty to its Dexterity score. A creature whose total Dexterity penalty equals its Dexterity score is paralyzed and blinded as long as the penalty remains in effect. All accrued Dexterity penalties fade an hour after the last time the victim was affected by shadow slime, but any new shadow slime resets the recovery period. Exposure to bright light of any sort causes the Dexterity penalty to lessen by 2 points per round until all of the shadow slime is effectively "burned away" by the light. A shadowgarm is immune to the effects of its shadow slime and the shadow slime of other shadowgarms. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Although a shikigami  is Tiny, it never provokes attacks of opportunity when it attacks an adjacent foe with a melee weapon. If a shikigami critically hits an opponent with an improvised weapon, it deals x3 damage. A shikigami is proficient with improvised weapons.

Shock (Su) Shocker lizards can deliver an electrical shock to a single opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 1d8 points of nonlethal electricity damage to living opponents (Reflex DC 12 half ). This save DC is Constitution-based. Additionally, if two or more shocker lizards are within 20 feet of each other, they can work together to create a lethal shock once every 1d4 rounds. This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered on any one contributing lizard. All creatures within that radius take 2d8 points of lethal electricity damage for each lizard contributing to the shock, to a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save (DC 10 + the number of lizards contributing) halves the damage.																												
Shredskin	2.00	600	Small	2	14, touch 13, flat-footed 12	22	2	3	4	amorphous			fly 40 ft.

When wrapping a host body in this way, the shredskin gains Strength 14 or the host body's Strength, whichever is higher, but cannot use its grab or enshroud abilities which doing so. Attacks targeted at the shredskin deal half damage to it and half damage to the host body; area attacks deal normal damage to both the shredskin and its host. If the host is destroyed, the shredskin unwraps itself as a free action on its next turn. A typical Medium corpse has 15 hit points for this purpose, while a Small corpse has 10 hit points. A shredskin can only use this ability on a generally humanoid-shaped creature (two arms, one head, humanoid torso) of Medium or Small size.  Enshroud (Ex) A shredskin that successfully pins a creature can wrap itself around that target like a shirt. The target gains the pinned condition, but the shredskin has neither the grappled or pinned condition, and can move itself and the target as if it controlled the target's body. The shredskin deals constrict damage to the target on its turn each round (no combat maneuver check needed). Attacking the shredskin while it's using this ability damages both it and the target as described in the control body ability. The shredskin can release the target as a free action.

Once per day as a standard action, it can also grant this bonus to one ally within 30 feet for 10 minutes.  Heroic Strength (Su) Once per day, a silvanshee can grant itself a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 minute.  Spectral Mist (Su) A silvanshee can assume an eerie, mist-like form roughly the size and shape of a cat. This ability has the same effect as a gaseous form spell, except the silvanshee retains its own DR and supernatural abilities and can move at its normal speed. It can remain in mist form up to 5 minutes per day. This duration does not have to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

Creatures that succeed at a DC 13 Will save resist the effects of this aura, though they must attempt a new saving throw each time they use one of the listed skills in the area.

Sin-Scent (Su) Sinspawn have scent against creatures whose nature reflects the sinspawn's sin. For example, wrathful sinspawn can scent creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular sinspawn can scent.  Sinful Bite (Su) A creature bitten by a sinspawn is overwhelmed with sinful thoughts (DC 12 Will save negates). These emotions are so powerful that the target becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes. An affected target that is bitten a second time is staggered for 1 round if it fails its saving throw.

Str 12, Dex 16, Con -, Int 6, Wis 15, Cha 15	3	4	17	Tome of Horrors 4	Flesh Consumption (Ex) A skin feaster that successfully deals Constitution damage to a living humanoid creature must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or spend its next turn devouring the flesh that has fallen from that opponent. It takes no other actions during this time but can defend itself normally. It consumes an amount of flesh equal to 3 points of Constitution damage (or drain) each round.  Necrotic Touch (Su) The touch of a skin feaster deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage if the target fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. If the save fails by 5 or more, 1 point is actually Constitution drain instead. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Skin Regrowth (Su) If a skin feaster manages to consume an amount of flesh equal to 6 points of Constitution damage in any 24-hour period, it begins to regrow its skin. The process requires 1d6 hours and for the next 1d3 days thereafter, the skin feaster appears just as it did before its death. During this time, the skin feaster loses its flesh consumption weakness and appears human (though it is still undead). Once this period ends, the skin feaster's skin sloughs off, restoring it to its original appearance.																												
Skin Stealer	2.00	600	Medium	3	15, touch 13, flat-footed 12	18	2	7	4				30 ft.	2 claws +5 (1d4+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	sneak attack (+1d6), steal skin	Str 12, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 16, Wis 10, Cha 17	2	3	16	AP 44	Steal Skin (Su) As a full-round action, a skin stealer may steal the skin of a creature of Small, Medium, or Large size with a roughly humanoid shape. The target creature must be dead, helpless, or willing. If the target creature is alive, the skin stealer must make a successful coup de grace attack to steal its skin. The skin stealer can don or remove a stolen skin as a move action. When wearing a stolen skin, the skin stealer takes on the likeness of the skin's original owner, including the victim's voice, build, and size, but gains none of the creature's abilities. The stolen skin grants the skin stealer a +10 bonus on Disguise checks, with none of the usual penalties for different gender, race, age, and size. Stolen skins are preserved and remain as supple as living skin. A skin stealer may only steal and use a number of skins equal to its Charisma score. The skin stealer may choose to discard unwanted skins to make room for new ones at any time; discarded skins rot and decay normally.

Once per minute, a slurk may wallow on a solid surface as a full-round action to coat the floor in a 5-foot radius with this grease. The smear created turns that area of floor into difficult terrain for 10 minutes, after which the grease dries to a nasty crust.  Hunker (Ex) The slurk gains a +4 bonus to its CMD to avoid bull rush or overrun attempts.  Slime (Ex) A slurk's back is crusted with thick, dry slime and dozens of nodules. As a standard action at will, a slurk can squirt a jet of this slime from one of these nodules as a ranged touch attack against any target within 30 feet. The slime quickly hardens to the texture of cold tar, entangling the foe. Anyone the slurk successfully bull rushes or overruns is automatically squirted with back slime. The hardened slime can be removed as a full-round action with a DC 15 Strength check. The slurk's back slime grants a creature riding it a +8 bonus on Ride checks made to stay in the saddle, but a -8 penalty on Ride checks to dismount.																												
Small Negative Energy Elemental	2.00	600	Small	7	18, touch 15, flat-footed 14	13	1	6	3				fly 60 ft.

Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals. Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals. Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

Creatures viewing this burst must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. See the table below for the save DC for each positive energy elemental's blinding flash. The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Throes (Su) A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura). Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's positive energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's positive energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. All creatures in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC as the elemental's positive energy save DC) or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Positive Energy (Ex) A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with positive energy. This deals extra damage to an undead or negative energy based target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) by the same amount. Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of positive energy.

Creatures caught in the smoke must succeed on a Fortitude save or be nauseated as they choke and cough. A creature that chokes for 3 or more consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 2 HD of the smoke dragon.  Smoke Form (Ex) Once per day, a smoke dragon can assume a smoky form as a move action. It can spend up to 1 minute per day per HD in smoke form. This time does not have to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. A smoke form dragon can fly at a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).

Str 7, Dex 14, Con -, Int 11, Wis 10, Cha 9	3	3	11	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Alignment Variation (Ex) Soulbound dolls are at least partially neutral in alignment, although they can also be chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. They have an alignment-dependent spell-like ability usable once per day as listed below.  • Chaotic Neutral: rage  • Lawful Neutral: suggestion (DC 12)  • Neutral: deep slumber (DC 12)  • Neutral Evil: inflict serious wounds (DC 12)  • Neutral Good: heroism  Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) The weakened conviction of a soulbound doll's soul makes it susceptible to mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that it is a construct.  Soul Focus (Su) The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll or its apparel, typically one of the doll's eyes or a gem embedded into its neck or chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another doll, using the same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn, and so if later it is put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality and memories from its previous body or bodies. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Mirror Travel (Su) At will as a standard action, a soulsliver can crawl into any mirror as if it were a door or window, instantly transporting itself to another mirror within 500 feet as if using dimension door (caster level 7th). It can remain within that mirror indefinitely, or on its next turn crawl out or use this ability again. Its compression ability allows it to enter or exit Diminutive or larger mirrors. It can only exit a mirror if it is using change shape to take a specific creature's form.  Perfect Copy (Su) When a soulsliver uses change shape, it can assume the appearance of a specific individual. However, it is always the mirror image of the person it copies, which might give away that something is wrong.

While worn in this way, the wearer can see through the oni's eyes and speak through its mouth, although the wearer retains its own senses and voice. The spirit oni remains a separate creature, and must detach from its host's face (as a move action) if it wishes to take any action of its own (including attacking or using a spell-like ability). While a spirit oni is worn as a mask, it grants a +2 insight bonus on its host's Perception checks.

Creatures adjacent to the spore rat must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. The cloud lasts a single round.  The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spores (Ex) The bite of a spore rat injects a living creature with miniscule spores that cause nausea for 1 round. A successful DC 11 Fortitude save negates the nausea.

Within 30 feet of a t'shann, all opponents with an Intelligence score greater than 5 must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as if by a confusion spell (caster level equal to the t'shann's HD). If the opponent approaches to within 10 feet he must succeed on another DC 13 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage for as long as he remains within 10 feet of the t'shann. Once the opponent moves more than 10 feet from this effect, his Intelligence score immediately returns to normal, although any confusion effects remain until he moves more than 30 feet away. Psionic monsters and creatures, being attuned to the brainwaves of others, suffer these effects at double the normal range. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Burrow (Ex) A t'shann rarely appears in the open air, preferring the closeness and coolness of being deep in the earth. In order to attack a t'shann physically, an opponent must first find it and lure it out of its burrow. Finding a t'shann burrow requires a successful DC 15 Perception check.  Once the burrow is located, the t'shann can be lured out by placing small pile of gems at the entrance. The t'shann must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or shuffle out of its lair to consume the treats.  Spew (Ex) If attacked, a t'shann emits a spray of powerful acids from nearly every pore on its body, affecting any creature within 10 feet of it. This acidic spray deals 1d4 points of acid damage, plus 1 point of damage per round for 1d4 rounds. A DC 13 Reflex save reduces the acid damage by half. The save DC is Constitution based.

While grappling, instead of making a bite or rake attack, a tatzlwyrm can breathe poison into its victim's face. A tatzlwyrm must begin its turn grappling to use this ability-it can't begin a grapple and use its poison gasp in the same turn.  Tatzlwyrm poison: Breath-inhaled; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d2 Str damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

As such, most wear heavy cloaks or otherwise obscure their countenances. All thawns within 30 feet of an uncloaked thawn must make a DC 15 Will save or be sickened for 1 round. This repulsion is all the more severe when a thawn sees its own reflection. Should a thawn be confronted with its own reflection (such as being presented with a mirror) it must make a DC 15 Will save or be sickened for 1d4+1 rounds.																												
Thoqqua	2.00	600	Medium	1	15, touch 11, flat-footed 14	22	5	4	7			vulnerable to cold	30 ft., burrow 20 ft.	slam +4 (1d6+1 plus burn)		5 ft.	5 ft.	burn (1d6, DC 13)	Str 13, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 10	3	13	23 (25 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Molten Body (Su) A thoqqua's body is hot enough to melt stone. Anyone striking a thoqqua with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a thoqqua or is grappled by one takes 3d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists. A creature that strikes a thoqqua with a manufactured weapon can attempt a DC 13 Reflex save to pull the weapon away from the creature's molten body quickly enough to avoid having the weapon take 1d6 points of fire damage-damage caused to a weapon in this manner is not halved as is normal for damage caused to items, and ignores the first 5 points of hardness possessed by the item. As a result, most metal weapons can generally safely strike a thoqqua without taking much damage, but wooden weapons have a significant chance of burning away if used against one of these creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Thought Eater	2.00	600	Small	8	17, touch 15, flat-footed 13	13	1	5	8	ethereal jaunt, spell absorption	13		40 ft.	touch +7 (1d2+1 plus eat thoughts)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 12, Dex 18, Con 11, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 14	2	19	32 (36 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Detect Magic (Sp) A thought eater can use its detect magic spell-like ability to detect magic-using creatures. Magic-using creatures are defined as creatures with levels in a spellcasting class or creatures with spell-like abilities or the ability to cast spells.  Eat Thoughts (Su) The touch of a thought eater deals 1d2 points of Intelligence damage. A thought eater is sated  when it has consumed at least 12 points of Intelligence in a given 24-hour period.  Ethereal Jaunt (Su) A thought eater can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action, and then shift back again as a free action. This ability is otherwise identical to the ethereal jaunt spell (CL 10th).  Precognition (Su) As a standard action, a thought eater can concentrate and glimpse fragments of potential future events-what it sees probably happens if no action is taken to change it. The vision, however, is incomplete, and makes no sense until the events begin to unfold. On its next action, a thought eater gains a +2 insight bonus on a single attack roll, damage roll, saving throw, or skill check. The bonus can be applied to the roll after the results of the dice are known.  Spell Absorption (Su) If a thought eater's spell resistance protects it form a magical effect, the creature absorbs that magical energy into its body. Absorbing a spells heals a thought eater a number of hit points equal to the absorbed spell's level. This cannot increase a thought eater's hit points above its normal maximum hit points.

This sap does 1d6 points of acid damage per round to flesh until it is washed or scraped off. Camouflage (Ex) Since a tri-flower frond looks like a normal flowering plant when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant. Fluid Drain (Ex) Against a sleeping or helpless foe, a tri-flower frond can release a needle-sharp tendril from its red bloom that pierces its target and drains its body fluids. This deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round, and the victim is considered grappled. Sleep Pollen (Ex) A creature struck by one of the tri-flower frond's tendrils must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall into a deep, coma-like slumber from which it cannot be awakened that lasts for 1-4 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Resistances and immunities to poison apply against the pollen, but resistances or immunities to sleep effects do not. A slumbering victim can also be awakened by a successful DC 20 Heal check after one minute of treatment. A creature that falls victim to the sleep pollen is subject to the tri-flower frond's acid and fluid drain attacks, both as free actions.

Most take the form of gnomes or human children.  Elusive (Su) The tripurasura and items it carries are considered to be under the effects of a nondetection spell. A caster must succeed at a DC 14 caster level check to overcome this effect.  Poison (Ex) Tongue-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Wis damage; cure 1 save.

Str 16, Dex 12, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 7	2	9	20 (24 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Mutation (Ex) The regenerative ability of a troblin does not function as well as those of its trollish parent. Sometimes when an injured troblin regenerates, its body warps in an inexplicable fashion. A severed arm may regrow as two arms, or a scar may grow to cover the troblin's entire body in thick skin. Further, if a troblin suffers a critical hit in melee, it has a 25% chance of gaining a mutation once it is fully healed. See the sidebar for random mutations. Troblin Mutations Each troblin has the potential to possess 1d2 random mutations brought about by its bizarre regeneration. Roll on the table below for each mutation. d20 Mutation 1-2 Dual forearm; claw damage increased by one die type (claw damage 1d6+3) and it gains the benefits of wielding a twohanded weapon with that arm. 3-4 Dual foreleg; +2 racial bonus to Acrobatics checks, +2 racial bonus on CMD to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on solid ground. 5-6 Massive scarring; natural armor bonus increases by +1. 7 Multiple muscles; +2 Strength. 8 Shortened tendons; +2 Dexterity. 9 Redundant vital organs; +2 Constitution. 10 Third leg; +4 racial bonus to Acrobatics checks, +4 racial bonus on CMD to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on solid ground, +10 to Speed. 11 Two arms on one side; gains an additional claw attack when making a full attack and gains the benefits of wielding a twohanded weapon with that arm. 12 Two heads; Gains Superior Two-Weapon Fighting ability (see below) and a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. 13-20 No mutation. Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex) Troblins with two heads automatically gain this ability. Because each of its two heads controls an arm, a troblin does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.

Grabbing Appendages (Ex) A trox's smaller arms are useful for little more than aiding grappling. Trox gain Improved Grapple as a bonus feat, and can maintain a grapple and still make attacks with their main arms.																												
Tsaalgrend	2.00	600	Small	2	14, touch 13, flat-footed 12	19	5	3	4			light blindness, vulnerable to fire	10 ft., climb 10 ft., fly 40 ft.

Spores (Ex) As a standard action, a tsaalgrend can release a cloud of toxic spores in a 10-foot-radius spread. Each living creature within this area must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become paralyzed with fear as the victim vividly hallucinates for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the same tsaalgrend's spores for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Tsathar	2.00	600	Medium	6	18, touch 12, flat-footed 16	13	1	5	5	slimy		light blindness	30 ft., swim 30 ft.	shortspear +3 (1d6+1) or kukri +3 (1d4+1/18-20) or 2 claws +3 (1d6+1), and bite +3 (1d4+1)	shortspear +4 (1d6+1) or net +4 touch (entangled)	5 ft.	5 ft.	leap, summon hydrodaemon	Str 13, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 10	2	6	18 (30 vs. grapple)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Implant (Ex) Tsathar are sexless, reproducing by injecting eggs into living hosts. An egg can be implanted only into a helpless host creature. The host must be of Small size or larger. Giant frogs, bred for this very purpose, are the most common host. Implanting an egg requires one minute to perform. Accompanying the egg is an anaesthetizing poison that causes the host to fall unconscious for the two-week gestation period of the egg unless the host succeeds on a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw; this save DC includes a +8 racial bonus. If the save succeeds, the host remains conscious, but is violently ill (-10 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks) 24 hours before the eggs hatch. When the eggs mature, the young tsathar emerges from the host, killing it in the process. A remove disease spell rids the victim any implanted eggs. A DC 20 Heal check can be attempted to surgically extract an egg from a host. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d6 points of damage to the patient. Leap (Ex) Tsathar are incredible jumpers, able to leap up to 30 feet horizontally or 10 feet vertically. They have a +14 racial bonus on horizontal jumps, or +24 on vertical jumps, and they do not need to make a 10-foot minimum running start before jumping to avoid doubling the jumping DCs. Tsathar can always take 10 when making an Acrobatics check to jump. When a tsathar begins its round by jumping next to an opponent it can make a full attack in the same round. A tsathar wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load cannot use this ability. Summon Hydrodaemon (Sp) A tsathar with at least five levels of cleric can, once per day, attempt to summon a hydrodaemon (q.v.) with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell. Slimy (Ex) Because tsathar continuously cover themselves with muck and slime, they are difficult to grapple. Webs, magic or otherwise, do not affect tsathar, and they usually can wriggle free from most other forms of confinement. This grants them a +12 racial bonus to their CMD to escape grapples, and to their Escape Artist checks.

Due to this division of personalities, there is a 15% chance in any given situation (usually once per encounter) that the heads get into an argument. An ubue engaged in an argument with itself takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, Reflex saves, and to AC for the duration of the encounter, or until they can reach some sort of accord. In a non-combat situation, an opponent can coerce an ubue into a self-argument by making a Charisma check opposed by the ubue's Wisdom check. If the ubue wins the opposed check, the character cannot attempt to coerce that ubue again for one day. Superior Multiweapon Fighting (Ex) An ubue fights with a club in each of its three hands. Because each of its three heads controls an arm, the ubue does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with three weapons.

A kissed opponent must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or begin a terrible transformation that changes the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the transformation). First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim's hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours thereafter, when the victim's head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation's progress is paused by sunlight or any light spell of 3rd level or higher, but stopping the transformation requires remove disease or a similar effect. The transformation is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus. Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency once; effect damage caused by bite can only be healed with magic if the spellcaster succeeds on a DC 20 caster level check; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based. Shriek (Su) Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended mouth to shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same vargouille's shriek for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

An attached volt is effectively grappling its prey. The volt loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A volt has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached volt can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the volt is removed.  Shock (Su) A volt delivers an electrical charge when it hits with its tail slap, dealing 2d4 points of nonlethal damage.  An attached volt can attack the grappled opponent with its tail slap with a +4 bonus in the same round.

Wail (Su) As a standard action, a water leaper can unleash a high-pitched wail that causes living creatures within 60 feet that hear it to make a DC 14 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save succeeds, that creature cannot be affected again by that water leaper's wail for one day. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use either of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.  Dig In (Ex) A weedwhip can bury its central bulb in earth or sand as a move action, granting it partial cover against all attacks (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 196), but preventing it from moving. It can extract itself from the ground as a move action.  Languid Whips (Ex) A weedwhip's tentacles don't threaten any squares, and doesn't make attacks of opportunity.  Poison (Ex) Tentacle-contact; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect nauseated 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poisonous (Ex) Any creature that attacks a weedwhip with a natural piercing or slashing weapon is exposed to its poison.

Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)  A gray dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.  • Young-fog cloud;  • Juvenile-create water;  • Old-control winds;  • Ancient-control water;  Water Breathing (Ex) A gray dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.

A xacon that touches a wooden or earthen item (including the ground), increases its natural armor bonus to +5 (granting the xacon AC 17, touch 12, flat-footed 15). If the xacon touches a metal or stone item, its natural armor bonus increases to +8 (granting the xacon AC 20, touch 12, flat-footed 18). This bonus to its natural armor lasts for 1 minute. After using this ability, the xacon must wait 1d4 rounds before it uses it again.  Tree Meld (Su) Once per day, a xacon can meld its body and possessions into a tree. This ability functions similar to a meld into stone spell with no duration.

This attack inflicts 1d4 points of Intelligence damage per round. When a creature is reduced to 0 Intelligence, it dies, and the tendrils break off inside its brain. One hour later, the creature animates as a yellow musk zombie (see below). Pollen Spray (Ex) As a standard action, a yellow musk creeper can spray a cloud of pollen at a single creature within 30 feet. It must make a +4 ranged touch attack to strike the target, who must then succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be entranced for 1d6 rounds. An entranced creature can take no action other than to move at its normal speed into a space within the yellow musk creeper's reach, at which point an entranced creature remains motionless and allows the creeper to insert tendrils into its brain. The save DC is Constitution-based.

If the yellow musk creeper is slain before the yellow musk zombie rises, the transformation can be prevented by the casting of neutralize poison followed by a heal or restoration spell. Intelligence Damage (Ex) As a free action, a yellow musk creeper can insert hundreds of tiny roots into the head of an entranced foe within any space occupied by the creeper. An entranced foe does not resist this attack and does not receive a saving throw to break free of its entranced state. This attack deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage each round. A victim reduced to Intelligence 0 becomes a yellow musk zombie in 1 hour (see Appendix B). Pollen Spray (Ex) A yellow musk creeper can spray a tiny cloud of hypnotic pollen at a single creature within 30 feet. An opponent hit by the cloud must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be entranced for 1d4 minutes (as by a charm monster spell). Entranced creatures can take no action other than to move at their normal speed into a space occupied by the yellow musk creeper. An entranced creature resists any attempt to halt its progress. A victim within a space occupied by the yellow musk creeper stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The save DC is Constitution-based. Rejuvenation (Ex) A yellow musk creeper can be killed only if its root is dug up, then burned, hacked apart, or otherwise destroyed. Reducing the creeper to 0 or less hit points puts it out of commission, allowing excavation of its roots. The main root is a Small object with a hardness of 3 and 10 hit points. The root can be affected by spells or effects that affect an area or targeted by spells that affect an individual target. As long as the root remains intact, a yellow musk creeper regrows in about 2 weeks.

A creature that makes its save cannot be affected again by the same yhakkor's putrid stench for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Undead Immunities (Ex) Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms); immunity to bleed, death effects, disease, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning; not subject to nonlethal damage, ability drain, or energy drain.

In addition, they gain a +5 racial bonus on Strength checks made to break or destroy objects.  Hatred of Mirrors (Ex) An abrikandilu loathes the sight of its own reflection. Using a mirror grants a +5 bonus on Intimidate checks against an abrikandilu. An abrikandilu adjacent to a mirror or attacked by a mirror-carrying creature (at the GM's discretion, some shields could be considered mirrors) must attempt a DC 15 Will save at the start of its turn. If it fails, it must focus all of its actions that round on attempts to destroy the mirror.  Mutilation (Su) An abrikandilu's bite causes hideous, ugly wounds that not only mar beauty but supernaturally diminish a creature's sense of self-worth. A creature bitten by an abrikandilu must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or gain a -1 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. This penalty can stack as high as a -5 penalty with multiple bites and failed saves, and lasts even after the wounds are healed. The penalty reduces by 1 point every 24 hours. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

By remaining in contact with a willing creature, it can replay up to 24 hours of witnessed events, or shorter incidents if it so chooses. It takes a zebub 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images, which the target receives in a flash of information, without sound or other sensory information. After relaying its findings, the zebub cannot replay its visions of those events again. A zebub cannot replay its visions for an unwilling creature or as an attack, no matter how horrific the events it might have witnessed.																												
Adamantine Cobra	3.00	800	Small	2	25, touch 13, flat-footed 24	20	0	2	0		13		40 ft.	bite +3 (1d6+1 plus poison)		5 ft.	5 ft.

The creator must have seen or be holding an item from the specified creature for this order to function.  Poison (Ex)An adamantine cobra's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its body. Because it is a construct, the cobra does not naturally produce this poison, and its creator must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir holds enough poison for 3 successful bite attacks, after which the creature merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir with any injury poison (typically black adder venom), though acid, alchemical substances, and even stranger liquids have been used.  Black Adder Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 11; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save.

Nettlefin Toxin: Spear-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/minute for 4 minutes; effect paralyzed for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Poison Use (Ex) Adaros are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves.  Rain Frenzy (Su) Adaros revere storms, and their lust for blood is amplified exponentially while it is raining. While fighting in the rain or during other stormy weather, adaros act as though affected by the rage spell. An adaro gains this benefit even if it is underwater, but only as long as it remains within a move action away from the water's surface (50 feet for most adaros).  Speak with Sharks (Su) An adaro can communicate telepathically with sharks to a distance of 100 feet. This communication is limited to simple concepts, such as "come," "defend," or "attack."

The adherer automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot break free while the adherer is alive without removing the adhesive first.  A weapon that strikes an adherer is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 14 Reflex save. A successful DC 14 Strength check is needed to pry it off. The save and check DC are both Constitution-based.

A creature adjacent to the adherer can attempt to pry off a stuck weapon with a DC 17 Strength check, but doing so provokes an attack of opportunity from the adherer. The adherer's adhesive flesh gives it a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks. It can attempt to grapple a foe without spending an action whenever a creature successfully hits it with a natural attack or an unarmed strike.  An adherer does not gain the grappled condition when it grapples a foe, nor does it provoke attacks of opportunity when it attempts to do so. Fire can temporarily burn away an adherer's adhesive coating-whenever an adherer takes at least 10 points of fire damage, it loses its adhesive special quality for 1d4 rounds. Universal solvent, alchemical solvent, or a similar fluid removes an adherer's adhesive quality for 1 hour if it fails a DC 15 Reflex save, or for 1d4 rounds if it makes the save. The adherer's skin loses its adhesive quality 1 hour after the adherer dies. An adherer can release anything stuck to it as a free action. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be fascinated for 2d4 rounds. While a target is fascinated, the allip can approach it without breaking the effect, but an attack by the allip does end the effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip's babble for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Madness (Su) Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic effect makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.  Touch of Insanity (Su) The touch of an allip deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (DC 15 Will negates). A successful critical hit causes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and 1 point of Wisdom drain (instead of double Wisdom damage). With each successful attack, an allip gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A medium animated object has 2 CP; differently sized objects have CP totals as detailed on the size chart on this page. If an animated object spends more CP than its size category would allow, its CR increases by 1 (minimum of +1) for every 2 additional CP spent. Additional Attack (Ex, 1 CP): Gains an additional slam attack. Additional Movement (Ex, 1 CP): Gains a new mode of movement (burrow, climb, fly [clumsy], or swim) at a speed equal to its base speed. Constrict (Ex, 1 CP): Gains constrict with its slam attacks (the object must have grab before it can take this ability). Faster (Ex, 1 CP): One of the object's movement modes increases by +10 ft. Grab (Ex, 1 CP): Gains grab special attack with slam attacks. Metal (Ex, 2 CP): The object is made of common metal. Its hardness increases to 10, and it gains a +2 increase to its natural armor bonus. Mithral objects cost 4 CP, and gain hardness 15 plus a +4 increase to natural armor. Adamantine objects cost 6 CP, gain hardness 20, and receive a +6 increase to natural armor. Stone (Ex, 1 CP): The object is made of stone or crystal. Its hardness increases to 8 and it gains a +1 increase to its natural armor bonus. Trample (Ex, 2 CP): The object gains the trample special attack (see page 305 for damage and save DC).

Creatures struck by this acid take 4d4 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 14 halves). Once an ankheg uses this attack, it must wait 6 hours before using it again. Additionally, during this time period, its bite attack does not inflict any additional acid damage.  As a result, an ankheg does not use this ability unless it is desperate or frustrated, most often spitting acid when reduced to fewer than half its full normal hit points or when it cannot not successfully grab an opponent. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use either of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.  Entangle (Su) An assassin vine can, as a free action, cause plants within 30 feet of it to animate and grasp at foes. This ability is otherwise similar to entangle (CL 4th, DC 13).

An affected creature can attempt a DC 14 Will save to resist the effects. If the save fails, the opponent acts as if affected by a charm person spell (caster level equals the baccae's HD). A baccae can suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Rage (Su) Once per day, a baccae in beast form can fly into berserk frenzy. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds).  In this rage, she gains temporary bonuses to her ability scores: +4 Strength, +4 Constitution.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  A creature that fails its save is partially blinded and overcome with fits of sneezing. Both effects last 1d6+2 rounds. An affected creature takes a -1 penalty to AC, loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks and on Strength- and Dexterity-based skills and checks.

Str 19, Dex 10, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 4	3	7	17	Belkzen Hold Of The Orc Hordes	Spines (Ex) Targets of a bristle boar's successful gore attack must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw to avoid being speared by the dangerously sharp spines around its head and neck. Failure results in 1d4 points of piercing damage as well as 1 point of bleed damage per round for  3 rounds. Bleed damage from multiple spines doesn't stack, but the duration is reset by subsequent attacks. Magical healing or a successful DC 15 Heal check ends the bleed effect. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Bronze Sentinel	3.00	800	Small	7	18, touch 14, flat-footed 15	32	1	4	1				40 ft., climb 20 ft.	2 claws +9 (1d4+4)	fiery bolt +8 (1d6 fire)	5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 18, Dex 16, Con -, Int 1, Wis 11, Cha 5	4	7	20 (28 vs. trip)	AP 62	Alert (Su) A bronze sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and it possesses the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which it's keyed. When a bronze sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a bronze sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal concentration. A bronze sentinel's creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.  Fiery Bolt (Su) As a standard action, a bronze sentinel can fire a bolt of flame as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. This bolt deals 1d6 points of fire damage.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A bronze sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the electricity descriptor.																												
Bunyip	3.00	800	Medium	3	15, touch 13, flat-footed 12	32	5	7	1				10 ft., swim 50 ft.	bite +7 (1d8+1/19-20 plus bleed)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (1d6), blood frenzy, roar	Str 13, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 7	5	6	19	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Blood Rage (Ex) A bunyip's blood rage ability activates whenever it detects blood in the water using its keen scent, but otherwise functions as the universal monster rule of the same name.  Roar (Su) A bunyip's roar is supernaturally loud and horrifying.  When a bunyip roars (a standard action the creature can perform at will), all hearing creatures with 4 or fewer HD within a 100-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, creatures in the area are immune to the roar of that bunyip for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mindaffecting fear effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Burning Ghat	3.00	800	Medium	2	16, touch 12, flat-footed 14	26	3	3	6			vulnerability to cold	30 ft.	2 claws +5 (1d4+1 plus burn)		5 ft.	5 ft.	burn (2d6, DC 14), burning blood, fire burst	Str 13, Dex 15, Con -, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 14	3	4	16	Tome of Horrors 4	Burning Blood (Su) When a burning ghat takes damage from a slashing or piercing weapon, its flesh bursts open and sprays the attacker with a mixture of burning fluids. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Fire Burst (Ex) Once per day, a burning ghat can unleash a burst of flames in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Creatures caught in the burst take 4d6 points of fire damage. A successful DC 14 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The burning ghat is slowed (as the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds after using this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Odor (Ex) A burning ghat reeks of charred flesh, which can be detected at a range of 30 feet with a DC 10 Perception check. Creatures with the scent ability automatically detect its presence as soon as they come within 60 feet of a burning ghat.

Once a calpina has dealt Charisma damage equal to her Constitution score, she is fully sated and cannot use this ability again for 24 hours.  Fragrant Haze (Su) As a standard action, a calpina can release magical vapors that cause stupor and vertigo in creatures other than calpinas or their larvae. Each living creature within 20 feet must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be exhausted for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that calpina's fragrant haze for 24 hours. The DC is Charisma-based.

Str 18, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	3	7	16 (cannot be disarmed)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Immunity to Magic (Ex) A caryatid column is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a caryatid column, with no saving throw.  • Transmute mud to rock immediately heals any and all damage currently suffered by a caryatid column.  • A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the column's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 round.  Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the broken quality.  Statue (Ex) A caryatid column can stand perfectly still, emulating a statue (usually one that is holding up the ceiling, like a carved column). An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the caryatid column is alive. If a caryatid column initiates combat from this pose, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.

Str 14, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	4	6	15	Tome of Horrors Complete	Immunity to Magic (Ex) A caryatid column is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a caryatid column, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the column's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round. Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or shatter into pieces. A magic weapon uses its own save bonus or that of the wielder, whichever is higher. If the weapon breaks, the caryatid column takes no damage from the attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Str 15, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 11, Wis 14, Cha 12	4	7	19 (23 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary	Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although a centaur is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid. As a result, they wield weapons as if they were one size category smaller than their actual size (Medium for most centaurs).																												
Ceratioidi	3.00	800	Medium	0	15, touch 10, flat-footed 15	30	3	4	6				30 ft., swim 50 ft.	2 shortspears +8 (1d6+3) or 2 slams +7 (1d4+3)	2 shortspears +5 (1d6+3)	5 ft.	5 ft.	lure	Str 17, Dex 10, Con 15, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 12	4	7	17	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Dual Mind (Ex) The fact that each ceratioidi is actually two creatures sharing the same body gives it a number of unique abilities. A ceratioidi can delegate various actions and physical processes to the individual minds, allowing it to fight with two weapons simultaneously without any penalties. It can also select two favored classes. The telepathic tangle between its twin consciousnesses makes a ceratioidi impervious to mind-affecting effects.  Lure (Su) As a free action, a ceratioidi can light the dangling lure on its forehead, forcing all non-ceratioidi within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 15 Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. Regardless of the preceding interaction between the ceratioidi and its target, a creature affected by this ability does not view the ceratioidi who has fascinated it as a potential threat until that ceratioidi actually attacks-allowing it to approach without breaking the fascination. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to the same ceratioidi's lure ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Primitive Amphibian (Ex) Ceratioidi have rudimentary lungs capable of breathing air indefinitely, but their skin must be bathed in salt water regularly or it begins drying out painfully. They can go for a number of hours equal to twice their Constitution score (30 hours for most ceratioidi) before they need to be bathed in salt water-if they don't, they take 1 point of Constitution damage per hour. Any Constitution damage accrued is reversed after they spend at least 10 minutes immersed in salt water.

Those who fail take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and are confused for 1d6 rounds, and the divination effect immediately ends. The save is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Star-Shriek (Ex) Once per day as a full-round action, a cerebric fungus can unleash a shrill scream of madness. All creatures (except other cerebric fungi) within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Will save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Touch of Madness (Sp) The cerebric fungus may daze one living creature by making a successful touch attack. The target creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save, or it becomes dazed for 1 round per caster level (4 rounds for most cerebric fungi). The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it). This is a mind-affecting enchantment, equivalent to a 2nd-level spell.  Unsettling Appearance (Su) A cerebric fungus constantly scans the minds of those around it, projecting around itself a confusing collage of images gleaned from their thoughts. Creatures within 60 feet that can see the fungus must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect.  Ill Luck (Su) When a chickcharney hits a creature with one of its natural attacks, the target is exposed to the chickcharney's curse.  Curse of Ill Luck: save Will DC 14; effect the creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. A creature can be affected by a curse of ill luck multiple times (up to a maximum cumulative penalty of -4). Chickcharneys are immune to this curse. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Maddening Screech (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a chickcharney can emit a piercing cry that affects all other creatures within a 30-foot radius. An affected creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become confused for 1d3 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A successful attack deals 2d4 points of acid damage and forces the target to make a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Jabber (Su) A chon chon swarm mutters even more loudly than a solitary chon chon. Any creature attempting to cast a spell within 30 feet of a chon chon must make a successful DC 11 concentration check or lose the spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The concentration DC is Charisma-based.

Upon successfully draining blood, the chupacabra is invigorated, gaining a significant boost in speed for 10 rounds similar to the haste spell. The invigorated chupacabra can still drain blood-and in so doing increase the length of its invigoration-but it gains no additional effects.																												
Clockwork Brain Gear	3.00	800	Small	0	10, touch 6, flat-footed 10	42	3	-4	7	hardness 10		immobile	0 ft.			5 ft.	0 ft.		Str 10, Dex -, Con -, Int 20, Wis 18, Cha 14	5	4	9 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Control Clockwork (Su) Any clockwork that comes within two miles of a brain gear immediately falls under that brain gear's control. If more than one brain gear attempts to control a clockwork (or if the clockwork is under the control of another brain gear or overseer), each gear must make an opposed Intelligence check; the winner gains control of that clockwork.  When a clockwork moves more than 2 miles away from a brain gear, it continues to perform the last order given to it, but there is a 25% percent chance each hour that it ceases to function, collapsing into a pile of junk. If a brain gear later moves within two miles of the destroyed clockwork, the clockwork can reactivate if it has the self-repair ability.  Otherwise, it remains destroyed.  A brain gear in control of at least one clockwork can, as a free action once per round, use that clockwork to perceive the world through its senses (such as seeing the area surrounding the clockwork). This ability has a range of 2 miles. If a brain gear controls multiple clockworks, it can instantaneously jump from clockwork to clockwork, keeping tabs on all of its thralls and perceiving the world through their senses. A brain gear can switch control from one clockwork to another once per round as a free action. A brain gear uses this ability to give commands to its clockworks, allowing the usually mindless creatures to fight with highly coordinated tactics.  Each clockwork is capable of receiving roughly 100 words worth of orders. Anything beyond that is too complicated for the clockwork to handle.  Dream (Su) The brain gear has a limited ability to send psychic messages. Once per week, it can create an effect similar to a dream spell (caster level 10th). The brain gear can contact multiple creatures by designating a generic creature type, such as ogre or human. This designation affects every member of the target type within a 2-mile radius of the brain gear.

Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects).

Bite-injury; save Fort DC 12 + 1/2 HD + Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Cockatrice	3.00	800	Small	3	15, touch 15, flat-footed 11	27	4	7	2				20 ft., fly 60 ft. (poor)	bite +9 (1d4-2 plus petrification)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 6, Dex 17, Con 11, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 8	5	2	16	PFRPG Bestiary	Petrification (Su) A cockatrice's bite causes flesh to calcify and harden-multiple bites can cause a living creature to fossilize into stone. Each time a creature is damaged by a cockatrice's bite attack, it must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage as its flesh and bones stiffen and harden. (This slow petrification does not alter a bitten creature's natural armor.) A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by a cockatrice's bites immediately turns completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day, a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save to recover from the petrification, at which point the victim returns to flesh with 1 Dexterity (and thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal)-but after a petrified creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has its Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources. A cockatrice is immune to the petrification ability of itself and of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Deceiving Death (Ex) In any round in which a coffer corpse is struck for 6 or more points of damage (whether the damage bypasses the creature's damage reduction or not), the creature slumps to the ground, seemingly destroyed. If it has fastened its death grip on a victim, it releases its hold when it falls. A DC 20 Sense Motive check sees through the ruse (necromancers gain a +2 competence bonus on this check). On its next turn, the coffer corpse rises again as if reanimated, triggering its fear ability.  Fear (Su) A creature viewing a coffer corpse rise after it uses its deceiving death ability must make a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Integrated Stun Gun (Ex) A collector robot has an integrated stun gun slung beneath its body. This weapon uses a powerful sonic amplifier to produce powerful low-frequency blasts of energy that pummel targets. This weapon has a range increment of 20 feet, and it deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage. On a critical hit, the robot can attempt a free trip combat maneuver (CMB +12) against the target, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  Integrated Tracking (Ex) A collector robot has integrated systems that allow it to tag and track creatures. As a full-round action, a collector robot can implant a tracker chipTG into the body of a target that it is grappling or a helpless target. Once implanted, the tracker chip is activated and  the collector robot's chipfinder can detect the presence of the implanted tracker chip within 1 mile. It uses a signal to locate the tracker chips, and this signal can be blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. A tracker chip can be removed with a sharp tool. Doing so deals 1 point of damage. Once an implanted tracker chip is removed from the body (or remains in a body after it dies) it retains enough energy to continue to be detected by the collector robot's sensors for 1 week.  Reactive Gyros (Ex) The rotors that grant a collector robot flight also provide quick reactions to threats and external stimuli, granting it a +3 racial bonus on Reflex saves.

A DC 14 Reflex save negates the effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Str 15, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 6, Wis 13, Cha 14	4	5	17 (29 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Crystal Sense (Sp) Crysmals can sense the presence of any crystals or gems within 30 feet as if using the scent ability.  Shard Spike (Ex) Once per day, a crysmal can launch its tail spike as a ranged attack that shatters when it hits, dealing 3d6 points of piercing damage to the target and 1d4 points of piercing damage to all creatures in adjacent squares. The spike regrows in 24 hours, but until it does, its impaired sting does only 1d6+3 damage.																												
D'ziriak	3.00	800	Medium	2	16, touch 12, flat-footed 14	26	2	6	29				30 ft.	2 claws +6 (1d6+1 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	dazzling burst	Str 13, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 14,  Cha 16	4	50	86 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Dazzling Burst (Su) Once per day, a d'ziriak can cause its body to flare with intense, colorful light as a swift action. Non-d'ziriaks within a 20-foot radius must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 minute. After using this ability, the d'ziriak's brilliant glow is extinguished for 24 hours.

All creatures within a 10-foot burst take 1d8 points of sonic damage and must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be deafened for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Magical Knack (Ex) Spellcraft and Use Magic Device are always class skills for dark slayers.  Soul Harvest (Su) When a dark slayer damages a flat-footed foe or a foe it is flanking with a melee touch spell or spell-like ability that deals hit point damage, the spell does an additional 1d6 points of damage and the dark slayer gains an equal amount of temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for a maximum of 1 hour.

Only a miracle or wish can remove a derro's madness. If this occurs, the derro gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma. Poison Use (Ex) Derros are not at risk of poisoning themselves when handling poison. They use Medium spider venom to poison their crossbow bolts, and generally carry 10 prepoisoned bolts at all times. Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex) A derro takes 1 point of Con damage after every hour it is exposed to sunlight.

(10 ft. with trunk)	power spray	Str 19, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 8	4	8	21 (25 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Disenchant (Ex) A disenchanter can use its trunk to make a melee touch attack against a target's worn, held, or carried magic item in an attempt to drink the item's magic. The disenchanter makes a caster level check (+4) opposed by the target's Fortitude save. If the check succeeds, the disenchanter drains the item's magic, rendering it nonmagical. To determine which of a target's magic items is affected, use Table 9-2 on page 216 of the Core Rulebook (though a disenchanter never uses this ability on a headband or similar head-slot item unless it has first tried to wear the item). Disenchanters may instead target specific visible items, in which case they generally target the most obvious items. Artifacts are immune to this ability. Disenchant only works against objects that a disenchanter can touch, and even a thin layer of cloth effectively protects items from it.  Power Spray (Su) Once per day, a disenchanter can release a 20-foot cone-shaped burst of raw magical energy through its trunk. Creatures in the cone take 4d6 points of damage (DC 14 Reflex save for half ). Creatures immune to magic effects that allow spell resistance (such as golems) are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerable to Dispel Magic (Ex) A disenchanter targeted by dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6, Fortitude save for half). Greater dispel magic functions similarly (maximum 20d6 damage, Fortitude save for half).																												
Disenchanter	3.00	800	Large	3	15, touch 12, flat-footed 12	37	6	7	5				30 ft.	snout +7 touch (disenchantment) or 2 hooves +6  (1d6+3)		10 ft.	5 ft.		Str 16, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 4	4	10	21 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Disenchantment (Ex) A disenchanter that makes a successful touch attack with its snout drains one magic item carried or worn by the target (determined randomly by the DM). If the disenchanter aims at a particular item, it must make an attack roll against that item's AC. Items worn or carried have an AC equal to 10 + its size modifier + the opponent's Dexterity modifier (if any). A disenchanter does not provoke attacks of opportunity when using this ability.  An item struck must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or permanently lose all magical properties it possesses. An unattended magic item has a save bonus equal to 2 + one-half its caster level. An attended magic item either makes its save as its owner or uses its own saving throw whichever is better. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Disenchanters cannot affect artifacts.																												
Domovoi	3.00	800	Tiny	6	17, touch 15, flat-footed 14	27	3	6	5		14		20 ft.	club +4 (1d3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	telekinesis	Str 10, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 9, Wis 13, Cha 15	2	+2 (+6 grapple)	16	AP 67	Telekinesis (Su) A domovoi defends itself and its home through telekinesis. This ability functions as the spell telekinesis, usable at will, with a caster level equal to the domovoi's Hit Dice (CL 5 for most domovoi). A typical domovoi has a ranged attack roll of +5 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures, and can use the ability on objects weighing up to 50 pounds. If a domovoi attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 14 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

In addition, a doppelganger can use any spell trigger or spell completion item as if the spells were on its spell list.  Its caster level is equal to its racial Hit Dice.  Perfect Copy (Su) When a doppelganger uses change shape, it can assume the appearance of specific individuals.																												
Drekavac	3.00	800	Small	1	15, touch 12, flat-footed 14	30	4	2	7			sunlight aversion, vulnerability to magic,  vulnerability to salt	20 ft.	chilling grasp +5 touch (1d6 cold plus disease) or  shadow +5 touch (disease)		5 ft.	5 ft.	create spawn, disease, diseased shadow	Str 10, Dex 12, Con -, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 17	3	9	21 (can't be tripped)	AP 31	Create Spawn (Su) A child slain by a drekavac's disease has a 1-in- 6 chance of rising as another drekavac 3 days after death. The new drekavac is not in any way controlled by its maker, and is immediately capable of exercising its full powers, including creating spawn of its own. It does not possess any of the abilities it had in life.  Disease (Su) Drekavacs are spirits of disease and contagion.  While most drekavacs carry bubonic plague, drekavacs who died from other afflictions may carry those diseases instead.  Any illness caused by a drekavac must be potentially fatal.  Other diseases commonly carried include demon fever, filth fever, and slimy doom. If a drekavac is reduced to 0 hit points (from weapons or other sources, including channeled energy), all of the diseases it caused are cured, although the victims must recover from any effects normally, and slain victims are not restored.  Bubonic plague: Touch-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage, 1 Cha damage, victim is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Diseased Shadow (Su) Any creature touched by a drekavac's shadow is also affected by the creature's disease ability. If there is a question about which way the drekavac's shadow falls, roll 1d8 to determine a random square around the creature. A character with a light source cannot be touched by the drekavac's shadow, but the light causes the shadow to fall directly opposite the character (unless there is another light source there as well). A drekavac can deliberately touch a creature with its shadow as a standard action by making a successful touch attack.  A target missed by the drekavac's chilling grasp attack must make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid being touched by the creature's shadow as well. This save DC is Charisma-based.  Sunlight Aversion (Ex) Drekavacs hate natural sunlight and immediately flee from it. A drekavac caught in natural sunlight is staggered.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a drekavac at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. Panicked animals remain so as long as they are within 30 feet of the drekavac.  Vulnerability to Magic (Ex) A remove curse or remove disease spell cast directly upon a drekavac (DC equal to the drekavac's disease ability) immediately destroys the creature, allowing the afflicted soul to move on. Destroying a drekavac with remove curse or remove disease does not cure any of the creature's diseases.  Vulnerability to Salt (Ex) Drekavacs are vulnerable to salt that has been consecrated in the same fashion as holy water, and cannot cross an unbroken line of blessed salt. A handful of blessed salt thrown at a drekavac inflicts the same damage as a flask of holy water (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 160).																												
Drow Noble	3.00	800	Medium	3	21, touch 13, flat-footed 18	16	4	4	11		14	light blindness	20 ft.	mwk rapier +4 (1d6+1/18-20)	hand crossbow +5 (1d4/19-20 plus poison)	5 ft.	5 ft.	bleeding touch (6/day), channel negative energy (4/day, 2d6, DC 12), touch of chaos (6/day)	Str 12, Dex 17, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 17, Cha 12	2	17	33 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary	Poison Use (Ex) Drow are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Drow favor an insidious toxin that causes its victims to lapse into unconsciousness- this poison allows drow to capture slaves with great ease. Drow Poison-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/minute for 2 minutes; initial effect unconsciousness for 1 minute; secondary effect unconsciousness for 2d4 hours; cure 1 save.																												
Dryad	3.00	800	Medium	4	17, touch 14, flat-footed 13	27	5	9	1			tree dependent	30 ft.	dagger +7 (1d4)	masterwork longbow +8 (1d8)	5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 10, Dex 19, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 18	3	2	11	PFRPG Bestiary	Tree Meld (Su) A dryad can meld with any tree, similar to how the spell meld into stone functions. She can remain melded with a tree as long as she wishes.  Tree Dependent (Su) A dryad is mystically bonded to a single, enormous tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Most dryad trees are oak trees, but other trees function as well (often having subtle influences on a specific dryad's personality and appearance). A dryad who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded tree immediately becomes sickened. Every hour thereafter, she must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour. A dryad that is out of range of her bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows- eventually, this separation kills the dryad. A dryad can forge a new bond with a new tree by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 Will save.  Wild Empathy (Su) This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except the dryad has a +6 racial bonus on the check. Dryads with druid levels add this racial modifier to their wild empathy checks.  Woodcraft (Ex) A dryad has a +6 racial bonus to Craft checks involving wood, and is always treated as if she had masterwork artisan's woodworking tools when making such checks.																												
Eblis	3.00	800	Medium	3	18, touch 14, flat-footed 14	26	5	9	2				30 ft., fly 30 ft. (average)	beak +5 (1d6+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.

A spellcasting eblis has 2d4 spells, each spell usable once per day. Each spell is caster level 4th and has a save DC of 11 + the level of the spell. Eblis spells require no material or verbal components; only somatic, which consists of dancing and vocalizations. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Choose or randomly determine (using the table below) the eblis's spells. 1d8 Spell 1 ghost sound 2 disguise self 3 hypnotism 4 scare 5 fog cloud 6 blur 7 hypnotic pattern 8 whispering wind																												
Elusa Hound	3.00	800	Medium	2	15, touch 12, flat-footed 13	30	6	6	2		12		50 ft.	bite +6 (1d6+3 plus trip)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 15, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 8	4	6	18 (22 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Arcane Sight (Su) Elusa hounds can detect magical auras in a 120-foot radius, as per the arcane sight spell cast by a sorcerer at 6th level. This ability can be dispelled, but the elusa hound can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Using this ability, the elusa hound can instantly identify any spellcaster within range.  Aura Tracking (Su) If an elusa hound has "tasted" the magical aura of a living creature (a creature it has successfully used its arcane sight ability against or a spell it has successfully detected that was cast by such a creature), it gains a +10 competence bonus to its Survival check when tracking that target. The aura must be fresh ("tasted" within the last 3 hours) or the elusa hound does not gain this bonus.																												
Esobok	3.00	800	Medium	3	15, touch 13, flat-footed 12	30	6	4	6	eater of the dead			40 ft.	bite +7 (1d6+3 plus grab), 2 claws +7 (1d4+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	pounce, wrench spirit	Str 16, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 14, Cha 15	4	7	20 (24 vs. trip)	AP 80	Eater of the Dead (Su) Esoboks feed on the decaying flesh of undead. They are immune to the nauseated condition, and any effect that would normally cause them to become nauseated instead causes them to become sickened.  Wrench Spirit (Su) If an esobok begins its turn grappling a living or undead creature, it can attempt to wrench that creature's animating spirit free as a standard action. If the target succeeds at a DC 14 Will save, it takes 1d6 points of force damage; if the target fails, its spirit is stripped from its body. This effect instantly destroys mindless undead and leaves intelligent undead stunned. All other targets are paralyzed. Once per round, a creature paralyzed by this effect can attempt a new saving throw to free its soul from the esobok's jaws. An esobok can't use its bite attack while it holds a disembodied spirit, but it can release the spirit back to the spirit's body as a free action. Creatures without souls (such as constructs and oozes) and creatures whose bodies and souls are one unit (such as outsiders) are immune to this ability.																												
Ettercap	3.00	800	Medium	7	15, touch 13, flat-footed 12	30	6	4	6				30 ft., climb 30 ft.	bite +5 (1d6+2 plus poison) and 2 claws +5 (1d4+2)		5 ft.	5 ft.	traps, web (+6 ranged, DC 15, hp 4)	Str 14, Dex 17, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 15, Cha 8	3	5	18	PFRPG Bestiary	Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution based. Spider Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy, save that an ettercap can only use this ability on spiders. An ettercap gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Spiders are mindless, but this empathic communication imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing ettercaps to train giant spiders and use them as guardians. Traps (Ex) The ettercap is particularly skilled at crafting cunning traps with its webs. Deadfalls, nooses, and spear traps are the most common traps ettercaps build with their webs. An ettercap doesn't require gold to build its traps, merely time. Rules for crafting traps can be found in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Ettercap Deadfall: CR 3; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; Effect +10 melee (4d6), multiple targets (all targets in a 10-ft. square). Ettercap Noose: CR 1; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; Effect +15 CMB check (grapple). Ettercap Spear Trap: CR 2; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; Effect +15 melee (1d6+6).

Any creature struck must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or catch fire and take 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn for an additional 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Molten Heart (Ex) Beneath the slabs of igneous rock that compose a fellsig's body are organs of superheated rock and fumes. A creature that confirms a critical hit against a fellsig in melee is struck by a jet of flaming ash that deals 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 13 half).

Flail Snail	3.00	800	Large	-1	18, touch 8, flat-footed 18	30	6	3	2	warp magic			10 ft., climb 10 ft.	4 slams +7 (1d6+3)		10 ft.	5 ft. (10 ft. with tentacles)	mucus	Str 16, Dex 8, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 8	4	8	17 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Mucus (Ex) As a free action, a flail snail can excrete a trail of mucus which covers its space and lasts for 10 minutes. This mucus comes in two types: slimy and sticky. Slimy mucus covers three squares with the effects of a grease spell. Sticky mucus covers the squares with the effects of a web spell. Both effects are DC 14. The saves are Constitution-based. Flail snails are immune to this mucus. Both types of mucus can be burned way as per the web spell. Retraction (Ex) A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts back into its shell as a swift action, increasing its natural armor bonus by +6, but it cannot move or attack while retracted. It can return to normal as a free action. Slime Rope (Ex) A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike strand up to 60 ft. long, and can use this rope to hang itself and up to 1,000 extra pounds from the ceiling indefinitely, or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20 feet per round. It can climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round. Once the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes in 1d4 rounds, after which it cannot be used by the snail or any other creatures. While the slime rope exists, other creatures can climb the rope with a DC 20 Climb check. Suction (Ex) A snail's foot adheres to surfaces so well that its 10-foot climb speed applies even on perfectly sheer surfaces and ceilings, with no chance to fall off unless the foot is actively pinned and peeled away as part of a grapple. Warp Magic (Su) Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is an 80% chance that it produces a random effect instead of affecting the snail. Only spells that directly target the flail snail are warped; area effect spells are not affected. If a spell is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table. 1d10 Result 1-3 Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the caster must make a DC 15 concentration check to successfully cast spells. 4-6 Spell misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is affected as if the spell had been cast on him. 7-9 Spell fails; nothing happens 10 Spell rebounds on caster (as spell turning)

It can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Icy Breath (Su) A frost drakeling can, as a standard action, spit a line of freezing ice to a range of 20 feet. A creature struck takes 3d6 points of cold damage (DC 13 Reflex half).

Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 12 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube's paralysis and acid, gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, and are trapped within its body until they are no longer pinned. The save DC is Strength-based. Paralysis (Ex) A gelatinous cube secretes an anesthetizing slime.

Creatures attacking a fire crab unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage each time their attacks hit. Any melee hit by a fire crab deals fire damage.

This always entails a raucous aerial ritual, usually centered on those that wish to make use of this ability. The ritual functions like a teleportation circle (CL 17th), except it requires 1 minute of uninterrupted casting time, the circle doesn't need to be placed on a horizontal surface, and it is not invisible or hard to detect. After coming into existence, the edges of the circle glow and the effect stays in place for 1 minute. Most witchcrows loathe using this power, but some offer it as a service to those in need of quick travel, demanding a high price for such assistance-usually something in the bargainer's possession that is cherished, extremely valuable, and almost always magical.  Hexes (Su) A greater witchcrow uses hexes as a 5th-level witch. Invariably, these abilities include the cackle, evil eye, and misfortune hexes, and require a successful DC 15 Will save to negate or resist. Witchcrow cackling proves especially unnerving as it sounds like extremely mocking cawing.

As a standard action, it can spit these liquids on a creature within 5 feet. This spew deals 3d6 acid damage (Reflex DC 15 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Disgusting Demise (Ex) When a grothlut reaches 0 or fewer hit points, its digestive organs rupture, freeing alchemical agents that have a violent effect on the rest of the grothlut's internal organs and flesh. This causes an explosion of grothlut viscera within a 30-foot-radius burst of the creature. Though this viscera deals no damage, it's disgusting to behold and its smell can cause living creatures within that radius to become nauseated for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 14 negates). This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Piteous Moan (Su) Whenever a grothlut sees another creature, it begins to moan as free action. Anyone within 60 feet who can hear the moan must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or become sickened by the moaning for as long as she can hear it. Every two additional grothluts with the area increase the DC by 1, to a maximum of DC 18. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Str 8, Dex 17, Con -, Int 13, Wis 12, Cha 10	4	5	11	Irrisen Land Of Eternal Winter	Doll's Dagger (Su) The dagger wielded by a guardian doll is treated as a masterwork weapon and delivers 1d6 points of cold damage in addition to its normal damage. Those struck by the dagger must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed by the supernatural cold of the weapon for 1d4 rounds. If the guardian doll is destroyed, its weapon becomes a useless child's toy. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Soul Focus (Su) The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll or its apparel, typically one of the doll's eyes or a gem embedded into its neck or chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another doll, using the same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn. If it is put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality and memories from its previous bodies. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.  Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) Like a soulbound doll, a guardian doll is susceptible to mind-affecting effects. However, due to the singular purpose with which it is imbued, its saves against such effects are made with a +1 racial bonus.																												
Guardian Scroll	3.00	800	Tiny	2	15, touch 15, flat-footed 12	27	1	5	1			susceptible to mind-affecting effects, vulnerable to fire	10 ft., fly 40 ft.

Strangle (Ex) When a guardian scroll grapples a creature, it entirely covers its opponent's head with an airtight grip. A creature grappled by the scroll cannot see, speak, or cast spells with verbal components, and it must hold its breath (see Suffocation on page 445 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Creatures that don't speak or breathe through their heads aren't affected in those manners, nor are those who can see through other means blinded. Any attacks targeting a guardian scroll while it's grappling deal half damage to the scroll and the other half to the grappled creature.  Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) As an intelligent construct, a guardian scroll is subject to mind-affecting effects.

This deals 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the grapple is maintained. Once a gutslug has drained 8 points, it detaches and flies or slithers away to digest its meal. Vulnerabilities (Ex) Gutslugs are vulnerable to salt. A pint of salt deals 1d4 points of damage to a gutslug for 1d2 rounds and causes it to lose its racial bonus to grapple checks. A pint of alcohol poured or thrown on a gutslug deals no damage but causes it to lose its racial bonus to grapple checks.																												
Hag Ooze	3.00	800	Small	-5	6, touch 6, flat-footed 6	34	5	-4	1				20 ft., climb 20 ft.	slam +6 (1d4+3 plus paralysis)		5 ft.	5 ft.	paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 16), spell channel	Str 12, Dex 1, Con 18, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	3	8	22	AP 72	Spell Channel (Su) A hag creator of a hag eye ooze can see through the embedded hag eye as if she were looking from the ooze directly. This ability requires that the hag creator and the hag eye ooze be on the same plane in order to function. If the hag that created the hag eye ooze is part of a coven, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through a hag eye ooze: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, message, read magic, and tongues. A non-hag that controls a hag eye ooze can't cast spells through the ooze, nor can it see through the creature, but it can target the hag eye ooze with a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and view through it in that manner.  Suction (Ex) A hag eye ooze can create a powerful suction against any surface it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. It can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a hag eye ooze gains a +10 bonus to its CMD to resist bull rush attacks, awesome blow attacks, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.  Transparent (Ex) A hag eye ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. A successful DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a hag eye ooze. Any creature that fails to notice it and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the hag eye ooze's slam attack.

When an opponent is dragged within 5 feet, the hanged man can attack with both of its claws in the same round. It gains a +4 attack bonus against opponents entangled in its rope.  Entangle (Su) The hanged man's noose is a 20-ft. length of rope that entangles opponents of any size as an animate rope spell (CL 15th, DC 21). A hanged man can lash its rope outward 20 feet with no range penalty. The rope functions only for the hanged man it belongs to and no other. It has AC 22, hardness 10, hp 10, and DR 5/slashing. If the rope is severed, both it and the hanged man are destroyed. The save DC is Strength-based.

It deals an extra 1d3 points of cold damage with each claw attack. Creatures attacking a hoar spirit with unarmed or natural attacks take 1d3 points of cold damage each time they hit.  Glaciate (Su) A creature hit by a hoar spirit's claw must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or by paralyzed by bone-numbing cold for 1d4+1 rounds and take 1 point of Dexterity damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Heatsense (Ex) Hoar spirits can detect heat (such as that generated by living creatures) within 60 feet, including the heat of invisible creatures. It functions as blindsense in regards to any non-visible heat sources within its range.

All beings other than outsiders within 120 feet of a howling howler must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or become cursed by the creature's howl. Once a creature becomes cursed in this way, she takes no additional penalty for being exposed to additional howlers' howls until the current howler curse is lifted. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Howler Howl: Curse-howl; save Will DC 12 negates; frequency 1/hour; effect 1 Wis damage; cure 1 save.  Pain (Ex) Whenever a creature takes damage from a howler's quill attack or its quill defense, that creature must make a successful DC 14 Reflex save or one quill breaks off in its flesh, causing the target to become sickened until all embedded quills are removed. Removing one quill requires a DC 15 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check is exceeded, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process deals 1d4+1 points of damage to the victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Quill Defense (Ex) Any creature that strikes a howler with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon takes 1d4+1 points of piercing damage from the howler's quills and suffers from the howler's pain attack.

Anyone who dies from tumor infestation turns into a hungry flesh 1d4 hours later. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Monstrous Growth (Ex) A hungry flesh gains growth points from its reactive regeneration ability or from eating creatures. When it consumes a creature that's been dead no more than an hour, it gains 1 growth point if that creature is of its size or one size category smaller, or 2 growth points if its meal is larger than it is. Eating a creature takes a full-round action if it is the same size or smaller than the hungry flesh or 1 minute if it is larger. Each time a hungry flesh reaches 5 growth points, it gains the giant creature simple template. This template stacks with itself each time the hungry flesh gains another 5 growth points, but the hungry flesh can't increase its size beyond Gargantuan. When it stops gaining growth points, a hungry flesh loses a single application of the giant creature simple template for each hour that passes.  Reactive Regeneration (Ex) Whenever a hungry flesh takes piercing or slashing damage, it regenerates 5 hit points and gains 1 growth point.  Slime Trail (Ex) A hungry flesh leaves behind a trail of slime that acts as a grease spell (DC 17). Any living creature that touches this slime with bare flesh must succeed at a Fortitude save (with a +4 bonus) or contract tumor infestation. The slime dries up after 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.

An ice troll that loses a leg falls to the ground, but can continue moving at one-half speed. Severed limbs cannot attack but move at a speed of 30 feet toward the nearest source of water or ice. Regeneration (Su) If an ice troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion grows back in 2d6 minutes so long as both the ice troll and lost body part are within 30 feet of each other and are both in contact with ice or water. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump, but only if the severed member has been in contact with ice or water for at least 1 round.

Breathing creatures within the aura must hold their breath or risk suffocation. Whenever an immured deals nonlethal damage to a creature holding its breath in the aura, the duration the target can hold its breath for decreases by a number of rounds equal to the nonlethal damage dealt. The immured cannot dismiss this aura.  Bound (Su) Immured are bound to the locations in which they died. Each hour an immured remains away from the tomb or building in which it died, it takes 1d6 points of damage that can't be healed until it returns to its place of death.  Breach (Su) As a swift action, an immured can touch a nonmagical wall and open a spatial rift. The touched 5-foot section of wall (which can be up to 2 feet thick) effectively ceases to exist for 2 rounds, except for a dark, semisolid membrane that blocks line of sight through the rift. The immured can see, move, attack, or even drag a target through the rift without penalty. Other creatures can move through the rift, treating it as difficult terrain. After 2 rounds, the rift closes, pushing anything inside it into the nearest open space.  Seize (Ex) An immured can choose to deal nonlethal damage with its slam attack with no penalty on the  attack roll. In addition, an immured that deals nonlethal damage with its slam attack can attempt a drag combat maneuver against the target as a free action.

An opponent caught in this way must hold its breath or begin suffocating (see suffocation in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook).

Kirrix	3.00	800	Large	6	14, touch 11, flat-footed 12	34	7	6	2				30 ft., burrow 10 ft., climb 20 ft.	bite +7 (1d8+6)		10 ft.	5 ft.	expel pathogens	Str 18, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 8	4	9	21 (29 vs. trip)	Monster Codex	Expel Pathogens (Ex) When a kirrix hits with its bite attack, it can infect its target using its harbor pathogens ability (if any) with one disease it has stored, even if that disease can't normally be contracted via an injury. It can do this a number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier. Alternatively, a kirrix can expend two uses of this ability to spray a disease in a 15-foot cone, exposing all creatures in the cone to the disease even if it can't normally be contracted by contact. Doing so depletes the kirrix's reserve of that disease.  Harbor Pathogens (Ex) A kirrix's body has innate features that let it clean up and contain diseases within ratfolk warrens. A kirrix collects diseases by consuming them off of objects or from the air (typically contact, ingested, or inhaled diseases), by ministering to a diseased creature (typically ingested or injury diseases), or by fighting a creature that imparts diseases and being subjected to one. The kirrix can store up to two types of diseases at a time in an organ near its throat. (A typical kirrix has filth fever and bubonic plague stored.) A kirrix can harmlessly digest an unwanted disease as a full-round action. If the creature consumes a mold or another substance that causes disease, it clears the surface of disease. If it ingests a diseased creature's blood (either by licking an open wound or biting the creature), it can produce an antiplague secretion, which it can use on itself or apply to others. Treat this as though the kirrix were using the Heal skill to treat disease with a +12 bonus.																												
Knight Gaunt	3.00	800	Medium	1	21, touch 11, flat-footed 20	26	3	2	5		14		20 ft. (base 30 ft.)	longsword +6 (1d8+3 plus bleed) or 2 claws +5 (1d4+2 plus bleed)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (1d4), smite good, weapon attunement	Str 15, Dex 12, Con -, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 15	3	5	16	Tome of Horrors 4	Smite Good (Su) Once per day, a knight gaunt can smite good. As a swift action, the knight gaunt chooses one target within sight. If this target is good, the knight gaunt adds its Charisma bonus on its attack rolls and adds its Hit Dice on all damage rolls made against that target. If the target is an outsider with the good subtype or a good-aligned creature with levels of cleric of paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack is doubled. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. Additionally, the knight gaunt gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus to AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. The smite good remains in effect until the target of the smite is dead or until 24 hours have passed.  Weapon Attunement (Su) A knight gaunt gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with any melee weapon it wields. Additionally, it gains the bleed special attack with any melee weapon it wields.																												
Kyrana	3.00	800	Medium	2	14, touch 12, flat-footed 12	30	5	6	3			vulnerable to cold	30 ft.	bite +8 (1d4+3), 2 claws +7 (1d3+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	breath weapon (20-ft. line, 3d6 fire damage, Reflex DC 13 half, usable every 1d4 rounds)	Str 16, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 3, Wis 9, Cha 6	4	7	19 (23 vs. trip)	Monster Codex	Fiery Regeneration (Su) A kyrana does not take damage from fire-based attacks. Additionally, when a kyrana would normally take fire damage, it heals that number of hit points, to a maximum of 5 hit points per round. A kyrana can't use its breath weapon to heal itself.																												
Lacridaemon	3.00	800	Medium	7	15, touch 13, flat-footed 12	30	6	4	5		14		40 ft.	bite +6 (1d4+2 plus 1d4 acid and poison), 2 claws +7 (1d4+2 plus 1d4 acid)		5 ft.	5 ft.	poisonous tears	Str 14, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 12	4	6	19	Horsemen Of The Apocalypse	Poisonous Tears (Su) A lacridaemon's tears are poisonous to other creatures. As a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity, a lacridaemon can coat both of its claws with its tears, giving its next attack the possibility of poisoning its victim. A lacridaemon must attack with its claws on the same round or the round immediately after it applies its tears in order to use this ability; after that time, the tears lose their potency. Once it has attacked a creature using its tear-coated claws, a lacridaemon  must reapply the tears again in order to use this ability. A lacridaemon's bite attack is always treated as having its poisonous tears applied to it.  Lacridaemon poison: Injury; save Fortitude DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Wis plus staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Weeping Aura (Su) A lacridaemon emits an invisible aura that sounds like the whimpers of a crying child. The whimpers sound almost as if they're coming from all directions at once, or perhaps from one's own mind, disorienting those within the aura's area. Any creature that enters this area takes a -5 penalty on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. Creatures within the aura's range need not be able to physically hear the whimpers in order to be affected by this ability (and those who try to identify its origin so they can get nearer take a -5 penalty on their Perception checks to do so). A lacridaemon can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action, and the effects from multiple lacridaemon auras stack (up to a maximum penalty of -20). This aura is a sonic, mind-affecting effect.																												
Lamhigyn	3.00	800	Small	6	15, touch 13, flat-footed 13	27	4	6	2				10 ft., fly 60 ft.

Wrap Wings (Ex) When a lamhigyn uses its wing attacks to grab an opponent, it wraps its wings around its opponent's head, causing the victim to gain the blinded condition for as long as the lamhigyn grapples that creature. A grappling lamhigyn automatically deals wing damage while grappling, but it takes the normal -2 penalty on attack rolls for its sting attack. This ability has no effect on creatures that do not have sensory organs in their heads.																												
Large Acid Quasi-elemental	3.00	800	Large	6	19, touch 11, flat-footed 17	51	5	7	5			vulnerability to water	20 ft., swim 80 ft.	2 slams +8 (1d6+3 plus 1d6 acid)		10 ft.	10 ft.	acid, drench	Str 17, Dex 14, Con 17, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	6	10	22	Tome of Horrors Complete	Acid (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals are living creatures of acid; any melee hit deals acid damage. Creatures hitting an acid quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack. Acid Swimmer (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic nature of their environment on their home plane. Drench (Ex) The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals the quasi-elemental's HD). Fumes (Ex) The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body act as an inhaled poison. Creatures within 5 ft. of an acid quasi-elemental must make succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage each round. This poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves more than 5 ft. away from the acid quasi-elemental. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by water. An acid quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasi-elemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental.																												
Large Monstrous Sea Wasp	3.00	800	Large	1	12, touch 11, flat-footed 11	22	5	2	1	transparent			swim 60 ft.	tentacle +3 (1d8+1 plus poison)		10 ft.	10 ft.	entangle	Str 13, Dex 13, Con 12, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2	3	5	16 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Entangle (Ex) A sea wasp can entangle a creature up to two sizes smaller than itself with its tentacles with a successful CMB check. An entangled opponent suffers tentacle damage and the effect of its poison each round the hold is maintained. An entangled creature still receives a save to avoid the effects of its poison. While a foe is entangled, the sea wasp cannot attack any other creature. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; the effects of the poison are determined by the creature's size (see table below). The DC of the save is Constitution-based. Size Fort DC Frequency Effect Cure Tiny 10 1/round for 1d4 rounds 1 Con 1 save Small 11 1/round for 1d4 rounds 1d2 Con 1 save Medium 11 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d3 Con 1 save Large 13 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d4 Con 2 consecutive saves Huge 15 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d6 Con 2 consecutive saves Gargantuan 20 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d8 Con 3 consecutive saves Jet (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp can jet backward once per round as a full-round action at a speed equal to four times its swim speed. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting. Transparent (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp is nearly invisible floating in the water. An observer must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice the sea wasp. Watersense (Ex) Monstrous sea wasps can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with water.																												
Large Obsidian Quasi-elemental	3.00	800	Large	-1	17, touch 8, flat-footed 17	51	5	4	5				20 ft.	2 claws +11 (1d8+6)		5 ft.	5 ft.	death throes, molten glass (2d6 fire, DC 16)	Str 22, Dex 8, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	6	13	22	Tome of Horrors Complete	Death Throes (Ex) When reduced to 0 or less hit points, an obsidian quasi-elemental explodes in a cloud of razor-sharp bits of obsidian. A creature caught in the area can make a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics for each elemental's death throes. Molten Glass (Ex) A successful hit against an obsidian quasi-elemental with a piercing or slashing weapon (or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage equal to its current HD opens a wound that spurts molten glass. The wound bleeds for 1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a Reflex save or take fire damage from the splash. A new save must be made each round the wound bleeds and a creature is within the area. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.																												
Large Spriggan	3.00	800	Large	3	14, touch 12, flat-footed 11	34	8	4	1				30 ft.	mwk morningstar +9 (2d6 +5)	light crossbow +5 (2d6/19-20)	10 ft.	10 ft.	sneak attack +2d6	Str 21, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 10, Wis 10,  Cha 9	3	9	22	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Size Alteration (Su) At will as a standard action, a spriggan can change his size between Small and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the spriggan's person grow proportionally when he changes size (objects revert to normal size 1 round after a spriggan releases them). When a spriggan becomes Large, his speed increases to 30 feet, he gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +6 Constitution, and he takes a -2 size penalty to his AC. While Large, a spriggan cannot use his sneak attack or his racial spell-like abilities (although if he possesses either from class levels or templates, he retains their use in both sizes).  Spriggan Magic (Ex) A spriggan gains a +1 racial bonus on concentration checks and to save DCs for all of its racial spell-like abilities.  Spriggan Skills (Ex) Climb, Disable Device, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth are class skills for spriggans.																												
Lava Child	3.00	800	Medium	1	16, touch 11, flat-footed 15	30	5	5	5			vulnerability to cold and water	30 ft., burrow 10 ft.	2 claws +6 (1d4+2), bite +6 (1d4+2 plus 1d6 fire)		5 ft.	5 ft.	magma throwing, rend (2 claws, 1d4+3)	Str 15, Dex 12, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 13	4	6	17	Misfit Monsters	Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing lava child can pass through stone, dirt, metal, lava, or almost any other sort of earth as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripples or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing lava child flings the creature back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.  Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex) A lava child is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance and has the earth descriptor.  Magma Throwing (Su) A lava child can cough up a ball of magma into its hand as a move action. It remains hot as long as the lava child holds it, but cools to the ambient temperature 1 round after it is released. A lava child can throw a magma ball as if it were a flask of alchemist's fire, or add its damage to one successful claw attack. It can use this ability a number of times per day equal to its Hit Dice. On any round in which the lava child remains partially immersed in molten stone and does not leave it, it may scoop up a handful as a move action and then throw it as if using this ability, but that action does not count toward its daily limit.  Metal Immunity (Su) Lava children ignore the presence of metal and are able to pass through it as easily as air. They are immune to metal weapons, and their attacks ignore any AC bonus (including enhancement bonuses) from metal armor and shields.  Vulnerability to Cold and Water (Ex) Spells and effects with the water or cold subtype inflict +50% damage against lava children (though these vulnerabilities do not stack-effects that are both cold and water still deal only an additional +50% damage). Splashing a lava child with at least 1 gallon of water inflicts 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Immersion in water causes lava children to take 2d6 points of damage per round and affects them as a slow spell while they remain submerged.																												
Lava Child	3.00	800	Medium	4	16, touch 10, flat-footed 16	22	5	1	1			elemental vulnerability, vulnerability to cold	30 ft.	2 claws +4 (1d4+1) and bite +4 (1d6+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	rend (2 claws, 2d4+1)	Str 13, Dex 11, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 11	3	4	14	Tome of Horrors Complete	Elemental Vulnerability (Ex) Lava children take 1 extra point of damage per caster level from spells and effects with the air or water subtype and from spells of the Air and Water domains. Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex) Lava children are immune to all spells and effects with the earth descriptor and all spells of the Earth domain. Immunity to Metal (Ex) Lava children are completely immune to any metal object or weapon and its effects (swords, armor, doors, walls, for example). Metal simply passes through the lava child as though it did not exist. Metal items are not destroyed, just ignored. Any metal weapon (including magic weapons) that strikes a lava child deals no damage and simply passes through its body. Likewise a lava child can simply walk through metal doors or walls as though they did not exist. All attacks against a metal-armored foe are considered melee touch attacks as the lava child's attacks simply pass through the metal armor.																												
Lesser Gelid Beetle	3.00	800	Medium	0	17, touch 10, flat-footed 17	30	6	4	1			vulnerability to cold	30 ft.	bite +6 (1d4+2 plus 1d4 cold)		5 ft.	5 ft.	cold, cold spray	Str 15, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 1, Wis 10, Cha 9	4	6	16	Tome of Horrors Complete	Cold (Ex) A gelid beetle's body generates cold that deals an extra 1d4 points of cold damage every time it succeeds on a bite attack. Creatures attacking a gelid beetle unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.  Cold Spray (Ex) Once per day a gelid beetle can release a spray in a 10-foot cone that deals 2d4 points of cold damage. Those within the cone who succeed a DC 13 Fortitude save take only half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Lesser Host Devil	3.00	800	Small	3	17, touch 15, flat-footed 13	30	6	7	0				5 ft., fly 60 ft.

If it's not wielding a weapon, a gaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks. In addition, it takes up to eight gaavs cooperatively to lift a creature that one or more of them is grappling; each gaav can lift up to 50 pounds and still fly without being impeded. Noxious Breath (Su) Three times per day, a gaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same gaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. Once a gaav uses its breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. Shared Senses (Su) All gaavs and magaavs within 100 feet of one another share the same senses. Thus, if one individual perceives something (for example, with a successful Perception check), all others within range are immediately aware of it. Senses are instantly relayed from one gaav or magaav to the next, allowing for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread through and inform an entire massive swarm instantly. It is still possible for a gaav to be surprised or flat-footed even if other gaavs nearby are not. Summon Devil (Su) Once per day a gaav can attempt to summon an imp with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell. Swarming (Ex) Up to two gaavs can share the same space at the same time. If two gaavs in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.

The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus. Creatures wearing metal armor take an extra +2 points of damage from a lightning mephit's breath weapon.  Fast Healing (Ex) A lightning mephit heals only if exposed electricity (whether natural, such as an electrical storm, or magical, such as its own shocking grasp or lightning bolt spell-like ability).  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A lightning mephit takes 1d4 points of damage per gallon of water it contacts. Pouring water onto a lightning mephit requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level to a lightning mephit within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against a lightning mephit.

Another strike by the same weapon causes the metal weapon to be destroyed if it fails a second save. Wood weapons are destroyed after only one failed save. Unarmed and natural attacks made against the magmin deal 1 point of fire damage to the attacker. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Searing Aura (Ex) A magmin radiates extremely high temperatures, and any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of a magmin must  succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Mallor Demon	3.00	25600	Large	6	29, touch 16, flat-footed 27	217	21	11	7		24		40 ft.,	#ERROR!		10 ft.	5 ft.	fear gaze, foul liquids	Str 27, Dex 15, Con 30, Int 16, Wis 16, Cha 20	14	23	40 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Fear Gaze (Su) The infernal eyes of a mallor weaken the resolve of opponents peering into them. Creatures meeting its gaze must make a successful DC 22 Will save or flee in fear for 1d6 rounds. On a successful save, that opponent is immune to the fear gaze of that mallor for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Foul Liquid (Su) All liquids within 100 feet of a mallor automatically foul and become unsuitable for consumption or inhabitation (no save). Magical liquids in the area receive a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid the effects. Creatures drinking fouled water must make a successful DC 27 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 minute. Aquatic creatures (or those that can breathe water) swimming in fouled water must make a Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each round they remain in the area or begin suffocating.  A mallor can foul up to 20 gallons of liquid a day using this ability. Sentient- or liquid-based creatures (such as water elementals) must make a successful DC 27 Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of Constitution damage each hour they remain in the area. At Constitution 0, the creature's liquid structure fouls and it dies. The save DCs are Constitution-based. A mallor can suppress or resume this ability at will as a free action.  Poison (Ex) Claw-injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Strength; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

If successful, the marine crocodile maintains its grapple.  Hold Breath (Ex) A marine crocodile can hold its breath a number of rounds equal to 8 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Earth Mastery (Ex) An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)

Medium Gravity Elemental	3.00	800	Medium	4	16, touch 16, flat-footed 12	24	4	8	4	distortion			fly 100 ft. (perfect)	slam +8 (1d4+3)	missile +8 (damage by type)	5 ft.	5 ft.	engulf, gravity field (crush 2/day, 10 ft. radius, DC 14, 2d6 bludgeoning)	Str 14, Dex 19, Con 16, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	4	6	22	Tome of Horrors Complete	Distortion (Su) The manipulation of light waves around a gravity elemental grants it a +2 deflection bonus to its Armor Class. Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds.																												
Medium Ice Elemental	3.00	800	Medium	0	16, touch 10, flat-footed 16	30	6	4	1			vulnerable to fire	20 ft., burrow (ice and snow only) 20 ft., swim 60 ft.	slam +7 (1d6+4 plus 1d4 cold)		5 ft.	5 ft.	numbing cold (DC 14)	Str 16, Dex 10, Con 15, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	4	7	17 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Ice Glide (Su) A burrowing ice elemental can pass through nonmagical ice and snow as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A control water spell cast on an area containing a burrowing ice elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the elemental climbs must be icy. The elemental can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Numbing Cold (Su) When an ice elemental deals cold damage to a creature, that creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is listed in the elemental's stat block and is Constitution-based. Snow Vision (Ex) An ice elemental can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

Spark Leap (Ex) A lightning elemental gains a +10 bonus on bull rush, disarm, overrun, and trip attacks when it charges a creature against whom its metal mastery ability applies.																												
Medium Magma Elemental	3.00	800	Medium	3	16, touch 9, flat-footed 16	30	6	3	1			vulnerable to cold	20 ft., burrow 20 ft.	slam +6 (1d6+3 plus burn)		5 ft.	5 ft.	burn (1d4, DC 12), lava puddle	Str 14, Dex 8, Con 15, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	4	6	15	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Burn (Ex) A magma elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn quite as hot as true elemental flames. Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Lava Puddle (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a puddle of lava (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) that fills its space to a depth of 2-3 inches and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round. The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after a number of rounds equal to the elemental's Hit Dice. At the GM's discretion, this puddle of lava could start secondary fires.																												
Medium Mud Elemental	3.00	800	Medium	0	16, touch 10, flat-footed 16	30	6	4	1				20 ft., burrow 10 ft., swim 30 ft.	slam +7 (1d6+4 plus entrap)		5 ft.	5 ft.	entrap (DC 14, 10 minutes, hardness 5, hp 5)	Str 16, Dex 10, Con 15, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	4	7	17	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing mud elemental can pass through dirt, gravel, or other loose or porous solid matter as easily as a fish swims through water. It cannot use this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.  Entrap (Ex) The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3 rounds of immersion in water.																												
Medium Smoke Elemental	3.00	800	Medium	8	17, touch 14, flat-footed 13	30	6	8	1	air mastery, amorphous		vulnerability to cold, vulnerability to wind	fly 80 ft. (perfect)	slam +5 (1d6+1 plus burn)		5 ft.	5 ft.	burn (1d4, DC 11), engulf (DC 13)	Str 13, Dex 19, Con 14, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	4	5	19 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Air Mastery (Ex) Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a smoke elemental.  Burn (Ex) A smoke elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn as hot as a true fire elemental's flames.  Engulf (Ex) A smoke elemental can engulf creatures of its size or smaller into its smoky form as part of a standard action. It cannot make any other attack in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that are not adjacent to them.  Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Gaseous (Ex) A smoke elemental can pass through small holes or narrow openings without reducing its speed.  Vulnerability to Wind (Ex) A smoke elemental is treated as two sizes smaller for purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.																												
Medium Water Elemental	3.00	800	Medium	1	17, touch 11, flat-footed 16	30	6	5	1				20 ft., swim 90 ft.	slam +7 (1d8+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	drench, vortex (DC 15), water mastery	Str 16, Dex 12, Con 15, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	4	7	18	PFRPG Bestiary	Drench (Ex) The elemental's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental's HD). Vortex (Su) A water elemental can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (see page 306), but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water. Water Mastery (Ex) A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.																												
Medusa Head	3.00	800	Small	1	15, touch 12, flat-footed 14	30	3	2	4				fly 40 ft. (perfect)	bite +6 (1d4+2 plus petrifying bite)		5 ft.	5 ft.

Mindslaver Mold	3.00	800	Small	7	15, touch 15, flat-footed 11	30	7	4	2	avoidance	14		5 ft., climb 5 ft.		spore pod +7 touch (spores)	5 ft.	5 ft.	infestation, spores	Str 2, Dex 17, Con 17, Int 14, Wis 12, Cha 13	3	-2	12 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Avoidance (Ex) When a mindslaver mold is infesting a living or undead creature and would be hit by an attack, it can make a Reflex save as an immediate action. If the mold succeeds, the attack doesn't harm it and instead harms the infested creature-the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the incoming attack so that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The mindslaver mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved but before damage is rolled.  Infestation (Su) A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host, the mold shares the same 5-foot square with its host's space; this does not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the host takes a -4 penalty on Will saves against the mindslaver mold's dominate person spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free of a host with a successful DC 15 Strength check as a standard action-doing so deals 2d6 points of damage to the host as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no damage in this way.  Mold Mindlink (Su) A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other mindslaver mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver molds in this area as if it had a status spell in effect on all other molds.  Spore Pod (Ex) A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod the size of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack that has a range increment of 20 feet.  Spores (Su) Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the mold with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage as the mold's spores swiftly drain away the victim's willpower and sense of self. The save DC is Constitution-based.

All creatures within the area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d3 rounds.  Other mobats and urdefhans (see page 276) are immune to this effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Mobat Bat	3.00	800	Large	5	15, touch 14, flat-footed 10	34	7	9	2				20 ft., fly 40 ft.

The screech stuns any creature in the area for 1d3 rounds if it fails a DC 15 Will save. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save succeeds an affected creature is immune to the same mobat's screech for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Tree Climber (Ex) When climbing trees and other foliage, a moss troll's climb speed increases to 30 feet. If a moss troll falls while climbing in trees, it ignores the first 30 feet it falls for the purposes of calculating total damage from the fall. While climbing in trees, a moss troll gains a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks.

Any melee hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A wooden weapon that strikes a mudbog dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. The mudbog's acidic touch deals 17 points of acid damage per round to wooden objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Camouflage (Ex) The consistency and coloration of a mudbog makes it difficult to discern from a normal patch of mud. Any creature within 10 feet of a mudbog must make a DC 20 Perception or Survival check to determine the actual nature of the creature.  Engulf (Ex) A Medium or smaller opponent that walks into a mudbog is automatically grappled and takes 1d6 acid damage each round the mudbog maintains the hold.  Engulfed creatures are considered to be grappled and are trapped within the mudbog's body. This ability otherwise functions as swallow whole, save that a creature that cut its way out of a mudbog leaves no hole in the protoplasmic creature's body.

This never reduces the light level to supernatural darkness. Multiple worgs within range can reduce the light level multiple steps. Because a mythic worg has darkvision and low-light vision, this ability never interferes with its own vision. It can end this ability as a free action.

If a necrocraft is built with more CP than its size category would allow, its CR increases by 1 (minimum of +1) for every 2 additional CP spent. Unless otherwise stated, each of these abilities can be purchased only once. The stats presented here are for a Medium necrocraft (with 2 CP spent on additional movement [fly] and extra attack [bite]).  Additional Movement (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains a new mode of movement (burrow, climb, fly [clumsy], or swim) at a speed equal to its base speed.  All-Around Vision (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft has an additional head facing in the opposite direction from its main head, or has extra eyes grafted at various points around its body. The necrocraft gains all-around vision.  Blade Fists (Ex, 1 CP): Up to two of the necrocraft's claw attacks are replaced with sharpened bones or metal blades. These attacks deal 1d4 points of bleed damage. This ability can be selected multiple times, applying it to more claw attacks.  Bone Armor (Ex, 1 CP): Fortified with extra bone (perhaps including bones fused to its outer surface like armor), the necrocraft increases its natural armor bonus by 2. This ability can be selected up to three times.  Cannibalize (Ex, 1 CP): If the necrocraft is left near the corpse of a Medium or larger creature with discernible anatomy, it eats the corpse or tears off parts to repair its own substance. An undead creature consumed in this fashion heals the necrocraft 5 hit points plus 5 hit points per size category above Medium; any other type of creature restores only 1/5 this amount. Feeding takes 1 hour; any interruption (such as combat) requires it to start again.  Constrict (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft's claw attacks gain the constrict ability. It must have grab before this ability can be selected.  Disease (Su, 1 CP): One of the necrocraft's natural attacks is grafted with ghoul mouthparts, exposing a creature it hits to ghoul fever.  Ghoul Fever: Bite, claw, or slam-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast.  Extra Attack (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains an additional bite attack or claw attack. This ability can be selected multiple times.  Extra Legs (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains two more legs, increasing its base speed by 5 feet and increasing its CMD against overrun and trip attempts by 4. This ability can be selected multiple times.  Extra Strength (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft's Strength increases by 2 but its Dexterity decreases by 2. This ability can be selected twice.  Faster (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft's base, burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed increases by 10 ft.  Grab (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains the grab ability with its natural attacks.  Metal Armor (Ex, 2 CP): Metal plates are bolted to or fused with the necrocraft, serving as armor and granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC.  Mostly Skeletons (Ex, 1 CP): Most of the necrocraft's parts come from undead skeletons. The necrocraft gains DR 5/ bludgeoning and resist cold 5. This ability can't be added to a necrocraft with the mostly zombies ability.  Mostly Zombies (Ex, 1 CP): Most of the necrocraft's parts come from zombies. The necrocraft gains DR 5/slashing and 5 additional hit points. This ability can't be added to a necrocraft with the mostly skeletons ability.  Paralysis (Su, 2 CP): Up to three of necrocraft's natural attacks gain the paralysis ability (1d4+1 rounds, DC 13, elves are immune to this effect). This graft requires the body of at least 1 ghoul. For an additional Construction Point, the paralysis ability can affect elves.  Reach Attacks (Ex, 1 CP): Up to two of the necrocraft's natural attacks increase their natural reach by 5 feet. This ability can be selected multiple times. Rending Claws (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft gains the rend ability, activating when both claws hit and dealing additional damage equal to the damage dice for one claw plus 1-1/2 times the necrocraft's Strength bonus.  Rotting Flesh (Ex, 2 CP): Two of the necrocraft's bite or claw attacks are poisonous. Poison: bite or claw-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d3 Constitution damage; cure 1 save.  Stench (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft has the stench ability (10- foot radius, Fort DC 15 negates, sickened for 1d6+4 minutes). This graft requires the body of at least one ghoul.  Trample (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft gains the trample universal monster ability as a special attack.																												
Necrophidius	3.00	800	Medium	3	15, touch 13, flat-footed 12	36	1	4	1				30 ft.	bite +6 (1d8+4 plus paralysis)		5 ft.	5 ft.	dance of death	Str 16, Dex 17, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	3	7	20 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Dance of Death (Ex) A necrophidius can entrance opponents by swaying back and forth as a full-round action. All creatures within 30 feet who can see the necrophidius when it uses its dance of death must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be dazed for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  Paralysis (Su) Any living creature that is bitten by a necrophidius must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Normal Spriggan	3.00	800	Small	4	19, touch 15, flat-footed 15	22	2	8	4				20 ft.	halberd +3 (1d8-1/x3) or short sword +7 (1d4-1/19-20)	heavy crossbow +7 (1d8/19-20)	5 ft.	5 ft.	sneak attack +2d6	Str 8, Dex 18, Con 13, Int 11, Wis 11, Cha 10	2	0	14	Tome of Horrors Complete	Size Alteration (Su) At will, a spriggan can grow from Small to Large size or back again. Weapons, armor, and other inanimate objects on its person grow proportionately with it when it changes size. This is similar to the enlarge person spell. An enlarged spriggan gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, and a -2 to AC. While enlarged, a spriggan cannot use its spell-like abilities or its innate sneak attack ability (though any other sneak attack it may have, such as from rogue class levels, is unaffected when it changes size).																												
Oakman	3.00	800	Small	1	17, touch 12, flat-footed 15	16	3	4	5			tree dependent	20 ft., climb 30 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	shillelagh	Str 12, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 15, Cha 14	1	1	12	Tome of Horrors Complete	Shillelagh (Su) Any oaken club or staff wielded by an oakman automatically gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell (caster level 5th). The oakman does not have to cast this spell to get the benefit; its effects are automatic as long as the club or staff is in the oakman's hands. (This benefit is already included in the statistics block above.) In anyone else's hands, the oaken club or staff functions as a normal weapon of whatever type it is. Moss (Ex) Using his unique knowledge of plants and herbal mixtures, an oakman can concoct unusual cakes from tree moss. A typical oakman has 1d6 moss cakes of random type on his person. These moss cakes have a variety of effects and must be eaten by the target creature to take effect. Saves (where applicable) have a DC of 15. Ability Score Damage: The victim suffers 1d6 points of ability damage to a random ability (determined when the moss cake is created). One day after eating the moss cake, if the victim doesn't receive a restoration spell, it must make another successful save or one point of the ability damage is actually drain. Coloration: This moss cake is quite harmless when eaten and does nothing more than cause the victim's skin to become spotted. The spots can be of just about any color, though most tend to be brown, red, or blue. The spots last for 1 hour before fading. Healing: This moss cake heals the target as by a heal spell cast by a 5th-level cleric. Lethargy: The victim falls into a state of apathy and becomes sluggish if it fails a Fortitude save. The effects last for 30 minutes. While affected, the victim moves at one-half its normal speed and suffers a -2 circumstance penalty to AC and on attack rolls, checks, and saves. Pain: Eating this moss cake wracks the victim with pain for 1d4 hours if it fails a Fortitude save. During this time, the victim suffers a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and ability and skill checks. Poison: Eating this moss cake poisons the victim (ingestion; save Fort DC 15; effect 1d6 Con, cure two consecutive saves). Sleep: This moss cake puts the victim to sleep for 1 hour (as the sleep spell) if it fails a Fortitude save. Tree Dependent (Su) An oakman is mystically bonded to a single, enormous tree and must never stray more than a mile from it. An oakman who moves more than a mile from his bonded tree immediately becomes sickened. Every hour thereafter, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour. An oakman that is out of range of his bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows-eventually, this separation kills the oakman. An oakman cannot forge a new bond with a new tree; if his tree is destroyed, he will eventually sicken and die. Tree Stride (Su) At will, an oakman can create an effect identical to that of the tree stride spell (caster level 5th). Oakmen can only travel through oak trees. This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the oakman can restart it on its next turn.

When interacting with other kinds of creatures, they can only convey simple emotions such as anger, fear, and curiosity.  Phasing Attack (Su) As a full-round action, a pard can shift itself partially out of phase, damaging any creature it moves through. This works like the overrun combat maneuver, but the pard must move at least 30 feet and it gains a +4 bonus on the check. If it succeeds, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage. If it exceeds a creature's CMD by 5 or more, it stuns the creature for 1 round instead of knocking it prone. The target can make an attack of opportunity, but at a -4 penalty. If the target forgoes an attack of opportunity provoked by this maneuver, it can try to avoid the pard by attempting a DC 19 Reflex save; if successful, it takes only half damage. The pard can only deal phasing attack damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature. When using this ability, the pard can move through up to 5 feet of any solid object, barrier, or difficult terrain as if it were a normal open square. The pard cannot end its movement inside a creature or solid barrier. This ability counts as trample for the purposes of effects that enhance or protect against trample. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the pech takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers are not precalculated into the statistics here.  Pech Magic (Sp) Four pechs working together can cast wall of stone once per day. Eight pechs working together can cast stone to flesh (DC 17) once per day. These spell-like abilities function at CL 10th. Each pech must use a full-round action to take part in the casting. The save DCs are modified by the highest Charisma modifier in the group.  Stone Knowledge (Ex) A pech's knowledge of earth and stone grants a +1 racial bonus on attack and damage rolls and the benefits of the Improved Critical feat against creatures and objects made of stone or earth or with the earth subtype. Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (engineering) and Profession (miner) are always class skills for a pech.

If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the pech takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) Light Blindness (Ex) Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds a pech for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. Stone Knowledge (Ex) The extensive knowledge of stone that a pech possesses grants it a +1 racial bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures made of stone or earth (such as earth elementals, stone golems, and so on).

Str 15, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 9	3	5	15 (17 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Phantom Flesh (Su) As a move action, a phantom fungus can turn invisible as if using greater invisibility (caster level 4th). A moment after it attacks with invisibility, the creature appears briefly as a semi-transparent version of its normal self. This allows any viewer with line of sight to the phantom fungus to pinpoint its location at the time of the attack (though if the creature moves after it attacks, opponents have to pinpoint it again). An opponent can ready an action to strike at the fungus when it momentarily appears, in which case the creature only has concealment instead of invisibility (20% miss chance). The fungus can turn completely visible as a move action, though it normally remains invisible all the time. If killed while invisible, it becomes visible 1d4 minutes later.

A successful DC 14 Reflex save reduces damage by 1/2. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Death Throes (Ex) If a phlogiston bush is reduced to 0 or less hit points, it explodes in a concussive blast of fire that deals 4d6 points of fire damage to all creatures in a 10-foot radius.  A successful DC 14 Reflex save reduces damage by 1/2. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Tree Stride (Su) As a free action, a phooka can enter a tree and move from it to another tree with 50 feet as if by a tree stride spell. A phooka can remain inside a tree as long as it wishes. This ability otherwise resembles the spell of the same name.

The flames burst from within the target creature and immediately burn out, so there is no continuing damage or burn effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same pyrolisk's conflagration gaze for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Pyrotechnics (Su) Once per round, a pyrolisk can cause an ordinary fire to burst into a shower of flashes, sparks, and bursts of light (as pyrotechnics, fireworks version only).

It loses this invisibility and remains visible for 1 round in any round in which it takes an action other than a free action.  Supernatural Speed (Su) A quickling moves with incredible speed. Save for when it remains motionless (at which point it is invisible), the quickling's shape blurs and shimmers with this speed, granting it concealment (20% miss chance). In addition, this ability grants the quickling evasion and uncanny dodge (as the rogue abilities of the same names).  Slow Susceptibility (Ex) A quickling that succumbs to a slow effect loses its supernatural speed ability and is sickened as long as the effect persists. This sickened condition persists for 1 round after the slow effect ends.

Poison Use (Ex) A quickling is never at risk of poisoning itself when handling poison. They usually use kava leaf poison on their daggers.  Supernatural Speed (Su) A quickling moves with incredible speed. Save for when it remains motionless (at which point it is invisible), a quickling's shape blurs and shimmers with this speed, granting it concealment (20% miss chance). In addition, this ability grants the quickling evasion and uncanny dodge (as the rogue abilities of the same name).

This attack has a range of 50 feet, deals 2d8 points of acid damage, and entangles creatures in the area. A DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangle effect. An entangled creature takes 1d4 points of acid damage each round on its turn, and may attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn every round to escape the entanglement and end the acid damage. Once a river drake spits mucus, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a river drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an additional move action that round.																												
Rust Monster	3.00	800	Medium	3	18, touch 13, flat-footed 15	27	2	4	5				40 ft., climb 10 ft.	bite +6 (1d3), antennae +6 touch (rust)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 10, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 8	3	3	16 (20 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary	Rust (Su) A rust monster's antennae are a primary touch attack that causes any metal object they touch to swiftly rust and corrode. The object touched takes half its maximum hp in damage and gains the broken condition-a second hit destroys the item. A rust monster never provokes attacks of opportunity by attempting to strike a weapon with its antennae. Against creatures made of metal, a rust monster's antennae deal 3d6+5 points of damage. An attended object, any magic object, or a metal creature can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Scent Metals (Ex) This ability functions much the same as the scent ability, except that the range is 90 feet and the rust monster can only use it to sense metal objects (including creatures wearing or carrying metal objects).

In this form, treat the sandman as if it were a Small earth elemental made out of sand. The sandman retains its compression and sleep aura abilities when in sand form, but loses its sleep attack and its damage reduction, as its sandy body in this form is much more compact and easier to scatter with solid weapon blows.  Sleep (Su) A creature struck by a sandman's slam attack must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or immediately fall asleep, as if affected by a sleep spell (caster level 8th). There is no limit to the number of Hit Dice a sandman can affect with this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Sleep Aura (Su) A sandman radiates a 20-foot-radius spread that puts creatures to sleep. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or fall asleep, as if affected by a sleep spell (caster level 8th).

Creatures attacking a sandman unarmed or with natural attacks are also subject to this special attack.  Sleep Aura (Su) A sandman can radiate a 20-foot-radius sleep aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be affected as though by a sleep spell (caster level 8th). There is no limit to the number of Hit Dice a sandman can affect with this aura. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same sandman's sleep aura for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Str 17, Dex 8, Con -, Int 5, Wis 10, Cha 1	4	7	16 (20 vs. trip)	Numeria Land Of Fallen Stars	Fall to Pieces (Ex) Attacks and effects that deal more than 25% of a scrapyard robot's maximum hit points in damage (10 hit points for a standard scrapyard robot) impair one of the robot's components. Determine which subsystem randomly by rolling 1d6. If the subsystem has already been impaired, there is no further effect.  1 CPU: The robot is confused (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 566) 2 Fractured Plating: Reduce the robot's natural armor bonus by 3.  3 Power Core: Attacks against the robot with natural weapons, unarmed strikes, or metal weapons deal 1d6 points of electricity damage to the attacker, and the robot's slam attack deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage. The robot shuts down from power loss in 1d4+1 rounds.  4 Rotary Saw: The robot loses its rotary saw attack.  5 Servos: The robot's speed is reduced to 15 feet and its CMD against trip combat maneuvers is reduced by 8.  6 Sensors: The robot is blinded.  Repair (Ex) A scrapyard robot can use the inactive bodies of other robots to repair damage to itself. Doing so restores 10 hit points and removes one condition imparted by its fall to pieces ability per 8-hour period of uninterrupted work.  Eight hours of repair expends all salvageable parts from 1 Medium robot. For each size category a scrapped robot is above Medium, the scrapyard robot can perform another 8 hours of repairs using that robot's parts.  For each size category smaller than Medium scrapped robots are, the scrapyard robot requires twice as many robots to complete 8 hours of work.  Staggered (Ex) The poor construction of a scrapyard robot allows it to take only a single move or standard action each round. In effect, it always has the staggered condition. A scrapyard robot can move up to its speed and attack in the same round as a charge action.																												
Seaweed Leshy	3.00	800	Small	1	15, touch 12, flat-footed 14	30	6	2	3				20 ft., swim 20 ft.	slam +4 (1d6)	water jet +5 touch (1 plus blind)	5 ft.	5 ft.	sneak attack +1d6	Str 10, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 9, Wis 15, Cha 12	3	2	13	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Air Cyst (Su) Seaweed leshys constantly grow small bulbs filled with air. As a move action, they can detach a bulb and give it to another creature. If consumed as a standard action, this air cyst grants water breathing (as the spell) for 10 minutes. Seaweed leshys can have a maximum of four usable air cysts at any one time, and air cysts regrow at a rate of one per 24 hours.  Water Jet (Ex) A seaweed leshy can expel a high-pressure jet of water from its mouth to a range of 30 feet. It must make a ranged touch attack to strike  a target-if it hits, the blast deals 1 point of bludgeoning damage (this damage is not modified by Strength). In addition, the creature hit must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be blinded by the water for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Spit Venom (Ex) As a standard action, a seru can spit venom up to 30 feet. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment.

Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (dungeoneering) can use either of those skills instead of Perception to notice the ooze.  Cold Immunity (Ex) A sewer sludge hit by a cold-based attack takes no damage. However, if the amount of damage it would have otherwise taken exceeds its Constitution score, the sewer sludge is slowed (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds.  Disease (Ex) Filth fever: Slam-contact; save DC 17 Fort; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stench Aura (Ex) Creatures entering the area must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as they remain in the area and for 1d4 rounds after leaving it.

A creature reduced to Strength 0 dies. Trip (Ex) A shadow wolf can assume a corporeal form as a free action and bite (as a standard action) a foe in an attempt to trip the opponent. A shadow wolf that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the shadow wolf. Shadow wolves use their Dexterity modifier on trip attacks. The shadow wolf remains corporeal (i.e., it loses its incorporeal traits) for the entire round in which it attempts to trip an opponent. It can assume its incorporeal form on its next turn as a free action. Shadow Blend (Ex) In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow wolf can disappear into the shadows, giving it total concealment. Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not negate this ability; a daylight spell, however, will.																												
Shasalqu	3.00	800	Small	6	15, touch 13, flat-footed 13	30	6	6	2	heat absorption,			30 ft.	tail slap +6 (1d6+1 plus 1d6 cold)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 13, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 12	4	4	16 (20 vs. trip)	AP 79	Frigid Flesh (Ex) A creature that successfully hits a shasalqu with a natural attack or an unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of cold damage.  Heat Absorption (Ex) Fire deals no damage to a shasalqu. Instead, the shasalqu absorbs the fire and gains 1 temporary hit point for every 3 points of fire damage it would have taken. These temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour.  Trapping Cold (Su) A shasalqu exudes a heat-sapping aura that makes the air temperature around it plunge. Any creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of a shasalqu takes 1d6 points of cold damage and becomes entangled. A successful DC 13 Fortitude save negates the damage and the entangled condition. An affected creature is entangled for as long as it is within the aura's area plus 1 round after leaving. Other shasalqus are immune to this aura, as are any creatures immune to cold damage or whose cold resistance causes them to take no damage from the aura. When a shasalqu dies, its trapping cold aura persists around its corpse for 1 hour.																												
Sheet Fungus	3.00	800	Medium	3	17, touch 13, flat-footed 14	25	7	4	3				fly 40 ft.

It takes a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice a sheet fungus before it attacks.  Engulf (Ex) A sheet fungus can try to wrap a creature of its size or smaller in its body as a standard action. The sheet fungus attempts a grapple check that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and squeezes the engulfed prey dealing automatic slam damage each round the grapple is held.  Attacks that hit an engulfing sheet fungus deal half of their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.																												
Shulsaga	3.00	800	Medium	8	16, touch 14, flat-footed 12	22	1	8	7				30 ft., fly 60 ft.

The astral projecting creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or be snapped back to its body, ending the spell effect but not harming the spellcaster. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  Disk Rider (Su) A shulsaga can only use its fly speed in tandem with its floating disk spell-like ability. A shulsaga that casts floating disk can use the spell to its normal effect, or step upon it and use it to fly for the duration of the spell. The disk can support its creator and the creator's equipment (even if this exceeds the load a floating disk can normally bear), but nothing else. Only the disk's caster can ride it in this way. A floating disk cast by a shulsaga is dismissible.  Sense Rift (Su) As a standard action, a shulsaga can detect any planar rift within 20 miles, automatically learning its direction and distance. This includes natural portals, non-instantaneous planar spells such as gate, and other tears in reality.																												
Sirine Flower	3.00	800	Medium	4	15, touch 10, flat-footed 15	32	8	1	2				10 ft.	4 tendrils +6 (1d4+2 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	charming song, essence drain	Str 14, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 14	3	+5 (+9 grapple)	15	Tome of Horrors 4	Charming Song (Su) Sirine flowers emit a soothing and tranquil humming in a 60-foot radius that resembles music or birds singing. Those hearing the song must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become captivated by the sound. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same sirine flower's song for one day. A victim under the effects of this ability moves toward the sirine flower using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sirine flower simply stands and offers no resistance to the sirine flower's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the sirine flower sings and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus.  Essence Drain (Su) A grabbed creature takes normal damage plus 1d2 points of Intelligence damage each round until it escapes.

Profane Claws (Su) Any good-aligned creature hit by a skitterdark's claw attack takes normal damage plus 1d6 points of profane damage.																												
Skulleton	3.00	800	Tiny	0	14, touch 12, flat-footed 14	26	3	1	5				fly 10 ft.

Dust (Ex) The skulleton can use its crumbled remains to attack any creature that comes within 10 feet. Twice per day as a standard action, it can billow forth a cloud of dust that surrounds it in a 10-foot radius. Creatures caught within the area must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 6 rounds. The dust cloud remains for 2 rounds and can be affected by wind. The save DC is Charisma-based.

It takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the ooze. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version.  Disease (Ex) Fungal rot: Slam-contact; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day; effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Str damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Engulf (Ex) A slime mold can wrap a creature of up to one size smaller in its body as a standard action. If a slime mold succeeds a Combat Maneuver check to grapple an opponent, it establishes a hold and deals slam damage each round the hold is maintained. Attacks that hit an engulfing slime mold deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.																												
Slithering Tracker	3.00	800	Small	4	15, touch 11, flat-footed 14	47	6	1	1	sealed mind, transparent			10 ft., climb 10 ft.	slam +6 (1d4+3 plus paralysis)		5 ft.	5 ft.	engulf (paralysis and plasma drain), paralysis (1d4 hours, DC 17, also when struck by unarmed attacks or natural weapons), plasma drain	Str 14, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 1	3	+5 (+9 grapple)	19 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Engulf (Ex) A slithering tracker can engulf a paralyzed foe up to one size larger than itself as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The slithering tracker merely has to move into a space occupied by a paralyzed creature, completely covering it. An engulfed opponent is subjected to the slithering tracker's paralysis and plasma drain, and is considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. A slithering tracker only uses this ability against a paralyzed, sleeping, or otherwise helpless opponent. Plasma Drain (Ex) A slithering tracker drains the body fluids from an engulfed opponent. Each 5 minutes an opponent is engulfed, it takes 1 point of Constitution damage. Because it takes a long time to completely drain a foe, a slithering tracker generally only uses this ability against a paralyzed, stunned, held, or sleeping opponent. Sealed Mind (Ex) Even though a slithering tracker has an Intelligence score, it is immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) just as other oozes are. Transparent (Ex) A slithering tracker is hard to identify, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Perception check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a slithering tracker and walk into it are automatically hit with a slam attack and subjected to the creature's paralysis attack.																												
Slitherrat	3.00	800	Medium	3	14, touch 13, flat-footed 11	25	5	7	2				30 ft., burrow 30 ft.	bite +6 (1d6+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	diamond teeth	Str 10, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 4	3	3	16 (20 against trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Diamond Teeth (Ex) Because the teeth are so hard and sharp, a slitherrat's bite attack bypasses all hardness and deals 1d6+1 damage  Pass Through Crystal (Ex) Slitherrats may pass through crystal and similar gemstone-like materials as if they were not even present, leaving no trace of their passage.

Small Lightning Quasi-elemental	3.00	800	Small	4	19, touch 16, flat-footed 14	33	2	9	5			vulnerability to water	fly 60 ft. (perfect)	2 slams +9 (1d6 electricity)		5 ft.	5 ft.	electricity	Str 10, Dex 18, Con 10, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	6	5	20	Tome of Horrors Complete	Electricity (Ex) A lightning quasi-elemental is composed entirely of electricity and deals electricity damage each time it hits. A creature striking the lightning quasi-elemental unarmed, or a creature striking the lightning quasi-elemental with a weapon take this same electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. Metallic creatures or creatures using metal weapons take an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. Globe (Ex) As a standard action, a lightning quasi-elemental can discharge one globe of electricity per HD it possesses once per round. Globes hover by the quasi-elemental and move with the creature. An opponent that moves within 5 feet of a lightning quasi-elemental discharges a globe and takes the electricity damage shown on the table below. An affected creature can make a Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. Once a globe discharges, it is destroyed and a lightning quasi-elemental cannot recreate it for 4 hours. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A lightning quasi-elemental takes 1d8 points of damage per gallon of water it contacts. Pouring water onto a lightning quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level to a lightning quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against a lightning quasi-elemental.

Living creatures caught in the storm take 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half, caster level 6th).  This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Fast Healing (Ex) A smoke mephit heals only if it is exposed to smoke or soot (whether magically created or mundane in nature).  Sooty Breath (Su) Living creatures that fail their saves against the smoke mephit's breath weapon are tormented by burning eyes. This effect imposes a -4 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

Bleed damage is not multiplied for this attack.  Sucking Tentacles (Ex) A snallygaster uses its retractable tentacles to suck blood from its victim's bleeding wounds. If a target has a bleed effect and the snallygaster grabs it with tentacles or maintains a grapple against it, the target takes double the normal bleed damage at the beginning of its next turn. When the snallygaster is using its tentacles, it cannot make bite attacks.

When a spriggan becomes Large, his speed increases to 30 feet, he gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +6 Constitution, and he takes a -2 size penalty to his AC. While Large, a spriggan cannot use his sneak attack or his racial spell-like abilities (although if he possesses either from class levels or templates, he retains their use in both sizes).  Spriggan Magic (Ex) A spriggan gains a +1 racial bonus on concentration checks and to save DCs for all of its racial spell-like abilities.  Spriggan Skills (Ex) Climb, Disable Device, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth are class skills for spriggans.

(good)	mwk longsword +5 (1d8+2/19-20), mwk short sword +5 (1d6+1/19-20)	shortbow +6 (1d6/x3)	5 ft.	5 ft.	sneak attack +1d6	Str 14, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 10, Cha 9	4	6	18	Chronicle Of The Righteous	Hone Senses (Su) Three times per day, a spyglass archon can concentrate its attention as a swift action. For a number of rounds equal to its Hit Dice (4 for most spyglass archons), the range of the spyglass archon's darkvision is doubled, it gains a +6 bonus on Perception checks, and it gains blindsense out to a range of 15 feet.																												
Stench Kow	3.00	800	Large	0	17, touch 9, flat-footed 17	25	6	3	2				40 ft.	gore +6 (1d8+6)		10 ft.	5 ft.	powerful charge, trample (1d8+6, DC 15)	Str 18, Dex 10, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 4	3	8	18 (22 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Powerful Charge (Ex) On a successful charge attack, a stench kow deals double damage with its gore. This damage is tripled (not quadrupled) on a critical hit.																												
Stone Idol	3.00	800	Diminutive	-1	17, touch 13, flat-footed 17	19	1	0	3				10 ft.	bite +8 (1d4+1)		1 ft.	0 ft.	suggestive	Str 12, Dex 8, Con -, Int 7, Wis 14, Cha 14	3	-2	9	AP 27	Inanimate (Ex) An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise. Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.  Preserve Memory (Su) Any sentient creature with a Charisma of 14 or higher can copy one of its memories into a stone idol. To do so, the creature must remain in contact with a stone idol for 1 minute and concentrate on a memory to be duplicated.  This memory must be 5 minutes or shorter and be of an actual event; imaginings cannot be reproduced. After a memory has been duplicated, it remains in the stone idol until a new memory is recorded. A memory held by a stone idol can be altered via the spell modify memory.  A memory held within a stone idol can be viewed by any creature that comes into mental contact with the construct and by the use of detect thoughts, mind-reading effects, or similar abilities, even one redirected by its stony mind ability.  Share Abilities (Su) An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).  Skills In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.  Stony Mind (Su) Any divination spell targeting a creature or object within 30 feet of a stone idol instead targets the construct. Thus, for the purposes of any spell that reveals auras, those affected are treated as being under the effects of the spell misdirection, while spells like detect thoughts receive nothing more than vague impressions. Should detect thoughts or another mind-reading effect target a stone idol that contains a memory, the ability user instantly gains the memory held within.  Suggestive (Su) Those fascinated by a stone idol's animal trance or hypnotic pattern spell-like ability become highly susceptible to the suggestions of others nearby. Any creature can make a suggestion (as per the spell suggestion) to a fascinated creature, who must then make a DC 15 Will save or proceed to follow the suggestion. Any creature who makes a suggestion is understood by the fascinated creature, as per the spell tongues or speak with animals. A suggestion lasts for 1 hour, even if a creature is no longer being fascinated. A fascinated creature follows only the first suggestion it fails its saving throw against and no additional suggestions. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Strangle Weed	3.00	800	Large	0	14, touch 9, flat-footed 14	30	7	1	2	camouflage			swim 5 ft.	slam +7 (1d6+6 plus grab)		10 ft.	20 ft.	constrict (1d6+6), fronds	Str 18, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6	3	+8 (+12 grapple)	18 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Camouflage (Ex) Since a strangle weed looks like normal seaweed when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.  Fronds (Ex) Strangle weed attacks with fronds that can extend up to 20 feet from its central mass. Each strangle weed has 3-12 fronds. A strangle weed attacks with these fronds as a slam attack; although it can make only one attack per round, if it grapples a foe it is not denied its Dexterity bonus against non-grappled foes and can still make attacks of opportunity if it has any free fronds. Once a foe is grappled, the strangle weed can attempt to latch on 1-4 additional fronds each round as a standard action by means of a separate grapple check. Additional fronds attached to a foe do not do increased damage, but they do add a cumulative +2 bonus to the strangle weed's CMB on subsequent grapple checks against that foe. To free itself, the foe must succeed on a grapple check against every frond grappling it.																												
Stunjelly	3.00	800	Large	0	9, touch 9, flat-footed 9	42	7	1	-4	camouflage			10 ft.	slam +3 (1d6+1 plus 1d6 acid plus paralysis)		10 ft.	5 ft.	corrosion, engulf (DC 13, 1d6 acid and paralysis), paralysis (3d6 rounds, DC 18)	Str 12, Dex 10, Con 22, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	3	5	15(can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Acid (Ex) A stunjelly secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material quickly, but does not affect metal or stone. Any melee hit deals acid damage, and the opponent's clothing and armor (non-metal only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 18 Reflex save. A wooden weapon that strikes a stunjelly takes 1d6 acid damage unless it succeeds on a DC 18 Reflex save. If a stunjelly remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 18 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based. Camouflage (Ex) Since a stunjelly looks like normal stone when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (dungeoneering) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the stunjelly. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice a stunjelly. Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being engulfed by a stunjelly suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.																												
Sudoth	3.00	800	Medium	3	16, touch 13, flat-footed 13	26	3	4	5			Water dependant	5 ft., swim 30 ft.	2 slam +7 (1d6+4), spear +7 (1d8+4), tentacle +5 (1d8+2 plus paralysis)		5 ft.	5 ft.	paralysis (1d6 rounds, DC 14)	Str 18, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 8	3	7	20	Tome of Horrors Complete	Water Dependent (Ex) A sudoth can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning rules in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). Watersense (Ex) A sudoth can automatically pinpoint anything in contact with the water within 60 feet.																												
Swamp Troll	3.00	800	Large	2	16, touch 11, flat-footed 14	38	9	3	2			swamp dependent	30 ft., swim 30 ft.	bite +6 (2d6+4), 2 claws +6 (1d6+4)		10 ft.	10 ft.	rend (2 claws, 1d6+6)	Str 18, Dex 14, Con 20, Int 6, Wis 9, Cha 4	3	8	20	Tome of Horrors Complete	Swamp Dependent (Ex) Swamp trolls keep their bodies covered in a thick coating of mud and swamp water. Without such a coating, they lose their regeneration ability and eventually suffocate. They can survive away from their murky home for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, see the suffocation rules in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. They cannot regenerate while subject to suffocation from being away from their swamp for too long.																												
Swordtooth Shark	3.00	800	Large	5	16, touch 10, flat-footed 15	39	9	6	3				swim 60 ft.	bite +8 (2d6+8/18-20 plus bleed)		10 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (1d6, DC 15)	Str 19, Dex 12, Con 15, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2	4	9	20	Tome of Horrors 4	Keen Scent (Ex) A swordtooth shark can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.  Savage Bite (Ex) A swordtooth shark applies twice its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on an 18-20.																												
Tangtal	3.00	800	Medium	4	17, touch 14, flat-footed 13	22	5	7	15				40 ft.	bite +7 (1d6+3), 2 claws +7 (1d4+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 16, Dex 19, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 10	3	33	43 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Duplicate (Su) As a standard action, a tangtal can create an effect similar to a mirror image spell (caster level 12th).  This allows the tangtal to create up to eight images of itself.  The images can move up to 30 feet away from the tangtal, but each must be within 10 feet of another image. The tangtal can use this ability once per day and it otherwise resembles the mirror image spell.																												
Technic League Hireling	3.00	800	Medium	4	18, touch 14, flat-footed 14	25	5	9	7	evasion, trap sense +1, uncanny dodge			30 ft.	dagger +4 (1d4+1/19-20)	dagger +7 (1d4+1/19-20)	5 ft.	5 ft.	sneak attack +2d6	Str 13, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 14, Wis 8, Cha 10	3	6	21 (can't be tripped)	Numeria Land Of Fallen Stars	Black E-Pick (Ex) This electronic lockpick allows the user to attempt Disable Device checks against electronic devices and grants its user a +1 competence bonus on the check.  Thieves' tools do not apply to Disable Device checks against electronic devices. An e-pick has 10 charges; using the e-pick as part of a Disable Device check consumes one charge. An e-pick weighs 1 pound and is worth 100 gp.  Implanted Tracker Chip (Ex) This chip allows its carrier to be tracked remotely with a chipfinder (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide). Finding evidence of it requires a full-round search of the carrier and a successful DC 30 Perception check. Extracting the chip requires a slashing weapon and deals 1 point of damage to the carrier.																												
Tether	3.00	800	Small	3	15, touch 14, flat-footed 12	26	5	7	7				30 ft., climb 20 ft.	bite +8 (1d4-1), 2 claws +8 (1d3-1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	energy drain (1 level, DC 14), fascination	Str 8, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 14	4	21	35	Tome of Horrors Complete	Energy Drain (Su) Each hour a tether remains within 20 feet of a creature it has fascinated, it deals one negative level to him or her. Fascination (Su) Will DC 14.																												
Thorny	3.00	800	Medium	2	17, touch 12, flat-footed 15	26	6	3	4				50 ft.	bite +5 (1d6+3 plus trip)		5 ft.	5 ft.	thorns	Str 14, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6	3	2	16	Tome of Horrors Complete	Thorns (Ex) A thorny's body is covered with sharp wooden thorns. Any creature attacking a thorny with a non-reach melee weapon or with natural attacks takes 1d4+2 points of piercing damage from the thorny's sharp thorns. A creature that grapples with a thorny takes this same damage each round.																												
Tidepool Dragon	3.00	800	Tiny	5	15, touch 13, flat-footed 14	30	5	7	1				10 ft., fly 30 ft. (average), swim 60 ft.	bite +6 (1d3), 2 claws +6 (1d3 plus attach)		2-1/2 ft.	0 ft.	breath weapon (5-ft. line, 2d6 fire damage, Reflex DC 13 for half, usable every 1d4 rounds)	Str 11, Dex 13, Con 13, Int 8, Wis 14, Cha 14	4	1	14	AP 55	Attach (Ex) When a tidepool dragon hits with a claw attack, it automatically grapples its foe, dealing automatic damage with that claw each round.  Breath Weapon (Su) When a tidepool dragon uses its breath weapon underwater, it creates a 10-foot cone of superheated water rather than a line of fire (as noted above). This effect deals the breath weapon's damage to any creatures in the cone's area, though victims can still save to take only half damage.																												
Tikoloshe	3.00	800	Small	2	15, touch 13, flat-footed 13	26	2	3	3	channel resistance +2, water diffusion		blind	20 ft., swim 30 ft., waverider	bite +6 (1d4+2), 2 slams +6 (1d3+2)		5 ft.	5 ft.	trickster's torment	Str 14, Dex 15, Con -, Int 8, Wis 15, Cha 13	3	4	18 (22 vs. trip)	AP 40	Blind A tikoloshe has no eyes and is blind. All creatures beyond the range of its hearing-based blindsense and blindsight abilities have total concealment against it. Trickster's Torment (Su) Once per day, a tikoloshe can curse another living creature. As a standard action, the tikoloshe makes a melee touch attack and unless the target makes a DC 15 Will save, the target is treated as if under the effect of bestow curse, except that the curse's duration is only 24 hours. A creature can only suffer from one tikoloshe's curse at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based. Water Diffusion (Ex) When in water at least 2 feet deep, a tikoloshe's body seems to diffuse into and become part of the water, granting it concealment (20% miss chance) as if under the effect of blur. This effect ends immediately upon entering shallower water or setting foot on land. Waverider (Ex) Up to 3 times per day, a tikoloshe can swim up to 30 feet as a swift action. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity for this movement.																												
Trollhound	3.00	800	Medium	5	15, touch 11, flat-footed 14	30	6	5	2				40 ft.	bite +8 (1d10+6 plus disease and trip)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 18, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 6	4	+9 (+11 grapple)	18 (20 vs. grapple)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Disease (Ex) A trollhound's saliva is an infectious brew of contagion. Creatures bitten by a trollhound are often afflicted with bloodfire fever, a disease characterized by deep internal pain, as if the victim's blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscular coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Trolls and trollhounds alike are immune to bloodfire fever, even though trollhounds often exhibit the pus-filled blisters that come with the disease.  Bloodfire fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Str damage, 1d3 Dex damage, and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

(5 ft. with spear)	sneak attack +2d6, splinterspray	Str 8, Dex 16, Con 15, Int 11, Wis 14, Cha 13	2	3	12	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Bramble Jump (Su) A twigjack can travel short distances between brambles, shrubs, or thickets as if via dimension door as part of a move action. The twigjack must begin and end this movement while in an area of at least light undergrowth. The twigjack can travel in this manner up to 60 feet per day. This movement must be used in 10-foot increments and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  Splinterspray (Ex) A twigjack can eject a barrage of splinters and brambles from its body three times per day as a standard action. This effect creates a 15-foot conical burst of jagged splinters, dealing 4d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures in the area. A DC 14 Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Unicorn	3.00	800	Large	3	15, touch 12, flat-footed 12	34	7	7	6				60 ft.	gore +8 (1d8+4), 2 hooves +5 (1d3+2)		10 ft.	5 ft.	powerful charge (gore, 2d8+8)	Str 18, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 11, Wis 21, Cha 24	4	9	22 (26 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary	Magic Circle against Evil (Su) This ability continually duplicates the effect of the spell. The unicorn cannot suppress this ability.  Magical Strike (Ex) A unicorn's gore attack is treated as a magic good weapon for the purposes of damage reduction.  Wild Empathy (Su) This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except the unicorn has a +6 racial bonus on the check. Unicorns with druid levels add this racial modifier to their wild empathy checks.																												
Urdefhan	3.00	800	Medium	1	16, touch 11, flat-footed 15	25	6	4	4	negative energy affinity	14		30 ft.	rhoka sword +8 (1d8+6/18-20), bite +2 (1d4+2 plus 2 Str) or  bite +7 (1d4+4 plus 2 Str)	composite longbow +4 (1d8+4/x3)	5 ft.	5 ft.	blood drain (1 Con)	Str 19, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 14,  Wis 13, Cha 14	3	7	18	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Daemonic Pact (Su) Urdefhans are infused with daemonic energy; as an immediate action, an urdefhan can attempt to allow this energy to consume its soul (50% chance of success per attempt). If it succeeds, the urdefhan dies and releases a 5-foot-radius burst of negative energy that deals 2d6 points of damage (DC 14 Reflex half). The save DC is Con-based.  Strength Damage (Su) An urdefhan's bite drains vitality, turning the skin and muscle around the wound transparent and causing 2 points of Strength damage unless the target succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save. The flesh remains transparent until the Strength damage is healed, but this does not have any other effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Valeany	3.00	800	Medium	4	18, touch 15, flat-footed 13	22	3	8	6				30 ft.	mwk dagger +7 (1d4/19-20) or touch +6 (mark) or unarmed +6 (1d3 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	embrace	Str 10, Dex 19, Con 15, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 19	2	+2 (+6 grapple)	17	Tome of Horrors 4	Embrace (Su) A valeany that grapples and pins a foe deals 1d4 points of Strength damage to the target each round the pin is maintained.  Mark (Su) A valeany can "mark" an opponent that instills distrust in all animals. No animal, wild or domesticated, approaches within 30 feet of a marked foe; if forced to do so, the creature panics and remains so as long as it's within 30 feet of the target. The mark can be removed by a break enchantment or dispel magic (the latter of which must be cast by a spellcaster whose caster level is equal to or higher than the valeany's Hit Dice). Dryads, druids, and valeanys can sense a marked creature within 60 feet.  Nature's Empathy (Su) This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy class feature, except the valeany has a +4 racial bonus on the check. The valeany's effective druid level is equal to her Hit Dice for determining her total modifier to the check.																												
Vampire Rose	3.00	800	Small	0	17, touch 11, flat-footed 17	30	7	1	2	camouflage			5 ft.	stalk +6 (1d4+2 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.

Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version.																												
Vampiric Mist	3.00	800	Medium	8	14, touch 14, flat-footed 10	30	4	5	5	amorphous		vulnerable to fire	fly 50 ft. (perfect)	touch +7 (bleed and blood siphon)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (1d6)	Str -, Dex 19, Con 16, Int 7, Wis 13, Cha 10	3	-	-	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Blood Siphon (Ex) A vampiric mist drains blood with each melee touch attack dealing 1d3 points of Constitution damage. Every time a vampiric mist damages a creature in this way, it heals 1d8 hit points. Hit points healed in excess of its maximum are gained as temporary hit points, to a maximum amount equal to its Constitution score. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.  Blood Overdose (Su) When a vampiric mist gorges on blood to an extent that it gains temporary hit points, it moves much more quickly. It gains a +2 bonus to its Armor Class and on Reflex saves, and can take one additional move action each round.  Misty Form (Ex) A vampiric mist's body is composed of a semisolid red mist similar in consistency to thick foam. The vampiric mist does not have a Strength score, and it cannot manipulate or wear solid objects. This form grants it the amorphous defensive ability, and allows it to move through areas as small as 1 inch in diameter with no reduction to its speed. The creature can speak in a hissing voice. A vampiric mist cannot enter water or other fluids, and is treated as a creature two size categories smaller than its actual size (Tiny for most vampiric mists) for the purposes of how wind affects it.  Sense Blood (Ex) A vampiric mist can immediately sense the presence of warm-blooded creatures in a 60-foot radius as if by scent. It can detect exposed blood within a mile.																												
Vegepygmy Bodyguard	3.00	800	Small	2	16, touch 13, flat-footed 14	37	6	3	2				30 ft.	2 claws +6 (1d3+2) or spear +7 (1d6+3 /x3)	spear +7 (1d6+2/x3)	5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 15, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 12	3	4	16	Tome of Horrors Complete

Vermlek	3.00	800	Medium	-1	15, touch 9, flat-footed 15	30	8	0	5	abandon flesh, flesh armor, negative energy affinity	14		30 ft., burrow 20 ft.	longsword +6 (1d8+2/19-20), bite +1 (1d6+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	inhabit body	Str 15, Dex 9, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 12	4	+6 (+10 grapple)	15	Book of the Damned V2	Abandon Flesh (Su) As a swift action, a vermlek can abandon an inhabited body, crawling hideously out of its host and leaving behind an empty sack of skin and bits of gristle. In so doing, it absorbs much of the body's flesh to heal itself, restoring 2d6+3 hit points. A vermlek cannot later reclaim this body with its inhabit body ability.  Flesh Armor (Su) When a vermlek wears a humanoid body (see inhabit body, below), it treats the dead flesh and muscle as armor and gains a +3 armor bonus to its AC.  Inhabit Body (Su) A vermlek can crawl into the body of any dead Medium humanoid, consuming and replacing the bulk of the humanoid's skeleton and internal organs as it does so. This process takes 1d4 rounds for the vermlek to complete, during which it is considered flat-footed.  Once the process is complete, the vermlek appears for all practical purposes to be a living but hideously obese version of the previous humanoid-it gains a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a normal humanoid while wearing a dead body in this manner, but does not gain any of the abilities that the dead creature possessed in life, including natural attacks, unusual movement types, or bonuses to natural armor. It loses its own burrow speed while inhabiting a body, but gains the ability to wield weapons or wear armor shaped for humanoids (although note that the armor bonus granted by wearing armor does not stack with the bonus granted by the vermlek's flesh armor ability).  Negative Energy Affinity (Ex) A vermlek is healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy as if it were an undead creature.

This hideous affliction causes 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Wax Golem	3.00	800	Medium	-1	15, touch 9, flat-footed 15	42	1	0	1			vulnerable to fire	30 ft.	slam +6 (1d6+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 14, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	4	6	15	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Conditional Sentience (Su) A wax golem constructed to look like a humanoid (whether a particular individual or not) has a small chance of gaining sentience and genuinely believing it is a living creature. Each week, such a wax golem has a cumulative 1% chance of becoming sentient (on the second week the chance is 2%, the third week 3%, and so on), to a maximum of 5%. If it does attain sentience, the golem gains an Intelligence score of 10, retroactive skill points, feats dependent on its Hit Dice, and 1 class level with the potential to gain more. If it was crafted to resemble a specific individual, it also gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate that individual. A sentient wax golem ventures into the world and tries to live a life similar to that of the person (or type of person) it resembles. However, if the sentient wax golem ever encounters the person it is modeled after, it attempts to stealthily kill that person and take her place. The only way for a sentient wax golem to lose its sentience is either to take an amount of fire damage equal to half its hit points (which melts its features away) or to be destroyed.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A wax golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that have the fire descriptor. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals fire damage slows a wax golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). In addition, for 3 rounds after taking fire damage, every time a wax golem uses its slam attack, it deals an additional 1d4 points of fire damage due to its molten wax. • A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A wax golem gains no saving throw against cold effects.

Creatures affected must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or be affected by fear (CL 5th). Creatures that save are unaffected by the same wichtlein's fear for one day. Creatures with 6 or more HD are not affected by this fear. The save is Charisma-based.  Limited Precognition (Su) Wichtlein are immediately aware of upcoming danger, so long as the hazard is not deliberately created by an intelligent creature. Thus, a wichtlein could sense a coming cave-in, or the approach of a bestial monster, but not a raiding party of drow or a miner planning a murder. A wichtlein can sense this danger 3d10 minutes before it occurs, and always attempts to warn any other intelligent creatures within the area.  Earth Glide (Ex) A wichtlein can move through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water. It leaves no sign of its passage or hint at its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a wichtlein moves the witchlein back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. A wichtlein moving through stone cannot pick up or carry anything it finds within the stone; thus, they still spend a great deal of their time mining.

Spawn so created are less powerful than typical wights, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, as well as -2 hp per HD. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become fullfledged and free-willed wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.

Spit (Ex) Once per hour, a wolliped can regurgitate the contents of its stomach, spitting the foul material at a single target within 10 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This is a sonic mindaffecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same hound's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Flight (Su) A yeth hound can cease or resume its flight as a free action.  Sinister Bite (Su) A yeth hound's bite is treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, a good-aligned creature bitten by a yeth hound must make a DC 14 Will save or be shaken for 1 round. If the victim is already suffering from a fear effect (such as the hound's bay attack), the victim is instead completely overcome with fear and can do nothing but cower for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Creatures entering or within the area must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or become nauseated for as long as they remain in the area plus 1d4 rounds after. Creatures succeeding on their save are immune to the effects of the aura for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Disease (Ex) Stygian Sickness: Bite; save DC 14 Fort; onset 1day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Intelligence and 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who dies while infected rises as a zombyre in 2d6 hours. The save is Charisma-based.  Staggered (Ex) Zombyres have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or standard action each round. A zombyre can move up to its speed and attack in the same round as a charge action. This flaw only affects zombyres when on land; while underwater, in combat, a zombyre loses this flaw.  Stygian Healing (Su) A zombyre regains 1 hit point each hour when fully submerged in the River Styx. This healing cannot restore more hit points than the maximum the zombyre possesses and it does not restore any lost limbs.																												
Abandoned One	4.00	1200	Medium	6	17, touch 12, flat-footed 15	37	4	3	7				30 ft.	2 claws +7 (1d8+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	curse of oblivion, forgotten friend	Str 16, Dex 14, Con -, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 17	3	6	18	Tears At Bitter Manor	Curse of Oblivion (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, an abandoned one can cause one creature within 60 feet to disappear (Will DC 15 negates). Living creatures treat the victim as invisible and can't hear its voice. This is a curse effect and lasts for 12 hours or until the abandoned one is destroyed, whichever comes first. Only creatures that are within 100 feet of the target when the abandoned one uses this ability are unable to see and hear the target, and they remain unable to do so even if they go outside of this range. The target remains invisible for the entire duration, even if it attacks or takes other actions that would normally cause an invisible creature to become visible. It can speak and cast spells as normal, but only the abandoned one can hear its vocalizations. The target remains tangible, and can be detected by scent, touch, or the sound of its movement. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Forgotten Friend (Su) When an abandoned one successfully uses its curse of oblivion, any creature within 100 feet of the cursed creature that has prior knowledge of it must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or lose all memory of the target's existence for the duration of that ability's effect, and ignore or explain away all evidence of the target's existence. Whether or not it succeeds at the save, a creature can only be affected by this ability once per day. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Selective Invisibility (Sp) This ability functions as invisibility (CL 5th), but doesn't end when the abandoned one attacks a creature. Instead, any creature the abandoned one attacks can see through the abandoned one's invisibility for 1 hour.

The bishop can use this aura as a free action, and any creature within this area must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become shaken for 5d6 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the bishop's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  Stunning Strike (Ex) Five times per day, a bishop can stun a creature it hits with a claw attack. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.

Any creature under the effects of protection from evil is immune to an aghash's gaze. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Sandstorm (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, an aghash can create a temporary sandstorm. This storm has a radius of 100 feet centered on the aghash and lasts for 1 minute per Hit Die the aghash possesses (typically 5). This functions as a sandstorm (Core Rulebook 431).

Str 17, Dex 13, Con 16, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 13	4	6	17	AP 79	Integrated Body (Ex) An ahkhat has no true body. It instead derives its form from the structure it inhabits, emerging from the walls, floors, and ceilings as an extension of the structure. An ahkhat cannot manifest from broken areas of a structure or separate from the building's surface at any time; it can only move within the building materials of the structure it's attuned to. An ahkhat occupies the same space as whatever area of the structure it is presently manifesting from.  If an ahkhat is, for whatever reason, moved 10 or more feet away from its structure, it takes 1d8 points of damage; at the beginning of its next turn, the ahkhat immediately returns to the nearest space within its structure as a free action. If an ahkhat is killed, its manifested body disappears as it's immediately reabsorbed by its attuned structure. When not manifesting from a structure, an ahkhat can't be attacked normally, but it is instantly destroyed if 75% of its attuned building is destroyed. If an ahkhat's keystone (see the Ahkhat Keystones on page 81.) is destroyed, the ahkhat is instantly destroyed.  Repair Structure (Sp) This functions like make whole, except this ability is strictly limited to the structure the ahkhat inhabits and permanent fixtures attached to the structure. For example, walls, doors, cabinets, and portcullises could be repaired with this ability, but not furniture or an adventurer's equipment.  Structural Mobility (Su) An ahkhat can move through solid walls, floors, and ceilings of any material except metal. Its movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripples or other signs of its passage. It cannot move through significantly damaged or ruined sections of a structure until they are repaired. If an area containing an ahkhat is targeted with a passwall spell or similar effect, the ahkhat takes 1d8 points of damage and is immediately shunted to the nearest available space in its attuned structure.

Communication with non-intelligent bird creatures is on an empathic level, and can only take place if the bird is within 100 feet of the ahlinni. In these cases, this ability functions as speak with animals (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated. The ahlinni can restart it as a free action on its next turn.  Impale (Ex) When an ahlinni charges a foe, it deals double damage on a successful strike with its bite attack.

If the stones leave the psychopomp's square or the ahmuuth is slain, they become inert stone. Death's Dagger (Su) An ahmuuth's dagger is treated as a +1 returning undead-bane dagger. It loses this ability if it is held by anyone other than the ahmuuth, and regains it once returned. Ectoplasmic Focus (Su) An ahmuuth's spells and spelllike abilities have their full effect against incorporeal or ethereal creatures.

It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter, it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights using the stats below. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the algoid that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. This ability is otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 10th). Mind Blast (Sp) Once per day, an algoid can use a mind blast in a 60-foot cone. Any creature caught in the cone must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Any living creature that enters this area loses the benefit of all bardic performances affecting it and takes a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and Will saving throws.  The attic whisperer can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action.  This aura is a sonic, mindaffecting effect.  Steal Breath (Su) A creature bit by an attic whisperer must make a DC 16 Will save or become fatigued for 1 hour.  A fatigued creature that is bitten is instead exhausted for 1 hour, and an exhausted creature falls asleep for 1 hour if bitten.

Steal Voice (Su) Any creature hit by an attic whisperer's touch must make a DC 16 Will save or lose its ability to speak for 1 hour. During that time, the creature cannot talk, cast spells with verbal components, use auditory bardic performances, or use any other ability that requires speech.  Once an attic whisperer has stolen a creature's voice, it can perfectly mimic that voice at any time, even after its victim's voice has returned, and while using that voice can speak any languages the victim knew. Those familiar with an individual's voice can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the attic whisperer's Bluff check to realize a mimicked voice is inauthentic. The save DC is Charisma-based.

They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.  Insanity Gaze (Su): Anyone with 30 feet that meets a barrow wight's gaze is affected as if by an insanity spell. A successful DC 14 Will save negates the effect and renders the target immune to the same barrow wight's insanity gaze for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead spell cast on a barrow wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.

Bonestripping (Ex) A bone cobbler can rapidly strip all the flesh from a Medium creature in 3 minutes using its claws and hammers. For each size category larger than Medium a corpse is, add 1 minute to the time it takes the bone cobbler to strip the corpse.

Once stripped, the bone cobbler devours the flesh and collects the victim's bones to use in its "sculptures".  A creature slain in this manner can only be brought back to life by a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell.  Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex) In combination with its natural abilities, a bone cobbler's Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with both of its weapons at no penalty to attack or damage.

Roar (Su) When a bunyip roars, all creatures with 4 or less HD within a 100-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mindaffecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the roar of that bunyip for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vorpal Bite (Ex) If a bunyip scores a natural 20 on its attack roll and confirms the critical hit, it severs one of the opponent's extremities (roll 1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left).

Anytime a calathgar is subjected to cold damage, it regains 1 hit point (regardless of the amount of cold damage dealt). When in areas of severe cold (such as arctic regions or near brown mold), a calathgar gains fast healing 1. Mold Mulch (Ex) Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a calathgar withers and swiftly decays, transforming into a 5-foot patch of brown mold. If a calathgar is killed by fire, the mold immediately grows into a 10-foot patch. If it is killed in a space already occupied by brown mold, that mold patch doubles in size just as though fire had been brought near. The area within 30 feet of brown mold is cold enough to activate a calathgar's cold healing and the persistent effect of its seed spray. Brown mold deals 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. See page 416 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for additional details.

This grants the cave troll a +1 bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves (both already figured into the stat block above). Any condition that makes the cave troll lose its Dexterity bonus to AC also makes it lose its dodge bonus. This is an inherent bonus and cannot be dispelled or negated. When making a full attack action, a cave troll can make one extra attack with any weapon it is holding or one extra claw attack (if using natural weapons). The extra attack is at the cave troll's full attack bonus. Spider Climb (Su) A cave troll can climb sheer surfaces as though by a spider climb spell (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated or dispelled. The cave troll can restart it again on its next turn as a free action.

In this form, a chalkost retains its damage reduction and energy resistances. The copper boar has the same statistics as a normal boar, but its natural armor bonus is +6 and its gore attack deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit.  Dwarf Blood (Ex) A chalkost counts as a dwarf for any effect related to race, and has the hardy, slow and steady, and stability dwarven racial traits.  Shock Cestus (Su) As a free action, a chalkost can summon or dismiss a masterwork cestus on one of its hands.

If the creature killed is of one of the following classes or creature types, the chemosit gains the associated benefit. If the creature killed falls into multiple categories, the chemosit chooses a single benefit to gain. With the exception of healing, the effects provided by this ability affect a chemosit for a number of minutes equal to 5 times its Hit Dice. Animal: The chemosit regains a number of hit points equal to the victim's Hit Dice, and the DC of its terrifying roar increases by +2. Arcane Spell-Caster: The chemosit regains a number of hit points equal to 1d4 times the victim's Hit Dice and gains SR 15. Divine Spell-Caster: The chemosit regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 times the victim's Hit Dice. Humanoid: The chemosit regains a number of hit points equal to 1d4 times the victim's Hit Dice. Outsider: The chemosit regains a number of hit points equal to 1d4 times the victim's Hit Dice but is confused for 1d4 rounds.

Terrifying Roar (Su) The terrifying roar of the chemosit unnerves even the bravest souls. Any creatures within a 300-foot spread must make a DC 15 Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear affect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same chemosit's roar for the next 24 hours. The save DC is Wisdom-based.																												
Chrystone	4.00	1200	Medium	-1	15, touch 9, flat-footed 15	42	1	0	3	shatter weapons			20 ft.	longsword +7 (1d8+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	death throes	Str 17, Dex 9, Con -, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 1	4	7	16	Tome of Horrors Complete	Death Throes (Ex) When a chrystone is destroyed, it shatters, spraying razor-sharp fragments from its form. Creatures within 5 feet of the chrystone take 2d6 points of damage. A DC 12 Reflex saving throw halves the damage. A chrystone can prevent itself from shattering by making a DC 12 Will save as it is destroyed. Spell-like Abilities (Sp) Three times per day, a chrystone can use its stone shape to repair itself, healing 1d6 points of damage per use. This requires a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The save DC for the chrystone's color spray includes a +2 racial bonus. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A chrystone is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell slows a chrystone (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the chrystone's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round. Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character strikes a chrystone with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or shatter into pieces. A magic weapon uses its own save bonus or that of the wielder, whichever is higher. If the weapon breaks, the chrystone takes no damage from the attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Cimota	4.00	1200	Medium	7	18, touch 13, flat-footed 15	47	6	4	6	channel resistance +2, displacement, unholy existence	12		fly 60 ft. (good)	2 claws +6 (1d6+3/19-20)		5 ft.	5 ft.	manifestation	Str 16, Dex 16, Con -, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 21	3	6	19	Tome of Horrors 4	Displacement (Su) Cimota manifest on the Prime Material Plane as a shifting cloud of shadows that coalesce into their cloaked and hooded forms. On any round that a cimota first manifests (see below), its shifting forms affect it as a displacement spell. Attacks on a cimota at this time have a 50% miss chance as if the cimota had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, this displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting a cimota normally. This effect is canceled one round after a cimota manifests, or if a cimota takes any action in its new locale.  Lifesense (Su) A cimota notices and locates living creatures within 60 ft., just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Manifestation (Su) As a standard action, a cimota can transport itself via planar travel from any point on the Prime Material Plane to another point within its defined area, or within 300 ft. of the artifact to which it is bound. A cimota may also lurk on the Negative Material Plane, prepared to manifest on the Prime Material if certain conditions are met, such as trespassers entering the area they are doomed to guard. A cimota cannot attack or move in the same round in which it manifests, although it may manifest as partial surprise action before initiative. A cimota benefits from displacement (see above) on the round in which it first manifests.  Unholy Existence (Su) Although it is possible to temporarily destroy a cimota's physical form, it will return in 1d6 days, manifesting again to continue its unholy existence. The only way to permanently destroy a cimota is to disrupt its existence by consecrating the ground to which it is tied or the destruction of the artifact to which it is bound. Sometimes, significant alteration of an unholy place, such as demolition of an evil temple or burning a haunted forest, could cause cimota to fade away permanently. Although their physical forms may be damaged by normal attacks, their unholy existence grants them SR 17. Because cimota exist partially on the Negative Material Plane they are subject to banishment or other spells that affect outsiders.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals do not willingly approach within 30 ft. of a cimota unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. This aura takes effect when a cimota manifests on the Prime Material Plane. Animals that come within 30 ft. of a place where cimota are lurking on the Negative Material Plane, or an artifact to which a cimota is bound; Will be uneasy and show signs of disquiet.

This ability is inherent and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.  Sound Mimicry (Ex) A clamor can duplicate any sound it has ever encountered with perfect accuracy as a free action. It can use this ability to duplicate speech, music, or any other auditory phenomenon, although sounds with magical properties (such as power word spells) lose their magical effects when duplicated.  Sonic Burst (Ex) A clamor can emit a massive onslaught of sonic energy as a full-round action that can be heard for miles in all directions. Any living creature within 100 feet of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Furthermore, living creatures within 50 feet of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be permanently deafened. A restoration, wish, miracle, or remove blindness/deafness spell restores hearing and negates the stunning effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Speed of Sound (Ex): Once per day, a clamor can move at the speed of sound for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Its fly speed increases to 6,820 ft. (34,100 squares), but it cannot attack or use of any of its other abilities when moving this way.  Sound-Related Vulnerabilities (Ex) Any magical silence effect or effect that creates a vacuum deals 3d6 points of damage to a clamor and forces it to make a successful Fortitude save (DC equal to 10 + spell level + spell caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or become panicked for 1 minute. In addition, the following spells can affect a clamor in unusual ways.  Ghost sound, major image, minor image, message, ventriloquism, whispering wind: These magically generated + spell level + the caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or act as though affected by a confusion spell for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level.  Sculpt sound: If targeted directly at the clamor, this spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level. The clamor is allowed a Fortitude save for half damage. Alternately, a bard (and only a bard) using sculpt sound can attempt to completely control the actions of a clamor. The clamor is allowed an initial Fortitude save to negate the effect; if it fails, it is controlled as if by a dominate monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the bard's class level.  Shout, sound burst: These spells do no damage to a clamor, but force it to make a Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the caster.

Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If a clockwork swarm takes damage from an area attack, it is unable to repair itself for 1d6 rounds following the attack. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects) until it has at least 1 hit point (at which time it begins to self-repair at its normal rate of 3 hit points per round).

The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Poison Aura (Ex) A cobalt viper's poison is so potent, that it exudes it in an aura around its body. A creature that starts its turn within the area is subjected to the cobalt viper's poison. The poison from this aura is weaker than its bite however, and deals only 1 point of Con damage (instead of 1d3 Con damage).

Any electricity resistance blocks this effect unless the target willingly submits. Otherwise the flames persist until the wyrd is out of range. Targets of this effect take a -10 penalty on Stealth checks. A comozant wyrd can communicate empathically with creatures subject to this effect, and gains a +4 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks when doing so. Interacting with a wyrd in this way still uses standard social skills and rules. While communicating this way, a comozant can confer unexpected insight or information equivalent to a divination spell.  Lightning Lash (Su) As a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a comozant wyrd can shock any creature or object within 30 feet to which it has line of effect, dealing 2d8 electricity damage. The wyrd can choose for this damage to be nonlethal. If the target is also affected by the wyrd's illuminating flames, it is stunned for 1 round (Fortitude DC 16 negates) and the flames are dispelled. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Plasma Form (Ex) Although incorporeal, a comozant wyrd can't hide inside solid objects. It must start its turn attached to the outside of something that's solid and of Small size or larger, or else it takes 5 points of damage.

Each slam and constrict attack deals 1d6 additional acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a crystal ooze takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes a crystal ooze takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The ooze's touch deals 12 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. Transparency (Ex) Due to its lack of vivid coloration, a crystal ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. A DC 15 Perception check is required to notice the ooze. Any creature that fails to notice a crystal ooze and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the ooze's slam attack and is immediately subject to a grab attempt by the ooze. Water Dependency (Ex) Crystal oozes can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 4 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning rules in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook).

Savage Bite (Ex) A devilfish can attack with its savage bite whenever it makes a successful grapple check. This attack is in place of any other action made with a successful grapple check. The bite threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20, and injects the target with poison as well.  Unholy Blood (Su) A devilfish's blood is infused with fiendish magic. Once per day, as a swift action, a devilfish can emit a night-black cloud of this foul liquid, filling a 20-foot-radius cloud if underwater, or a 20-foot-radius burst on land. In water, the blood provides total concealment for everything but a devilfish (which can see through the blood with ease); on land the slippery blood coats the ground, making the area difficult terrain. The blood persists for 1 minute before fading. Anyone who enters a cloud of the blood in the water or who is within the area of a burst of blood on land must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds-this save need be made only once per cloud. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Water Dependency (Ex) A devilfish can survive out of the water for 1 hour, after which it becomes fatigued. After 2 hours, the devilfish becomes exhausted and begins to suffocate (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445).

Str 12, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 15	3	-5	5	Tome of Horrors 4	Size Alteration (Su) At will as a standard action, a dobie can change its size between Medium and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the dobie's person grow proportionally when it changes sizes (objects revert to normal size one round after a dobie releases them). When a dobie becomes Large, its speed increases to 40 feet, it gains +6 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +4 Constitution, and takes a -1 size penalty to AC.  A dobie can use this ability only in its natural environment. If a dobie leaves its natural environment while enlarged, it immediately reverts to its normal size. Additionally, an enlarged dobie that takes 10 points of fire damage or more from a single fire effect immediately reverts to its normal size. It cannot enlarge itself again for 3 rounds after being hit by a fire effect.																												
Domovoi	4.00	1200	Small	4	18, touch 15, flat-footed 14	26	3	8	1		15		30 ft., climb 20 ft.	short sword +7 (1d4+1), bite +2 (1d4) or 2 claws +7 (1d3+1 plus grab), bite +7 (1d4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	sneak attack (2d6), telekinesis	Str 13, Dex 18, Con 15, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 13	2	1	9 (13 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Knocker Spirit (Su) A domovoi killed by violence rises in 1 hour as a poltergeist.  Telekinesis (Su) As a standard action once per turn, a domovoi can use telekinesis. This ability functions as the telekinesis spell with a CL equal to the domovoi's Hit Dice (CL 4th for most domovoi). A typical domovoi has a ranged attack roll of +5 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures, and can use this ability on objects or creatures of up to 75 pounds. If a domovoi attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 13 Will save. The save DC is Strength-based.

All creatures that can hear the doombat's shriek (except other doombats) within a 100-ft. radius must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. Successive shrieks do not stack with each other but do extend the duration of the effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same doombat's shriek for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Yip (Ex) A doombat yips constantly while in combat.  The noise interferes with an opponent's ability to focus on difficult tasks. Spellcasters within 100 ft. of a yipping doombat must succeed on a concentration check (DC 15 + spell's level) anytime they attempt to cast a spell.  The effect of several doombats yipping at once is not cumulative.																												
Draug	4.00	1200	Medium	2	17, touch 12, flat-footed 15	38	5	3	3	channel resistance +2			30 ft., swim 30 ft.	cutlass +6 (1d6+2/19-20) or 2 claws +5 (1d4+2)		5 ft.	5 ft.	call storm	Str 14, Dex 15, Con -, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 14	3	5	15	Tome of Horrors Complete	Call Storm (Su) Once per day, a draug can summon inclement weather to harass its opponents. The effects are felt immediately (i.e., there is no gradual shift in the weather). Otherwise, this ability is identical to the control weather spell (caster level 6th). Control Ship (Su) A draug has full control over its vessel (wind notwithstanding) so long as it remains at the wheel or within 20 feet of the helmsman. Should it leave the area, its ship meanders in a random direction until the draug regains control. A draug also imbues its ship with special abilities (see Draug Ships, below).

Str -, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 17, Cha 16	5	+28 (+32 grapple)	38 (50 vs. trip)	Daughters Of Fury	Aura of Fate (Su) A dunagh merged with or within 120 feet of its ward radiates an aura of fate to a radius of 20 feet. Enemies within this aura must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack, a skill check, or a saving throw) and take the lower of the two results. Allies designated by the dunagh in this aura likewise roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll, but can take the higher result instead. This is a mind-affecting morale effect that doesn't work on fey. A dunagh can suppress and reactivate this aura at will as a free action.  Dunagh's Curse (Su) Any creature touched by a dunagh must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be afflicted with the dunagh's curse. Whenever the cursed creature rolls a d20, it treats any roll of 20 as a roll of 1 instead. The cursed creature cannot take 20. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Dust Digger	4.00	1200	Large	4	16, touch 9, flat-footed 16	42	5	1	4				10 ft., burrow 20 ft.	bite +5 (1d8+3 plus grab), 5 tentacles +3 (1d4+1 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	sinkhole, swallow whole (2d8+4 bludgeoning, AC 13, 4 hp)	Str 17, Dex 11, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 10	3	+7 (+11 grapple)	17 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Sinkhole (Ex) A dust digger can burrow into sand, loose soil, or dirt to lie in ambush just under the surface. When it feels (via tremorsense) prey walk into a square it threatens, it can deflate its body as an immediate action, causing the sand and other loose soil above to shift and slide. All creatures who were standing in the dust digger's reach must make a DC 15 Reflex save or become entangled as long as they remain in the dust digger's reach. All creatures who were standing at least partially in the dust digger's actual space must make a DC 15 Reflex save or become entangled and fall prone-if such a creature makes this save, it immediately moves to the closest adjacent unoccupied square. If this results in more than a 5-foot move, the creature moves that distance and then falls prone. The save DC is Strength-based.

Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or signs of its presence.  A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing dust digger flings the creature back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save.  Sinkhole (Ex) A buried dust digger can deflate its body as a free action, causing the sand above it to slide toward its maw. A creature standing on a space occupied by a buried dust digger when it deflates is immediately subjected to the dust digger's tentacle attacks.

Heat Aura (Ex) An emberleaf can suppress or restart its heat aura as a free action. If it uses its ring of fire ability, its heat aura automatically dissipates and it cannot restart it again for 1 hour.  Ring of Fire (Su) Once per day as a standard action, an emberleaf can create an immobile, blazing ring of fire in a 30-foot radius around its form. This fire is similar to a wall of fire spell. The ring of fire is 20 feet tall, and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it. Those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures passing through the ring take 3d6 points of fire damage. The ring deals this damage when it appears, and to all creatures in the area on the emberleaf's turn each round. The ring of fire lasts a number of rounds equal to the emberleaf's Hit Dice (6 rounds for a standard emberleaf). The emberleaf cannot use this ability to invoke its fire healing.

Any non-construct creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of a damaged emerald automaton takes 1d10 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 12 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Magic Dependent (Su) An emerald automaton is partially powered by magic. When deprived of magic, the automaton is affected as if it were exhausted. The automaton's magic can be cut off by antimagic, or suppressed by a dispel magic or mage's disjunction effect as if it were a magic item.  Proficient (Ex) An emerald automaton is proficient with all simple and martial weapons.																												
Eye Killer	4.00	1200	Medium	2	17, touch 12, flat-footed 15	45	7	7	2			sunlight vulnerability	30 ft.	tail slap +10 (1d8+4 plus grab)	eye ray +9 ranged touch (death gaze)	5 ft.	5 ft.	constrict (1d8+4)	Str 16, Dex 14, Con 14, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 12	6	+9 (+13 grapple)	21 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Death Gaze (Su) By using natural or magical light that illuminates it (meaning the eye killer must be within the radius covered by a natural or magical light source), an eye killer can amplify the light and refocus it in a line that functions as a death ray to a range of 50 feet. The eye killer must make a ranged touch attack against its target as a standard action. If successful, the creature struck must make succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or perish. Even if the save succeeds, the victim takes 3d6 points of damage. An eye killer can use this gaze once per day. The save DC is Constitution-based. Eye killers are immune to their own gaze attack and to the gaze attack of other eye killers. If the eye killer's gaze attack is reflected back upon it, it amplifies the intensity and projects it at a new target as an immediate action. The save DC to resist this gaze is increased by +2. Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex) If natural sunlight (including a daylight spell) is brought within 5 feet of an eye killer, it immediately releases a grappled foe and attempts to move as far away from the source of light as possible. On subsequent rounds, an eye killer is dazzled as long as it remains within 5 feet of the light source.																												
Faceless Stalker	4.00	1200	Medium	7	17, touch 13, flat-footed 14	42	5	4	6				30 ft.	mwk longsword +8 (1d8+4/19-20), slam +2 (1d6+2 plus grab)		5 ft.	10 ft.	blood drain (1 Constitution), sneak attack +2d6	Str 18, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 16	3	+7 (+11 grapple)	20	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Change Shape (Su) A faceless stalker can assume the form of a Medium humanoid at will but requires 10 uninterrupted minutes to alter its body. Performing this transformation is somewhat painful, but the faceless stalker can maintain its new form indefinitely once it has achieved  it. It can change back to its true form as a swift action and gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 round after it does so. Faceless stalkers retain their own innate abilities when they assume their new form and do not gain any of those belonging to the creature they mimic. A faceless stalker gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks when they are used in conjunction with this ability.  Faceless (Su) In its natural form, a faceless stalker has no discernible facial features. It gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist attacks or effects that target the senses. This includes gaze attacks, odor-based attacks, sonic attacks and similar attacks. This bonus does not apply to illusions.

Str 16, Dex 8, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 8	4	8	17 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Mucus (Ex) As a free action, a flail snail can excrete a trail of mucus that covers its space and lasts for 10 minutes. This mucus comes in two types: slimy and sticky. A character who attempts to move through an area covered in slippery mucus must make a DC 14 Reflex save each round or fall prone. Sticky mucus transforms squares into difficult terrain. Only one type of mucus can be in effect at a time in any one square. Flail snails can move through either type of slime with ease. A square of mucus exposed to a fire source dries and reverts to normal. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Retraction (Ex) A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts into its shell as a swift action, increasing its natural armor bonus by +6, but it cannot move or attack while retracted. It can return to normal as a free action.  Slime Rope (Ex) A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike strand up to 60 feet long, and can use this rope to hang itself and up to 1,000 extra pounds from the ceiling indefinitely, or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20 feet per round. It can climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round. Once the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes in 1d4 rounds. While the slime rope exists, other creatures can climb the rope with a DC 20 Climb check.  Suction (Ex) A flail snail's foot adheres to surfaces so well that its 10-foot climb speed applies even to perfectly sheer surfaces and ceilings, with no chance of the flail snail falling off unless it is actively pinned and peeled away as part of a grapple.  Warp Magic (Su) Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is an 80% chance that it produces a random effect instead of affecting the snail. Only spells that directly target the flail snail are warped; area effect spells are not affected. If a spell is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table.  1-3 Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the caster must make a DC 15 concentration check to successfully cast spells.  4-6 Spell misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is affected as if the spell had been cast on it instead.  7-9 Spell fails. Nothing happens.  10 Spell rebounds on caster (as spell turning).																												
Forest Drake	4.00	1200	Large	6	17, touch 11, flat-footed 15	42	6	6	4				30 ft., fly 60 ft.

This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 4d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 14 half) to all creatures within the resulting 10-foot-radius spread.  The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds once created, acting as a 10-foot-radius obscuring mist (it no longer causes damage), but a strong wind disperses it in a single round. Once a forest drake has used its acidic cloud breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.  Aquatic Adaptation (Ex) A forest drake can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon and other abilities while underwater. The acidic cloud created by that attack dissipates after 1 round if used underwater.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a forest drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.																												
Fossegrim	4.00	1200	Medium	7	18, touch 14, flat-footed 14	41	5	9	8				30 ft., swim 40 ft.	2 slams +8 (2d6)		5 ft.	5 ft.	drowning touch (DC 14), enchanting music (DC 19)	Str 10, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 21	4	4	17	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Drowning Touch (Su) A fossegrim can flood the lungs of a creature that is willing, is helpless, is affected by its enchanted music ability, touches it while it's in treasure form, or is touched by it (traditionally by kissing the creature on the lips). If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and immediately begins to drown slowly. On its turn, the target can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to cough up this water; if it fails, it falls unconscious at 0 hp. On the next round, a fallen target must attempt another DC 16 Fortitude save, dropping to -1 hit points and dying if it fails; on the next round it must attempt to save again or lose 1d6 hit points. On the first successful save, the water clears from the target's lungs and the target stabilizes. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Enchanting Music (Su) As a full-round action, a fossegrim can play a musical stringed instrument (usually a harp or violin) and target a single creature within 45 feet that can hear and see the fossegrim with an effect identical to the unnatural lustUM spell (CL 9th; Will DC 19). This action provokes an attack of opportunity. If the target touches or kisses the fossegrim, the fey can affect the target with its drowning touch ability. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Transparency (Su) When underwater, a fossegrim's body becomes transparent, effectively rendering it invisible. It can become visible or transparent at will as a free action.  Treasure Form (Su) As a standard action when completely underwater, a fossegrim can create an illusion causing it to resemble a Medium pile of gold and silver coins, glittering jewels, and valuable art objects. If a fossegrim speaks, moves, attacks, or uses any of its special abilities or spell-like abilities while in treasure form, the illusion dissipates. A successful DC 19 Will save is required to disbelieve this illusion. If a living creature within the fossegrim's melee reach touches or physically interacts with the illusion, the fossegrim reaches out to kiss or otherwise touch that creature, automatically affecting the creature with its drowning touch ability. The fossegrim can maintain this illusion indefinitely and can revert to its normal natural form as a free action. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect. The save DC to disbelieve is Charisma-based.

A successful DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a freezing flow in these environments. Any creature that fails to notice a freezing flow and walks into it automatically takes damage as if struck by the ooze's slam attack.  Jagged Slam (Ex) A freezing flow's slam attack is a slashing tendril of crystalline ice. It deals slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage and has a critical range of 19-20.  Numbing Touch (Ex) Each time a freezing flow deals cold damage with its slam attack or constrict ability, the target must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be staggered with numbing cold for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Create Spawn(Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by a wight becomes a wight itself in only 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical wights, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, as well as -2 hp per HD. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.  Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.																												
Fungus Man King	4.00	1200	Medium	1	16, touch 11, flat-footed 15	45	8	3	5			vulnerable to fire	20 ft.	slam +5 (1d4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	spore cloud	Str 10, Dex 13, Con 17, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 10	4	5	15	Tome of Horrors 4	Spore Cloud (Ex) Once per round as a standard action, a fungus man can release a cloud of noxious spores. All living creatures within 5 ft. must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is a poison effect, and once a creature successfully saves it is immune to the spore cloud of that particular fungus man for 24 hours.																												
Fungus Weird	4.00	1200	Large	7	16, touch 12, flat-footed 13	39	7	5	3				30 ft.	bite +7 (1d8+4 plus grab)		10 ft.	5 ft.	sleep spores	Str 17, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 13	4	+8 (+12 grapple) +4	21 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Camouflage (Ex) A fungus weird is effectively invisible in its pool until it attacks. It takes a successful DC 20 Spot check to notice a fungus weird in its pool before it attacks.  Fungus Pool A fungus weird's "pool" is not a pool at all, but an entanglement of leaves, branches, mosses, funguses, and plants. A typical pool covers a 20-foot radius, and a fungus weird (being bound to its pool) can never leave this area.  A creature that enters a fungus weird's pool (on its own or with the aid of the fungus weird) is automatically entangled (as the entangle spell) until it escapes. An entangled creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a full-round action to make a DC 15 Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus.  Sleep Spores (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a fungus weird can release a puff of greenish-yellow spores in a 10-foot cone. These spores induce sleep (as the sleep spell) if the opponent fails a DC 15 Will save. Unlike the sleep spell, there is no HD limit or maximum HD affected. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Reform (Ex) When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a fungus weird collapses back into its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any damage taken from fire-based spells and effects.

(perfect)	incorporeal touch +5 (1d6 plus possession)		5 ft.	5 ft.	possession	Str -, Dex 17, Con -, Int -, Wis 14, Cha 16	3	5	18	Tome of Horrors Complete	Aura of Despair (Su) A fye continually emanates an aura of despair in a 10-foot radius. Any creature within or entering this area must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability and skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for as long as they remain within the area. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the aura of despair of that fye for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. Possession (Su) Once per round by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a fye can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the possession by succeeding on a DC 15 Will save. If the save fails, the fye disappears and enters the target's body. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Gallows Tree Zombie	4.00	1200	Medium	6	17, touch 12, flat-footed 15	33	6	4	2				30 ft.	2 slams +8 (1d6+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	spore cloud	Str 19, Dex 15, Con 13, Int 4, Wis 10, Cha 1	4	8	20	Tome of Horrors Complete	Spore Cloud (Ex) As a free action, once every 1d4 rounds (but no more than three times per day), a gallows tree zombie can breathe a cloud of poisonous, greenish spores in a 5-foot cube directly in front of it. A creature caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be slowed (as the slow spell) for 6 rounds. One minute later, the creature must make another Fortitude save (same DC) or take 1d3 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Tether-Vine (Ex) A gallows tree zombie is connected to the gallows tree that created it by a long, sinewy vine. This vine can be lengthened to allow the zombie to move up to 100 feet away from the tree. The vine is AC 19 (touch 12) and has 10 hit points. Harming the vine deals no damage to the gallows tree zombie or the gallows tree, but if severed, does prevent the zombie from using its fast healing ability.  Tremorsense (Ex) Gallows tree zombies can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the same vegetation the zombie is touching.

Str 15, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 7	5	7	19	PFRPG Bestiary	Freeze (Ex) A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. A gargoyle that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.

Str 20, Dex 13, Con -, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 1	4	9	20	Inner Sea Bestiary	Adaptive Learning (Ex) A gearsman has a number of skill points equal to 4 + its Int modifier per Hit Die, and treats Craft and Profession as class skills beyond those possessed by all robots. In addition, a gearsman has a number of bonus skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice that can be reprogrammed to apply to any skill-these ranks cannot be split among multiple skills and must all apply to one skill. A gearsman may change what skill these bonus ranks apply to up to once per day by concentrating for 1 minute, during which time it can take no other actions. Rather than spend these bonus ranks on a skill, a gearsman can choose to devote them to weapon knowledge, gaining proficiency with a single weapon instead of bonus ranks in a skill. All gearsmen are automatically proficient with all simple weapons.  Charge Weapon (Ex) Any metal melee weapon wielded by a gearsman becomes charged with electricity and deals +1d6 points of electricity damage on a hit.  Self-Repair (Ex) A gearsman's nanites heal it of damage at the rate of a number of hit points per hour equal to its Hit Dice (4 hit points per hour for most gearsmen). Up to once per day, as a full-round action, it can heal any robot it touches of 4d6 points of damage-if a gearsman uses this ability on itself, it automatically heals the maximum amount: 24 points of damage.

As a result, a giant dragonfly gains Flyby Attack as a bonus feat. In addition, if a giant dragonfly charges while flying, it receives a +4 bonus on CMB checks made to grapple foes.

Implanting eggs in a host is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and the target must be helpless but alive. Once an egg is implanted, it exudes paralytic enzymes that not only keep the victim in a state of perpetual paralysis, but also keep it nourished and alive- and fully aware. This condition lasts until the egg hatches 1d6 days later, at which point the larvae consume most of the host, killing it. Any magical effect that removes paralysis or disease (such as remove paralysis, remove disease, or heal) destroys the eggs, but mere immunity to paralysis or disease does not offer protection.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

It gains Improved Critical (bite) as a bonus feat. The mandibles can sever body parts from opponents.  If a slicer beetle scores a natural 20 on its attack roll and confirms the critical hit, it severs one of the opponent's extremities (roll 1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left).

Str 22, Dex 15, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 7	3	10	22	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Diseased (Ex) Due to their filthy eating habits and constant exposure to decaying flesh, giant vultures are harbingers of disease-much more so than the standard vulture. Any creature bitten by a giant vulture has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, a victim can no longer be infected by this particular giant vulture, though attacks by different giant vultures are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses. While vultures aren't immune to all diseases, they do gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against such ailments.

All affected giant yellowjackets receive a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls for the remainder of the encounter and fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This is a mind-affecting effect- gloomwings and tenebrous worms are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Implant (Ex) A gloomwing can lay eggs inside a Small or larger helpless or dead creature as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A creature implanted with gloomwing eggs must make a DC 14 Fortitude save each morning to avoid suffering 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Within 24 hours of a creature's death from this damage, 1d4 young tenebrous worms (see page 259) emerge from the corpse, devouring it completely in the process. The eggs can be destroyed via any effect that cures disease, but the eggs themselves are not treated as a disease for purposes of what creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Pheromones (Su) After the first round of combat, a gloomwing can emit a strange, musky scent in a 30-foot radius as a free action. All creatures within this area (save for other gloomwings or tenebrous worms) must make a DC 14 Fortitude save each round to avoid becoming weakened by the pheromones. Once a creature fails a save against this effect, it takes a -4 penalty to its Strength score-this penalty lasts for as long as the battle continues and for 1 hour thereafter. Lesser restoration or any other effect capable of healing ability damage immediately removes this Strength penalty. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Gloomwing	4.00	1200	Large	3	19, touch 12, flat-footed 16	32	5	4	5				5 ft., fly 40 ft.

Any creature viewing the gloomwing from above must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be confused for 6 rounds.  The save DC is Constitution-based.  Implant Egg (Ex) As a standard action, a female gloomwing can lay eggs inside a slain creature of Small or larger size.  The young emerge about 2 weeks later as a tenebrous worms (see that entry), literally devouring the host from inside. While implanted, a body cannot be raised or resurrected except by the casting of a true resurrection, wish, or miracle, If remove disease or heal is cast on the body, the eggs are destroyed and the body can be raised normally.  Pheromone Call (Ex) Each round a gloomwing emits its weakness pheromone there is a 20% chance that 1d4 additional gloomwings arrive in the area and join the battle. This is not a summoning spell or spell-like ability; the gloomwings can detect the pheromone and are automatically drawn to it.  Weakness Pheromone (Ex) After the first round of combat, a gloomwing can emit a scent in a 30-foot radius as a free action that deals 1d2 points of Strength damage to any living, non-vermin creature (except gloomwings) in the area. An affected creature can make a successful DC 13 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area to negate the effects. On a successful save, that creature cannot be affected again by the same gloomwing's weakness pheromone for 24 hours. The pheromone ceases when the gloomwing dies. Strength damage dealt by a gloomwing's pheromone heals faster than normal (1 point per hour rather that 1 point per night of rest). The save DC is Constitution-based.

This deals 1 point of Constitution damage to the victim per minute until the victim dies or the blood poisoning is healed. A neutralize poison or remove disease spell rids the victim of blood poisoning, as does a DC 15 Heal check.  Multiple wounds to the same foe do not result in multiple instances of blood poisoning.

Each slam and constrict attack deals 1d6 additional acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a gray ooze takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes a gray ooze takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The ooze's touch deals 12 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. Transparent (Ex) Due to its lack of vivid coloration, a gray ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. A DC 15 Perception check is required to notice the gray ooze. Any creature that fails to notice a gray ooze and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the ooze's slam attack and is immediately subject to a grab attempt by the ooze.

If exposed to natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), they take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. Poison (Ex) The bite of a boneneedle secretes a thick, syrupy neurotoxin that destroys flesh and quickly breaks down bone. The chemical reaction causes the bones to weaken and become brittle. If the opponent fails his save against the poison's secondary effect, its bones weaken, and it takes an extra 2 points of damage from any crushing or bludgeoning attack until all Dexterity damage dealt by marrow poisoning is healed. Cumulative bites do not increase the amount of extra damage beyond 2 points An opponent reduced to Dexterity 0 dies as its bones become too brittle to support its weight thus causing its body to collapse in on itself. Creatures without bone structures, such as constructs (except those crafted from bone), oozes, and plants, are immune to the effects of marrow poisoning. Bone Needle Poison; Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; secondary effect: target takes an extra 2 points of damage from crushing or bludgeoning attacks until all Dex damage is healed; cure 1 save.

This cone deals 3d6 points of damage to living creatures (DC 15 Will save for half) or heals 3d6 points of damage on undead creatures in the area (no save). If a grimshrike takes levels in a class that provides the channel energy ability, its racial Hit Dice stack with the levels of that class for the purposes of determining the damage dealt or healed and the save DC. This ability counts as the channel energy class ability for any feat that requires it. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Gaze of Lost Souls (Su) Creatures meeting a grimshrike's gaze must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and be paralyzed 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Hala	4.00	1200	Medium	4	18, touch 14, flat-footed 14	37	6	8	8	vengeful wind	15	enemy of dragons and eagles	30 ft., fly 60 ft. (perfect)	2 claws +9 (1d4+3), bite +9 (1d6+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	hailstorm	Str 16, Dex 19, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 11, Cha 15	5	11	25 (29 vs. trip)	AP 49	Enemy of Dragons and Eagles (Ex) Halas are hated enemies of dragons and eagles. Those creatures gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against hala demons.  Hailstorm (Su) A hala can call down hailstones from surrounding clouds once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. These hailstones deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius that have no overhead cover. A DC 14 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. To use this ability, the hala must be outside and there must be clouds in the sky.  Stormwind Aura (Su) Halas surround themselves with a buffeting shroud of supernatural, windstorm-force winds. These winds shield a hala from any other wind effects and form a shell of breathable air around it, allowing the hala to breathe underwater. Ranged weapons and gases directed toward a hala are affected as the spell wind wall.  Vengeful Wind (Su) Anytime a hala takes damage from a critical hit, a powerful blast of wind explodes forth in the direction of the attacker. This blast takes the form of a 60-foot-long gale, treated as a gust of wind spell, directed from the hala toward the opponent that scored the critical hit against it (if that creature is more than 60 feet away, the wind is aimed in its direction but doesn't come close enough to affect it). This wind is also charged with electricity. Any creature in or that enters the area of effect must make a DC 14 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The call lasts as long as the hanu-naga performs its swaying dance. The naga may use the dance 3/day.  Control Simians (Su) The hanu-naga may command any simian within 60 ft. (no save).  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury or spit-contact; save DC 17 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spit (Ex) A hanu-naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this attack must make successful saves (see above) to avoid the effect.																												
Harpy	4.00	1200	Medium	2	16, touch 13, flat-footed 13	38	4	7	6				20 ft., fly 80 ft.

When a harpy sings, all creatures aside from other harpies within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same harpy's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the captivating song moves toward the harpy using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril.  Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Haunt	4.00	1200	Medium	6	15, touch 15, flat-footed 12	32	3	3	6	rejuvenation		vulnerability to dispel evil/good/law/chaos	20 ft., fly 30 ft. (perfect)	incorporeal touch +5 (1d4 cold plus 1d3 Dex)		5 ft.	5 ft.	Dexterity damage, malevolence (DC 14), strangle	Str -, Dex 15, Con -, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 14	3	3	18	Tome of Horrors Complete	Alternate Form (Su) A haunt's natural form is that of a translucent image appearing much as the person did in life.  As a standard action, it can alter its form so as to appear as a floating, luminescent ball of light (possibly being mistaken for a will-o'-wisp in this form). In this form, it cannot use its Dexterity damage attack or its malevolence attack. It retains its incorporeal form and can make an incorporeal touch attack that deals normal damage (but not Dex damage).  A haunt remains in one form or the other until it chooses to assume a new one (as a standard action). A change in form cannot be dispelled. A haunt cannot change forms while using its malevolence attack (that is, while possessing a host).  Malevolence (Su) Once per round, a haunt can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane whose Dexterity has been reduced to 0 (either through the haunt's touch or by some other means). This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the haunt's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the haunt must be adjacent to the target.  The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 14 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same haunt's malevolence for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the haunt vanishes into the target's body (whose Dexterity temporarily returns to normal) and attempts to complete its unfinished task.  If the haunt completes its task, it leaves the host and fades away forever. When the haunt leaves the host, the host's Dexterity drops back to 0. If the host body is slain while the haunt is in possession of it, the creature becomes tied to that area and can never leave. Its unfinished task remains the same.  Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a haunt through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 1d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a haunt is to use dispel evil/good/law/chaos (depending on the haunt's alignment) or determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.  Strangle (Su) If a creature possessed by a haunt has an alignment opposite to that of the haunt on either the law/ chaos or good/evil axis, it attempts to strangle the host using its own hands (i.e., the hands of the host body).  Unless precautions are taken to restrain the possessed victim's hands, they immediately reach for the throat and begin strangling the haunt-possessed body. An opponent takes 1d4 points of damage each round until its hands are forcibly restrained with a successful CMB check, the haunt is ejected from the body, or the victim dies.  Vulnerability (Ex) A haunt can be forcibly ejected from a host if hold person is cast on the victim and the haunt fails its Will save. A dispel evil/good/law/chaos spell (depending on the haunt's alignment) instantly ejects the creature from the host and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the haunt. A haunt slain in such a manner cannot rejuvenate and is permanently destroyed.																												
Hippopotamus	4.00	1200	Large	4	14, touch 9, flat-footed 14	51	8	5	3				30 ft., swim 30 ft.	bite +7 (2d8+6)		10 ft.	5 ft.	capsize, trample (1d6+6, DC 17)	Str 19, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 4	4	10	20 (24 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Capsize (Ex) A submerged hippo that surfaces under a boat less than its space can capsize it by making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 10, or the result of the boat pilot's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the boat is larger than the hippo's size, the hippo takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.  Hold Breath (Ex) A hippo can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

Str 15, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 12	6	8	18	PFRPG Bestiary	Change Shape (Su) A hound archon can assume any canine form of Small to Large size, as if using beast shape II. While in canine form, the hound archon loses its bite, slam, and greatsword attacks, but gains the bite attack of the form it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines include any dog-like or wolf-like creature of the animal type.																												
Huldra	4.00	1200	Medium	3	17, touch 14, flat-footed 13	38	4	8	7				30 ft.	slam +7 (1d6+4), tail slap +7 (1d6+4 plus 1d4 Cha damage)		5 ft.	5 ft.	lashing tail, manipulate luck	Str 19, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 19	3	7	21	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Lashing Tail (Su) A huldra's tail slap is a primary attack. In addition, each time a huldra damages a creature with her tail slap, she deals 1d4 points of Charisma damage, causing her target to grow progressively more deformed and ugly with each strike. A successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates the Charisma damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Manipulate Luck (Su) Once per day, a huldra can manipulate another creature's luck by spending a full-round action, during which the huldra must remain in physical contact with the target creature. When the huldra uses this ability, she must choose whether she is imparting good luck or bad luck. A creature granted good luck gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks, while a creature afflicted with bad luck takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks. A successful DC 17 Will save negates the effect. Huldras cannot be the target of this ability. This effect lasts for 24 hours and is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This fast healing applies only to damage inflicted on the hydra's body. Hydra Traits (Ex) A hydra can be killed by severing all of its heads or slaying its body. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra's HD. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra's body equal to the hydra's current HD. A hydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties. Regenerate Head (Ex) When a hydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A hydra cannot have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A hydra doesn't die from losing its heads until all are cut off and the stumps seared by acid or fire.

In battle, its glow increases, filling the area within 5 feet.  An iophanite can suppress or resume this glow as a free action. Additionally, as a standard action at will an iophanite can intensify its glow to reproduce the effects of the spell flare.  A creature can resist this effect with a DC 14 Fortitude save, though evil creatures take a -4 penalty on their saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shield Form (Su) Once per day, an iophanite can transform into a +1 spiked light steel shield sized for a Small or Medium creature. An iophanite cannot communicate or use any of its other abilities while in this form. Once it transforms, it cannot change back for 24 hours, though the spell break enchantment can end the transformation early. An iophanite regains its full hit points when it shifts back into its normal form. If the shield is destroyed, the iophanite is killed.																												
Jade Idol	4.00	1200	Diminutive	7	20, touch 17, flat-footed 16	22	1	6	2				10 ft.	2 slams +5 (1d2-3)	sliver +10 (1d2-3)	1 ft.	0 ft.	jade breath, venom affinity	Str 4, Dex 17, Con -, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 14	4	3	10	AP 27	Jade Breath (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a jade idol can exhale a breath of gas that unerringly snakes its way through the air to envelop a single target within 50 feet. If the target is reduced to 0 Dexterity, it is instantly turned to jade-colored stone. Inanimate corpses targeted by this attack are instantly turned to stone, but benefit from the perpetual effects of gentle repose while petrified. The spell stone to flesh reverses this effect.  Poison-inhaled; save DC 14; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dexterity damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Inanimate (Ex) An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise. Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.  Share Abilities (Su) An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).  Skills In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.  Tainted Air (Su) All creatures within 30 feet of a jade idol take a -2 penalty on saving throws against poison. The effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the jade idol's aura.  Venom Affinity (Su) Any poisonous animal or vermin that comes within 10 feet of a jade idol or a creature bearing the idol must make a DC 14 Will save or be charmed as per the spell charm animal. Beasts affected by this effect remain charmed for 10 minutes, obeying either the idol's will or its bearer's. Any creature that makes its save cannot be affected by the same jade idol's venom affinity for the next 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Elemental Endurance (Ex) Jann can remain on the Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours at a time. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.

It gains the swarm subtype, its space changes to 10 feet, and its reach changes to 0. In this form, it gains a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage and inflicts disease, but loses its slam attacks. It can revert back to its normal form as a full-round action.  Disease (Ex) Tetanus: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 1d6 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d4 Dex damage. Each time someone takes Dexterity damage from tetanus, there's a 50% chance his jaw muscles stiffen, preventing speech and the use of spells with verbal components for 24 hours; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.   Immunity to Magic (Ex) A junk golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a junk golem, as noted below. • A shatter spell causes a junk golem to discorporate and dazes it for 1 round. • A grease spell affects the junk golem as if it were haste for 1d6 rounds and ends any slow effect on it. • An arcane lock or hold portal spell affects the junk golem as if it were a slow spell for 1d6 rounds and breaks any haste effect on it. • A wood shape or rusting grasp spell deals 2d6 points of damage to a junk golem.  Junk Repair (Su) A junk golem has fast healing 2 when in an area with a high concentration of debris, such as a refuse heap or the area created by another junk golem's discorporate ability.

Slapping or wounding awakens a creature put to sleep by this attack, but normal noise does not. This is a sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Snakes (Ex) A kamadan's snakes attack simultaneously; this is always a secondary attack.  Kamadans are wicked hunters that enjoy stalking and toying with prey, especially when their quarry is relatively intelligent. When a kamadan attacks, it first uses its soporific breath, then pounces on any targets that remain awake. Kamadans stand about 3 feet at the shoulder, about 9 feet long and weighing up to 500 pounds.

When the karkinoi brood swarm ends its turn in the space of a Medium or smaller creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or become entangled. This effect lasts for 1 round or until the creature leaves the karkinoi brood swarm's space, whichever comes first.  The save DC is normally Strength-based, but because the karkinoi brood swarm has the Agile Maneuvers feat, the DC is instead Dexterity-based.  Consume (Ex) A karkinoi brood swarm can rapidly consume any creature it swarms over. Against helpless or nauseated targets, a karkinoi brood swarm's attack deals 4d6 points of damage.  Scuttling Swarm (Ex) A karkinoi brood swarm can use its Step Up feat to move and reshape itself when a creature takes a 5-foot step while within the swarm's area.

Water Dependency (Ex) A karkinoi brood swarm can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this limit, it runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were drowning.

The target must make a DC 16 Will saving throw or become captivated by the kelpie, thinking it is a desirable woman in mortal danger or (if in hippocampus or horse form) a valuable steed. A victim under the effects of the captivating lure moves toward the kelpie using the most direct means available. If the path leads it into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril; the victim does not consider water a dangerous area, and will enter the water even if it cannot swim or breathe. A captivated creature can take no actions other than to move toward the kelpie and defend itself, even if it is drowning. A victim within 5 feet of the kelpie simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues as long as the kelpie is alive and the victim is within 1 mile of the kelpie. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Kelpie	4.00	1200	Medium	6	17, touch 12, flat-footed 15	28	5	3	4	reshape form			20 ft., swim 30 ft.	slam +5 (1d4+2 plus grab plus charm touch)		5 ft.	5 ft.	charm (DC 17)	Str 15, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 8, Wis 13, Cha 17	3	+5 (+9 to grapple)	17	Tome of Horrors Complete	Charm (Su) Once per day, a kelpie can produce an effect identical to the charm monster spell (caster level 9th). The target can make a DC 17 Will save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the victim believes the kelpie to be a very beautiful and attractive creature, and attempts to move as quickly as possible toward the kelpie.  The kelpie can automatically grapple a charmed foe and attempts to drown the victim. A charmed foe does not resist the kelpie's embrace, and the drowning attempt does not allow an additional save. Female creatures are immune to the kelpie's charm ability; only males can be affected.  The charm is negated if the victim dies, the kelpie dies, or dispel magic, greater dispelling, miracle, or wish is cast on the victim. If the save is successful, the target cannot be affected by that kelpie's charm or charm touch for 24 hours.  The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Charm Touch (Su) On a successful slam attack, a kelpie's target must make a DC 17 or be charmed as described under the charm ability above. This effect does not stack with that ability.  Reshape Form (Su) A kelpie's natural form is that of a mass of dark green seaweed. It can assume three other forms.  The first is a Small or Medium female humanoid. The second form is a hippocampus (see that entry). The third form is a Large green horse. In each form, the kelpie retains all of her special abilities. She does not truly alter her form (such as shapechangers do), she simply reshapes her body. In all of her forms, the kelpie's skin/fur has a greenish cast, and her features are slightly distorted. The kelpie's ruse can be detected if an opponent who is not charmed succeeds on a DC 10 Perception check.  Telepathy (Su) A kelpie can communicate telepathically to a range of 1 mile with any creature she has touched.																												
Khargra	4.00	1200	Small	6	23, touch 13, flat-footed 21	42	6	6	1			vulnerabilities (see below)	10 ft., burrow 30 ft.	3 claws +8 (1d3+2 plus grab) and bite +8 (2d8+2)		5 ft.	5 ft.	rend armor, sundering bite	Str 15, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 5, Wis 11, Cha 10	5	+6 (+10 to grapple)	18	Tome of Horrors Complete	Earth Glide (Ex) A khargra can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth, including metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing khargra flings the khargra back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.  Rend Armor (Ex) If a khargra hits with a bite attack, it deals normal bite damage and pulls apart any metal armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures wearing no armor or non-metal armor are unaffected by this special attack (though they still take normal bite damage). Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed and devoured by the khargra.  Damaged armor gains the broken condition.  Sundering Bite (Ex) A khargra can making a sunder attempt with its bite attack against an opponent's weapon or shield without provoking attacks of opportunity. Resolve this using the normal rules for a sunder attempt. If the khargra succeeds on its CMB roll, it deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the weapon or shield. Note, against a khargra, a weapon or shield's hardness is only one-half as effective as normal. This means that a light steel shield, for example, is considered to have a hardness of 5 rather than 10 against a khargra's sunder attack. A weapon or shield reduced to 0 or less hit points is destroyed and half of it is swallowed by the khargra.  It only uses this special attack against metal weapons and shields. Damaged armor and weapons gain the broken condition.  Vulnerabilities (Ex) A khargra takes maximum damage from a heat metal spell (no save). A transmute metal to wood deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to a khargra. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 17 + caster's ability modifier) to reduce the damage by half.

Str 19, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 13	3	6	20	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Animated Hair (Su) A korred's hair is constantly writhing and twitching. As a free action, a korred can cause its long hair to reach out and interfere with adjacent creatures- tugging at clothes and weapons, tangling feet and arms, tickling, and generally making a nuisance of itself. The korred can select which adjacent targets are affected by its animated hair.  These targets must make a successful DC 16 Reflex save each round to avoid becoming entangled for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Stone Stride (Su) This ability works like tree stride, except it requires loose boulders at least as large as the korred, and only has a range of 30 feet. The korred can use this ability once per round as a standard action.  Stunning Laugh (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a korred can unleash a strange laugh that stuns all creatures within a 30-foot burst for 1d2 rounds (Fortitude DC 14 negates). This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Fey are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Str 19, Dex 15, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 13	3	6	19	Tome of Horrors Complete	Animate Hair (Su) A korred can weave its hair (contained in its pouch) into animated ropes that can entangle foes. The time it takes to weave enough hair to entangle one foe is dependent on the size of the creature as follows: Size Time Up to Tiny 1 round Small or Medium 2 rounds Large 3 rounds A korred cannot entangle an opponent of greater than Large size. This ability otherwise is similar to the animate rope spell (caster level 15th) Laugh (Su) Three times per day, a korred can unleash a laugh that stuns all creatures that hear it within 60 feet for 1d2 rounds. A DC 14 Will save negates the effects. A bard's countersong ability allows a stunned creature a new Will save to break free. Whether the save is successful or not, a creature is immune to the laugh of the same korred for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.

As a result, it has a 25% chance of taking no damage from any nonmagical attack. It takes only 75% of the damage from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. However, it takes full damage from incorporeal creatures and effects, force effects, and ghost touch weapons. Strength Damage (Su) A lampadarius's touch deals 1d6 points of Strength damage to a living creature. This is a negative energy effect. If the kyton deals Strength damage that equals or exceeds the target's Strength score, the kyton gains the benefits of death knell for 1 hour. Unnerving Gaze (Su) Shaken, range 30 ft., Will DC 13 negates. A lampadarius can make an opponent feel like its own shadow is attempting to claw its face. Those who fail their saves are shaken for 1d3 rounds. This ability has no effect if there is no light present to create shadows. In dim illumination, the DC increases by 2. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Large Salt Elemental	4.00	1200	Large	0	17, touch 9, flat-footed 17	45	7	2	5			vulnerability to water	20 ft.	2 claws +9 (1d8+4 slashing plus salt poisoning)		10 ft.	10 ft.	salt poisoning (9 rounds, DC 15)	Str 18, Dex 10, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	6	11	21	Tome of Horrors 4	Dehydration Aura (Su) A salt elemental's aura draws moisture from an area centered on itself. Living creatures within range take damage (damage is detailed with each elemental) each round they remain in the area. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. This effect is especially devastating to plants, animals, and aquatic creatures, which take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Earth Mastery (Ex) A salt elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)  Salt Poisoning (Ex) Anyone hit by a salt elemental's claw attack is sickened for 3 rounds + 1 round per Hit Dice of the salt elemental. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A salt elemental submerged in water that covers at least half its body takes 1d6 points of damage each round until it escapes. Damage from water-based attacks (such as the slam attack of a water elemental) deal +50% damage to a salt elemental.

The leechroot gains fast healing equal to the number of creatures with the bleed condition it is grappling (if any).  Bloody Sap (Su) The viscous resin that exudes from a leechroot's tentacles is infused with negative energy, preventing both natural and magical healing. The DC of any Heal check to stop the bleeding caused by a leechroot's attacks is increased by 2. Casting a cure spell on a creature bleeding because of a leechroot's attacks requires a successful caster level check (DC 15 + the spell's level) or the spell has no effect on the bleeding creature.  Drag Under (Ex) As part of an action to maintain a grapple, a leechroot can move the grappled creature up to 5 feet (within the leechroot's reach) and bury it partway into the ground. The buried creature is pinned and can't receive help to break free from the grapple. A buried opponent that escapes the grapple remains pinned unless it spends a move action to dig itself free and it succeeds at a DC 10 Strength check.  Earth Barrier (Ex) A leechroot burrowing 5 feet below the surface is partially visible, can make attacks using its normal reach, and gains concealment and partial cover. It can be uprooted with a successful drag maneuver. It can burrow back under the earth as a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Lightning Bladder	4.00	1200	Medium	-5	5, touch 5, flat-footed 5	50	9	-4	-4	ooze traits			10 ft., swim 30 ft.	slam +6 (1d6+4 plus 1d6 acid)		5 ft.	5 ft.	acid, electrical discharge	Str 16, Dex 1, Con 26, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	3	6	11 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Acid (Ex) The corrosive acid that covers a lightning bladder dissolves metals and organic material, but not stone. Each slam attack deals 1d6 additional acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature touched by a lightning bladder takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes the creature takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The bladder's touch deals 12 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the bladder must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Electrical Discharge (Ex) Any hit scored against a lightning bladder with a piercing or slashing weapon opens a hole in the creature's acidic membrane, through which lightning-like charges of electricity will blast out each subsequent combat round. These bolts of lightning inflict 2d6 points of damage against a randomly determined opponent (DC 15 Reflex save for half damage). The bladder can have any number of such openings before it is eventually killed from the damage.																												
Living Cave Painting	4.00	1200	Medium	9	18, touch 18, flat-footed 12	39	4	7	6	amorphous		vulnerable to erase	30 ft., climb 30 ft.	ocherous touch +9 touch (1d6 plus 2d6 bleed)		5 ft.	0 ft.	manifestation, ocherous touch	Str -, Dex 21, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 15	4	4	22 (can't be tripped)	AP 93	Captivating Artistry (Su) Any creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 that begins its turn within 30 feet of a living cave painting must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or be fascinated for 1 round. Hostile actions by the living cave painting that don't target or affect the fascinated creature do not end the fascinated effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the target is immune to the same living cave painting's captivating artistry aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Manifestation (Sp) A living cave painting manifests itself in the three-dimensional world by shaping quasi-real illusions. Three times per day, a living cave painting can use shadow conjuration as a spell-like ability, but the shadow conjuration can mimic only summon nature's ally III spells. Additionally, whenever a conjured creature takes enough damage to destroy it, the living cave painting can instead, as a free action, sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of  damage done to the shadow conjuration. The caster level for this effect is 7th. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Ocherous Touch (Ex) A living cave painting's touch causes vicious wounds to appear on the victim's body, dealing 1d6 points of damage and 2d6 points of bleed damage. The living cave painting uses its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier to resolve all touch attacks.  Two-Dimensional (Ex) A living cave painting exists in only two dimensions, and has some qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A living cave painting has no Strength score. Additionally, it gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as jumping or flying), and can navigate only along solid surfaces such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can attack creatures only by entering their squares and touching them directly. A living cave painting can crawl onto solid objects that can then themselves be moved through other means. It cannot fall or take falling damage, and it cannot use or be affected by combat maneuvers such as bull rush, grapple, or trip. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the opponent's equipment. It has no weight, and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight. A living cave painting takes no damage from nonmagical attacks and takes only half the normal amount of damage from magical weapons.  Vulnerable to Erase (Ex) A living cave painting can be targeted by an erase spell, which deals 3d6 points of damage to the creature.																												
Living Topiary	4.00	1200	Medium	6	16, touch 12, flat-footed 14	42	10	3	1			vulnerable to fire	30 ft.	2 slams +6 (1d6+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 17, Dex 14, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 9	3	6	18 (22 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Assimilate (Ex) As a full-round action, a living topiary can consume undergrowth or bushy plant matter it's currently touching and incorporate that material into its form. It can do this at a rate of 5 cubic feet per round, healing 1d8 points of damage each time. If the topiary is at maximum hit points, this ability has no effect.  Hedge Stride (Sp) This ability functions as tree stride, but rather than allowing for teleportation from tree to tree, it permits the living topiary to teleport from one area of brush or hedges to another area of similar vegetation within 1,500 feet.  Move through Hedges (Ex) A living topiary may move through any mass of brambles or other dense plant growth without penalty. It must begin and end its turn outside of the mass.  Sculpt Shape (Ex) As a standard action, a living topiary can alter itself to take on the basic form of any creature. The change is purely cosmetic, and does not change its size, grant it any special powers, or alter its abilities.																												
Living Wall	4.00	1200	Large	-4	12, touch 5, flat-footed 12	46	1	-3	1				10 ft.	2 slams +6 (1d8+4 plus grab)		10 ft.	5 ft.	crushing push, push (slam, 5 ft.)	Str 18, Dex 3, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	3	+8 (+10 bull rush, +12 grapple)	14 (16 vs. bull rush)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Crushing Push (Ex) A living wall adjacent to a creature that is also adjacent to a barrier (such as a dungeon wall, gate, or another living wall) can spend a standard action to crush that creature against the barrier, dealing 1d8+6 points of damage. If the living wall is grappling the target, as part of this attack it can attempt a free combat maneuver check to pin the target.  Fleshy Link (Ex) A living wall that is adjacent to another living wall automatically links with it, forming an impassible solid barrier. Linked living walls coordinate their attacks and move as one creature. Any linked wall can unlink itself as a free action. Any damage to one linked living wall is divided evenly among all linked living walls (for example, if three walls are linked and one takes 15 points of damage, each wall instead takes 5 points of damage). Two or three linked living walls count as a Huge creature for the purpose of effects affected or limited by size (such as bull rush), four or five count as Gargantuan, and six or more count as Colossal. A living wall is a construct built out of the bodies of many creatures and mortared together with liquefied f lesh.

As long as it's within 10 feet of some sort of stone, a lythic can hide itself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind.  Earth Glide (Su) A lythic can glide through stone, dirt or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing lythic flings the lythic back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.  Fury of the Earth (Su) Anytime a lythic suffers more than 50% of its normal hit points in damage in a single encounter, it flies into a berserker-like rage. This grants the lythic a bonus to its damage rolls equal to one-half its Hit Dice for the remainder of the encounter. It cannot end this fury voluntarily but continues until all opponents are defeated or have fled.

Shriek (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a mandragora can give voice to an unsettling shriek. All creatures within a 30-foot spread of a shrieking mandragora must make a DC 15 Will save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerable to Supernatural Darkness (Ex) In areas of supernatural darkness (such as those created by deeper darkness, but not by darkness), a mandragora is slowed, as the slow spell.																												
Marble Sentinel	4.00	1200	Small	7	20, touch 14, flat-footed 17	43	2	5	2				40 ft., climb 20 ft.	2 claws +12 (1d4+5)	paralyzing bolt +10 (paralysis)	5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 20, Dex 16, Con -, Int 1, Wis 11, Cha 5	6	10	23 (31 vs. trip)	AP 62	Alert (Su) A marble sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and it possesses the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which it's keyed. When a marble sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a marble sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal concentration. A marble sentinel's creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.   Immunity to Magic (Ex) A marble sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the force descriptor.  Paralyzing Bolt (Su) As a standard action, a marble sentinel can fire a green-hued bolt of energy as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. A creature struck by this ray must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Mask Golem	4.00	1200	Medium	7	17, touch 13, flat-footed 14	42	1	6	2			vulnerability to sonic	40 ft.	2 slams +8 (1d8+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	masks of control, swarm form	Str 18, Dex 17, Con -, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 13	4	8	21	Masks Of The Living God	Immunity to Magic (Ex) A mask golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A shatter spell deals 4d6 points of damage (no save).  • A grease spell prevents the mask golem from using its masks of control ability for the duration of the spell (no save). Masks that are already in place are unaffected.  • A make whole spell heals the golem as normal and automatically restores one of its masks of control if any have been destroyed.  • Any magical attack against a mask golem that deals sonic damage affects the mask golem normally.  Masks of Control (Su): As a standard action, a mask golem can force one of its masks onto a humanoid opponent's face. This ability has a range of 30 feet. Attaching a mask in this way requires a successful combat maneuver check and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once in place, the mask has one of two effects.  Obedience: The target must make a DC 13 Will save each round or fall under the mask golem's control for 1 round. This functions as dominate person. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Solitude: The target cannot speak, breathe, or hear while the mask is in place.  The mask can be removed with a successful combat maneuver check against the mask golem's CMD. The mask can also be destroyed, but half of any damage dealt is made to the target instead of the mask. The mask has Hardness 5 and 5 hit points. A mask golem has a number of masks equal to its Hit Dice (usually 4). If removed from a victim, the mask returns to the golem immediately and can be used again.  Destroyed masks are replenished at the rate of 1 per day.  Swarm Form (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a mask golem can assume the form of a swarm of masks. While in this form, it gains the swarm subtype, a fly speed of 60 feet (average), a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, and the distraction quality (DC 12). Anyone whotakes damage from the swarm attack can also be attacked with one of the golem's masks of control as a free action (assuming the golem has enough masks available). The swarm is made up of Tiny creatures, but does not gain any additional damage reduction. A mask golem can maintain this form for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Any damage dealt to the swarm is subtracted from the golem's hit points, as normal.

Mawler	4.00	1200	Tiny	3	19, touch 15, flat-footed 16	39	4	5	7				20 ft.	bite +9 (1d4+1 plus grab)		2-1/2 ft.	0 ft.	constrict (1d4+1), vorpal bite	Str 13, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 11, Cha 11	4	+3 (+7 grapple)	16 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Magic Aura (Su) A mawler continuously emits a moderate aura of transmutation magic. This ability can be negated or dispelled (versus caster level 6), but the mawler can activate it as a free action on its next turn.  Mimic Shape (Ex) A mawler can assume the general shape of any object that is roughly Tiny sized. A mawler's body is fleshy and pliable, but it can alter the rigidity of its body to resemble metal, wood, and even stone. Most mawlers have found that taking on the shape of articles of clothing provides the most ready meals. The ruse can be detected by a Perception check opposed by the mawler's Disguise skill.  Vorpal Bite (Ex) A mawler that scores a critical hit with its bite attack while being worn severs the extremity that was inside it at the time. For example, a mawler being worn as a boot that scores a critical hit, severs the victim's leg. A mawler can only use its vorpal bite while being worn.  A creature that loses a limb suffers a -4 penalty to skill checks that require the use of two limbs. For example, a victim that loses a hand or arm suffers a -4 penalty to Climb checks, Disable Device checks, and so forth. Additionally, a creature that loses its primary weapon-wielding arm or hand suffers a -6 penalty when wielding a weapon in its offhand. A creature with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat that loses its primary arm or hand ignores the penalty for wielding a weapon in its offhand.  If the victim loses a foot or leg, the penalty applies to Acrobatics checks and the like. Additionally, the creature's speed is reduced to one-quarter. If the severed extremity happens to be the head, the victim dies immediately (unless it can live without its head).																												
Medium Positive Energy Elemental	4.00	1200	Medium	9	19, touch 16, flat-footed 13	30	3	9	4				fly 60 ft. (good)	slam +9 (1d6+1 plus 1d6 positive energy)		5 ft.	5 ft.	blinding flash (DC 14), death throes (20 ft. radius, DC 14, 2d8 positive energy damage), positive energy	Str 12, Dex 21, Con 14, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	4	5	21	Tome of Horrors Complete	Blinding Flash (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a positive energy elemental of at least Medium size can release a burst of pure energy in a 10-foot radius. Creatures viewing this burst must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. See the table below for the save DC for each positive energy elemental's blinding flash. The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Throes (Su) A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura). Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's positive energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's positive energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. All creatures in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC as the elemental's positive energy save DC) or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Positive Energy (Ex) A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with positive energy. This deals extra damage to an undead or negative energy based target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) by the same amount. Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of positive energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each positive energy elemental's save DC. Positive energy (such as a cure spell or positive energy channeling) can heal positive energy elementals. Positive Energy Aura (Su) A positive energy elemental radiates an aura of pure positive energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the positive energy channeling ability of the positive energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other positive energy elementals. Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy, including inflict spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Positive Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger positive energy elemental can channel positive energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  If an opponent failed a save against the poison, one week after suffering the effects of the mercury poisoning, if the target has not received the benefits of a neutralize poison during that time span, then he must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 10th). The effects can be removed by the successful casting of a greater restoration, heal, miracle, or wish spell.

An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adhesivecoated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic can still grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is Strength-based. Mimic Object (Ex) A mimic can assume the general shape of any Medium object, such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic's body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. A mimic gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks when imitating an object in this manner. Disguise is always a class skill for a mimic.

Curse of the Deep (Su) On a successful grapple check against a creature up to its size, a mummy of the deep presses its lips against an opponent's and regurgitates sea water into the opponent's lungs. Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the character has coughed up enough water to shake the effects of this attack and takes no further damage. An affected creature can take no actions other than to defend itself in any round it takes damage from this ability. At 0 or less hit points, the victim falls unconscious. In the next round, he drowns. The save DC is Charisma-based. Holding one's breath does not prevent drowning (water is already in the lungs). A remove curse, heal spell, or successful DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the creature reaches 0 or less hit points. Despair (Su) At the mere sight of a mummy of the deep, the viewer must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that mummy of the deep's despair ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Myceloid	4.00	1200	Medium	4	16, touch 10, flat-footed 16	37	7	1	4			vulnerable to electricity	20 ft.	2 claws +6 (1d6+3 plus disease)		5 ft.	5 ft.	spore cloud	Str 17, Dex 11, Con 16, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 10	3	6	16	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Disease (Su) Purple Pox: inhaled or injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Wis and 1d2 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. A creature that dies of the purple pox becomes bloated over the course of 24 hours, after which its body bursts open, releasing a fully grown myceloid. Additionally, as long as a creature takes at least 7 points of Wisdom damage from the purple pox, it must make a DC 15 Will save each day to avoid becoming affected by a lesser geas (no HD limit) that compels the sickly character to seek out the nearest myceloid colony in order to offer itself up for spore domination. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Spore Cloud (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a myceloid can expel a 10-foot-radius burst of spores centered on itself. This cloud persists for 1d3 rounds. Any creature caught in this cloud or that moves through it is exposed to the myceloid's purple pox disease-a creature need save only once against any one spore cloud, however, before becoming permanently immune to that particular spore cloud's effects. The spore cloud does not hamper vision.  Spore Domination (Sp) This spell-like ability functions as charm monster, but functions only against creatures currently infected with purple pox.																												
Mythic Cockatrice	4.00	1200	Small	3	17, touch 16, flat-footed 12	43	5	8	3	stone plumage			20 ft., fly 60 ft.

Each time a creature is damaged by a mythic cockatrice's bite attack, it must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity damage as its flesh and bones stiffen and harden. If a creature's Dexterity score is reduced to 0 by a cockatrice's bite, that creature immediately turns completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day, a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save; if it succeeds, the victim recovers from the petrification with a Dexterity score of 1 (and thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal). If a petrified creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has any Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources. A cockatrice is immune to the petrification ability of itself and of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Petrification Aura (Su) A creature within 30 feet of a mythic cockatrice on its turn must successfully save or be subjected by petrification as if it had been bitten.  Stone Plumage (Su) Any weapon that strikes a mythic cockatrice takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses the weapon's hardness. Any creature attacking the cockatrice with natural weapons or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 points of damage.

The ogre takes no damage from the attack. As an immediate action, a mythic ogre can expend one use of mythic power to use this ability to ignore all attacks from one creature for 1 round.  Rising Fury (Ex) Each time a mythic ogre takes damage, it gains a +2 morale bonus on damage rolls until the end of its next turn. This bonus increases by +2 each time the ogre takes damage, up to a maximum of +10. At the end of the ogre's turn, this damage bonus resets to +0.

If a nightgaunt uses its fly speed to move itself and a grappled target, it can fly at full speed.  Faceless (Ex) A nightgaunt has no face, but can still see in all directions as if its entire body were an eye. It is immune to gaze attacks, but not to illusions that rely upon vision to function. It has no need to breathe, and is immune to all inhaled and scent-based effects.  Tickle (Ex) As a swift action, a nightgaunt can use its tail to tickle a grappled or helpless foe with horrible efficiency. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spider Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, except that an ettercap can only use this ability on spiders. An ettercap gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Spiders are mindless, but this empathic communication imparts to them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing ettercaps to train giant spiders and use them as guardians.  Traps (Ex) An ettercap is particularly skilled at crafting cunning traps with its webs. Deadfalls, nooses, and spear traps are the most common traps ettercaps build with their webs.  An ettercap doesn't require gold to build its traps, merely time. Rules for crafting traps can be found in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Ettercap traps can be found on page 129 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.

Any creatures other than nirentos in the area must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become entranced by the nirento's graceful movements, thereafter believing the nirento to be a perfectly normal tree. Affected creatures become passive for 1d6 minutes and refuse to attack the nirento during this time. Affected creatures can attempt a new Will save each round that the nirento attacks an ally-if a hypnotized creature is attacked by the nirento, it gains a +4 bonus on its Will save to see through the hypnotic display. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The noble steed loses the ability to fly for as long as the antimagic effect persists or for as long as it remains in the area.

In battle, its glow increases, filling the area within 5 feet of it with shining motes. These motes cling to all creatures in the affected area, outlining them as glitterdust for 6 rounds. Opponents in the area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be blinded; a blinded creature may attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end the blindness. The motes persist for 1 round after the orsheval moves from a square, leaving a trailing cloud that can affect creatures that move into the affected area. The orsheval can suppress or reactivate the glow or motes as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Once per round as a free action, an ourdivar can change the damage type of its natural weapons to bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing, thereby allowing it to overcome damage reduction of those types as well.  Warpwave Exit (Su) An ourdivar that is killed or that lives out the length of its summoned time on the Material Plane erupts in a wave of chaotic energy. Upon the death of an ourdivar or when any spell or effect summoning or calling an ourdivar ends, 1d4+1 corporeal creatures within 15 feet of the ourdivar are affected by a minor warpwave (see the sidebar on page 87). Targets can resist the warpwave's effects with a successful DC 15 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The pachycephalosaurus cannot move with the target of the bull rush. If a pachycephalosaurus scores a critical hit against a creature with its slam attack at the end of a charge, it also staggers the target for 1 round. If the victim succeeds at a DC 18 Fortitude save, the stagger effect is negated, but the victim still suffers the effects of the dinosaur's bull rush attempt. The save DC is Strength-based.

Each ally within 10 feet of it gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the pavbagha is conscious, not if it's unconscious or dead.  Fade (Su) As a standard action, a pavbagha can fade from sight, as invisibility, for up to 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive.  Stunning Claw (Ex) This ability functions like the Stunning Fist feat, except the pavbagha uses a claw attack instead of an unarmed strike. The servitor can use this ability five times per day. A successful DC 15 Fortitude saving throw negates this effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.																												
Peryton	4.00	1200	Medium	7	17, touch 13, flat-footed 14	42	7	7	3				30 ft., fly 60 ft.

If a peryton kills a humanoid foe with a critical hit, it can tear out the victim's heart with its wolf-like teeth as a free action. Any creature that witnesses this savage event must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shadow Mark (Su) As a free action, a peryton can make a ranged touch attack by flying over a humanoid target-the maximum range of this attack is 300 feet.  If the peryton hits, its shadow transforms to match the shadow of the creature struck. Once a peryton has established this link, it gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made against that target, and every time the peryton hits that target with an attack, the creature must make a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Phantom Stalker	4.00	1200	Medium	6	17, touch 12, flat-footed 15	45	7	7	2	flames of healing		vulnerability to cold	30 ft., fly 60 ft.

The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the phantom stalker's last successful attack. Phantom stalkers can also ignite flammable materials with a touch. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Death Throes (Ex) A phantom stalker reduced to 0 hit points or less expels a fiery blast equivalent to a fireball (caster level 6th) that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within 20 feet. A DC 15 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A phantom stalker never uses this ability if it would harm the one that summoned it, unless the summoner itself is to blame for the phantom stalker's destruction (i.e., if the summoner attacks the stalker or orders it into battle against opponents that clearly outmatch it).  Find Target (Sp) If the one who summoned the phantom stalker is slain while the stalker is on the Material Plane, the stalker can unerringly find the slayer as though guided by discern location. Once the slayer has been tracked and dealt with, the phantom stalker returns to its home plane.  Flames of Healing (Ex) Any magical attack against a phantom stalker that deals fire damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the phantom stalker to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.																												
Phycomid	4.00	1200	Small	0	17, touch 11, flat-footed 17	39	7	2	2				10 ft.		acid pellet +5 touch (2d6 acid plus spores)	5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 5, Dex 10, Con 15, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	4	0	10 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Acid Pellet (Ex) A phycomid attacks by firing a glob of acid from one of its several mushroom-like stalks. This attack has a range increment of 10 feet. A phycomid can fire up to six acid pellets per minute-during rounds in which the fungus has no acid pellets, it has no method of attacking at all and must wait until its acid stores replenish in 4 rounds before continuing a battle.  Spores (Ex) Any creature that takes damage from a phycomid's acid pellet (or consumes even a small portion of the fungus) becomes exposed to the fungus's spores. These spores grow quickly in living creatures. This affliction is a disease effect, although its course runs much faster than most diseases and is more poison-like in its speed, and like a poison, the spores "burn out" after a short period. A creature that is slain by a phycomid spore infestation bursts open in 1d4 rounds as a fully grown new phycomid emerges.  Phycomid Spores: Disease-injury or ingested; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Any ranged touch attack deals 1d6 points of acid damage.  Spore Infection (Ex) A creature hit by a phycomid's fluid globule attack must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d2 points of Constitution damage as tiny mushroomlike growths sprout from its body. Each minute (10 rounds) thereafter, until the victim receives a remove disease, heal, miracle, or wish, he takes 1 point of Constitution damage.  At Constitution 0, the victim dies and his body collapses to the ground, sprouting a new phycomid. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This ability is constant, but the pixie can suppress or resume it as a free action.  Special Arrows (Su) When a pixie fires an arrow from any bow, it can decide to change the arrow's properties by sprinkling it with magical pixie dust. Doing so is a free action as long as the pixie is the one who fires the arrow.  A pixie can generate a number of uses of dust equal to its Charisma score each day (16 uses per day for most pixies)-the dust is useless to another creature unless the pixie gives the dust freely. In this case, the pixie chooses what effect the dust will have on an arrow when it is applied, and it takes a standard action to apply the dust to the arrow. Once pixie dust is applied to an arrow, the pixie's chosen effect persists on the arrow for only 1 round. As long as an arrow is altered in this way, it does not inflict damage when it hits-it only causes its new effect. A pixie can choose any one of the following three effects when dusting an arrow. Save DCs are Charisma-based.  Charm: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be affected as though by a charm monster spell for 10 minutes.  Memory Loss: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be affected by a modify memory spell (this effect can only eliminate the previous 5 minutes of memory-a pixie typically uses this ability to make the target forget it encountered the pixie so it won't chase the pixie when he flees).  Sleep: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or fall asleep for 5 minutes.																												
Plantoid	4.00	1200	Medium	1	14, touch 12, flat-footed 12	42	6	2	4				fly 40 ft. (perfect)	4 tendrils +3 (1d4-1 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.

Moss Tendrils (Ex) A plantoid lashes out with several mossy tendrils when it attacks, gaining a +1 bonus on its grapple check for each tendril that hit its opponent.  Control (Ex) The tendrils of a plantoid inject a mind-controlling substance, which it injects as a free action as part of its grapple check. Anyone touched by the mossy tendrils must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or fall under control of the plantoid. This otherwise acts like the dominate person spell except that the plantoid must touch the target and it functions on any Medium humanoid or monstrous humanoid. Control lasts for as long as the plantoid maintains contact. The victim also gets another saving throw to resist as described under the dominate person spell, and once every 4 hours after control is initiated. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Create Servitor (Ex) Anyone who remains controlled by a plantoid for more than 24 hours becomes a plantoid servitor, all human reason irrevocably lost. A plantoid can only control and transform a single creature or servitor at a time.

Creatures caught in the area take 3d6 points of damage. A DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is a sonic effect.

Lightning Charge (Ex) A rock reptile can move up to four times its speed, rather than twice its speed, when charging.																												
Sand Stalker	4.00	1200	Large	7	16, touch 13, flat-footed 13	45	7	8	3				50 ft., burrow 30 ft.	bite +9 (1d8+6 plus poison)		10 ft.	5 ft.	attraction	Str 19, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 4, Wis 12, Cha 2	6	11	24 (36 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Attraction (Ex) The front four legs of a sand stalker are hollow. When a gust of air or wind blows across them, they create a hypnotic sound that can be heard by all creatures within a 100-foot spread. Those hearing this sound must make a successful DC 15 Will save or become entranced.  This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same sand stalker's attraction for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  An entranced victim takes the most direct route possible, walking toward the sand stalker. If the path leads into a dangerous area, (fire, over a cliff, and so on), that creature gets a second saving throw. Entranced creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sand stalker stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as the sand stalker's legs are subjected to wind. A bard's countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury, save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect paralysis and 1 Str; cure 1 save. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Sarcovalt	4.00	1200	Tiny	3	19, touch 15, flat-footed 16	34	6	7	5	ferocity	15		20 ft., climb 20 ft., fly 60 ft.

Attacks that sever its head (such as those of a vorpal weapon) do not kill it. If attacked by multiple creatures, it grapples one opponent, detaches its head (which continues to drain blood), and uses its body to continue attacking with spell-like abilities. Its head and body share a common pool of hit points but are otherwise treated as different creatures while separated. The head is AC 19, touch 15, flat-footed 16 (+3 Dex, +4 natural, +2 size) and can fly at the creature's normal speed. The head cannot initiate attacks on its own, and if removed from a target, it flies back to the body on its next turn. The body cannot see, but it can perceive through the head's eye cavities if it has line of effect to the head.  Disease Swarm (Su) A sarcovalt's vomit swarm ability summons a cloud of flies instead of spiders, which has a fly speed of 40 feet (good) and infects its target with filth fever (DC 12) instead of poison.  Disease (Ex) Filth Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d3 Dex and 1d3 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.																												
Satyr	4.00	1200	Medium	2	18, touch 13, flat-footed 15	44	4	8	8				40 ft.	dagger +6 (1d4+2/19-20), horns +1 (1d6+1)	short bow +6 (1d6/x3)	5 ft.	5 ft.	pipes	Str 14, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 19	4	6	18	PFRPG Bestiary	Pipes (Su) A satyr can focus and empower his magic by playing haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot radius must make a DC 18 Will save or be affected by charm person, fear, sleep, or suggestion, depending on what tune the satyr chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes' effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the satyr's other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use of his pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spelllike abilities, and if separated from them he may continue to use his standard abilities. The pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Sawdust Slough	4.00	1200	Large	-1	12, touch 8, flat-footed 12	57	10	1	-3	amorphous		vulnerable to fire	20 ft., climb 20 ft.	slam +7 (1d6+6)		10 ft.	5 ft.	engulf (DC 17, 1d6+6 bludgeoning plus choking chaff)	Str 18, Dex 8, Con 21, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	4	9	18 (can't be tripped)	Andoran Birthplace Of Freedom	Choking Chaff (Ex) A sawdust slough constantly releases particles of plant matter that form a cloud of choking dust around it. Creatures beginning their turns adjacent to a sawdust slough are coated with this dust, revealing invisible creatures (as glitterdust, though without any of that spell's other effects) and dazzling creatures as long as they remain adjacent to it and for 1d3 rounds thereafter. In addition, creatures that breathe that begin their turns adjacent to the sawdust slough are sickened for the same duration (Fortitude DC 18 negates). Creatures that hold their breath before being exposed to the choking chaff aura are immune to the sickening effect for as long as they hold their breath. The save DC is Constitution-based. A sawdust slough's choking chaff aura is burned off when it takes fire damage, and does not become active again until the end of the sawdust slough's next turn.  Flammable (Ex) Sawdust sloughs and the particulate cloud surrounding them are highly flammable, causing any damaging flame around them to flare up in gouts of fire. Any creature adjacent to a sawdust slough (including creatures engulfed by it) when it takes fire damage must  succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or take half as much fire damage as that dealt to the sawdust slough. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Scarecrow	4.00	1200	Medium	0	16, touch 10, flat-footed 16	47	1	1	1			vulnerability to fire	20 ft.	2 slams +8 (1d8+3 plus fear)		5 ft.	5 ft.	fascinating gaze	Str 16, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 14	5	8	18	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Fascinating Gaze (Su) Target is fascinated, 30 feet, Will DC 14 negates. Fascination lasts as long as the scarecrow remains within 300 feet of the fascinated creature. The approach or animation of the scarecrow does not count as an obvious threat to the victim of this particular fascination effect (although the scarecrow's attack does count as an obvious threat and ends the fascination immediately). This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Fear (Su) A scarecrow's touch infuses its target with overwhelming waves of fear. If the victim fails a DC 14 Will save, she cowers and can take no actions other than attempting a new DC 14 Will save at the end of the following round (and each round thereafter) to end this fear. A successful first save leaves the victim shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Scarecrow	4.00	1200	Medium	0	16, touch 10, flat-footed 16	47	1	1	1			vulnerability to fire	20 ft.	2 slams +8 (1d6+3 plus fear)		5 ft.	5 ft.	fascinating gaze	Str 16, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 14	5	8	18	Tome of Horrors Complete	Fascinating Gaze (Su) Target is fascinated, 30 feet, Will DC 14 negates. Fascination lasts as long as the scarecrow is "alive" or remains within 300 feet of the fascinated creature.  Note that the approach or animation of the scarecrow does not count as an obvious threat to the victim of this particular fascination effect (although the scarecrow's attack does count as an obvious threat and ends the fascination). This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Fear (Su) The touch of a scarecrow infuses its target with overwhelming waves of fear. If the victim fails a DC 14 Will save, he is cowering and can take no actions other than attempting a new DC 14 Will save at the end of the following round (and each round thereafter) to throw off the effects of this fear. A successful save leaves the victim shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.

This infuses the blades with disease from the demon's filthy spittle. Any creature struck by a schir's halberd must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or contract gray pox-a frightening disease that causes weakness, gray splotches on the skin, and eventual catatonia. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Gray Pox: Halberd-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.																												
Screamer	4.00	1200	Medium	7	17, touch 17, flat-footed 14	34	5	4	4	channel resistance +2, incorporeal, rejuvenation			fly 80 ft. (perfect)	incorporeal touch +6 (1d4 Charisma drain)		5 ft.	5 ft.	Charisma drain, malevolence, scream of hopelessness, suicidal frenzy	Str -, Dex 16, Con -, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 18	3	6	23	Tome of Horrors 4	Charisma Drain (Su) A screamer causes 1d4 points of Charisma drain each time it hits with its incorporeal touch attack. On each successful attack, it gains 5 temporary hit points.  Malevolence (Su) Once per round, a screamer can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the screamer's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability the screamer must try to move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 16 Will save, but the target adds (or subtracts) its Charisma modifier to this saving throw roll. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same screamer's malevolence for 24 hours, and the screamer cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, the screamer vanishes into the target's body. Screamers prefer to use this attack after having made several Charisma drain attacks to weaken a target's resistance. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Rejuvenation (Su) A screamer cannot be killed through simple combat. If reduced to 0 hit points it disappears only to reform 24 hours later. The only way for a screamer to be truly laid to rest is for it to die while possessing a host body with its malevolence ability. When the body dies, the screamer spirit ceases to exist.  Scream of Hopelessness (Su) Once every hour, a screamer can loose a horrific, mournful scream. Any living creature within hearing distance of this scream (it can carry up to a mile outdoors) must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear attack. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same screamer's scream of hopelessness for 24 hours. The effects of multiple screamers' screams cannot stack. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Suicidal Frenzy (Su) If a screamer succeeds in possessing a target with its malevolence ability, it immediately begins to make suicidal attacks on the possessed body with the body's own weaponry. Each round, the screamer uses the body's full attacks to direct its weaponry against itself. It uses the possessed victim's attack and damage modifiers and must only succeed on an attack against the body's flat-footed armor class. Damage, including the possibility of critical hits, is rolled normally. Due to the inhabiting spirit, the possessed body continues its attacks even between -1 and -9 hit points, though only single attacks can be made at this point. If the possessed body is made helpless the screamer departs to find another target. If the possessed body dies, the screamer's spirit is destroyed as it goes to its final rest.																												
Screaming Skull	4.00	1200	Tiny	-5	13, touch 7, flat-footed 18	33	2	0	2				0 ft., immobile			2-1/2 ft.	0 ft.	cacophony, insanity	Str 10, Dex -, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	6	4	9	Tome of Horrors Complete	Cacophony (Su) When a screaming skull detects movement within 40 feet, it emits an ear-shattering roar of tumultuous sounds as a free action that can be heard up to 1,000 feet away. All creatures within 60 feet that hear the sound must make a successful DC 13 Will save or take 1d6 points of sonic damage each round they remain in the area. The screaming also distracts spellcasters attempting to cast spells. A spellcaster within the area must make a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + sonic damage taken) to successfully cast a spell. The screaming lasts for 1d4 rounds before ceasing for one round. After that, the skull remains silent unless a creature is within or moves within 40 feet of it-it then screams again and repeats the above cycle. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Additionally, this cacophonous scream risks attracts wandering monsters. Whenever the skull first screams, the GM makes an additional wandering monster check to determine if nearby creatures come to investigate the source of the disturbance.  Insanity (Su) Physically touching the screaming skull (including attacks with natural weapons and unarmed attacks) requires the opponent to make a successful DC 13 Will save or be stricken insane as by an insanity spell (caster level 6th). The save DC is Constitution-based.

The target must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be staggered as strange nebulous distress and a gnawing sense of impending doom plagues the victim. If a sea hag uses her evil eye on someone already afflicted by this curse, the victim must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be overwhelmed with fright and collapse into a comatose state for 3 days. Each day that passes, the comatose victim must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or perish. The evil eye is a mindaffecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Evil Eye Curse: Gaze-failed save; save Will DC 14; frequency 1/day; effect staggered (or fall comatose if already under the effects of the evil eye).  Horrific Appearance (Su) The sight of a sea hag is so revolting that anyone within 60 feet (other than another hag) who sets eyes upon one must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or instantly be weakened, taking 1d6 points of Strength damage. Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same hag's horrific appearance for 24 hours. This is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or a DC 16 Heal check ends the ongoing acid damage. Multiple bites are cumulative. The save DC and check DC are both Constitution-based.  Lure (Ex) A serpent creeper has a special air sac in its throat that it can turn inside out. By doing so, the air sac appears to be a piece of low-hanging fruit. A serpent creeper uses this ruse to draw its prey in closer. When a serpent creeper does this, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks beyond its normal racial bonus.

The save DC is Charisma-based. Incorporeal Form (Su) A shadow rat swarm can, as a standard action, assume an incorporeal form for up to 1 hour per day. In this form, the swarm loses its natural AC bonus but gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC. While in this form, the shadow rat swarm is AC 16 (+2 deflection, +2 Dex, +2 size), touch 15, flat-footed 13. The shadow rat swarm can still swarm attack corporeal opponents while in its incorporeal form, but its attack only inflicts Strength damage and cannot distract foes or cause physical damage. The shadow rat swarm gains the incorporeal subtype while using this ability. Shadow Blend (Ex) A shadow rat swarm can disappear into the shadows as a move action, gaining total concealment in all levels of illumination save bright light. Strength Damage (Su) A shadow rat swarm deals Strength damage to living foes over which it swarms.

A shae can deal 1d6 points of cold damage with a touch. It adds +1d6 points of cold damage to any melee weapon damage it deals.  Lesser Shadow Evocation (Sp) This spell-like ability functions identically to the spell shadow evocation, but it can only create quasi-real versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation spells of 2nd level or lower. This spell-like ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

If damaged by fire, a shriezyx must make a successful Will save (DC equals the amount of fire damage dealt) or become frightened for 1 round.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save.  Slowing Toxin (Su) A shriezyx's web is coated with a supernatural toxin that numbs and deadens the nerves on contact. Any creature struck by a shriezyx's web must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become slowed (as the slow spell) for 1 minute. Each round, a victim may attempt a new DC 14 Fortitude save to end the effect early. This toxin fades quickly from spun webs-it can only affect targets on the round the web is spun. Existing webs remain sticky and tangled, but do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Skeltercat	4.00	1200	Medium	4	17, touch 15, flat-footed 12	37	6	8	4	mixed mind			40 ft.	bite +9 (1d6+4 plus grab), 2 claws +9 (1d4+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	musk, scream	Str 19, Dex 18, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 13, Cha 12	5	9	24	AP 92	Mixed Mind (Ex) A skeltercat's mind is a bizarre combination of animal instinct and human intellect. This disordered consciousness grants the creature immunity to confusion effects. Additionally, any creature that attempts to read a skeltercat's mind or communicate with it telepathically must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Musk (Ex) A skeltercat has glands that produce a noxious musk. Any living creature within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1 minute afterward. A creature that successfully saves is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds and can't be affected again by the same skeltercat's musk for 24 hours. This is a poison effect, and other skeltercats are immune to this effect. A skeltercat can suppress this effect as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Partial Transformation (Su) A skeltercat can alter portions of its body in order to give itself access to certain abilities. As a standard action three times per day, a skeltercat can gain one of the abilities listed below. A partial transformation lasts for 10 minutes. As a swift action, a skeltercat that has already activated a partial transformation can spend an additional use of this ability to switch which benefit it receives. Only one such benefit can be in effect at a time.  Climb: The skeltercat's claws extend, granting it a climb speed equal to half its base land speed. Additionally, when falling within arm's reach of a wall, ledge, or something else it could grab on to for stability, it can slow its descent, taking damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter.  Hide: The skeltercat's hide bristles like that of an angry cat and grows thicker, increasing its natural armor bonus by 2.  Legs: The skeltercat grows an additional pair of legs, bringing its total to six, increasing its base land speed to 60 feet, and granting it the rake special ability. The rake attacks use the same damage and critical threat range as the skeltercat's normal claw attacks.  Swim: The skeltercat grows webbing between its toes and whale-like flukes on its tail, granting it a swim speed equal to its base land speed. Additionally, it gains the hold breath universal monster ability.  Tail: The skeltercat's tail grows thick and clublike. It gains a tail slap as a primary attack that deals 1d6 points of damage plus trip on a successful hit.  Scream (Su) A skeltercat can release a terrifying cry that affects all creatures within a 300-foot spread. All creatures in that area must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against this effect can't be affected by the same skeltercat's scream for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A bless spell cast on the body before that time ceases the transformation. Adults and non-humanoids killed by a skull child do not rise as undead.  Daylight Powerlessness (Su) A skull child's energy drain, create spawn, terrifying gaze, and weakness abilities only function after sunset.  Masquerade (Su) Between the hours of dawn and dusk, it is impossible to tell a skull child from another, normal, child of the race it is posing as. Any form of detection, such as detect undead reveals nothing. True seeing or similar spells show a dark haze around a skull child during the day but nothing else. Additionally, Bluff is always a class skill for a skull child.  Terrifying Gaze (Su) Any living creature that meets the gaze of a skull child must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Creatures with more than 5 HD are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Vicious Claws (Su) The claws of a skull child are supernaturally sharp. A skull child threatens a critical on a 19-20 with its claw attack.  Weakness (Su) The bite of a skull child deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage on a successful hit unless the target succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save. A creature dies if this Constitution damage equals or exceeds its actual Constitution score. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The opponent must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be paralyzed-at the end of each round thereafter, the paralyzed victim can attempt a new Fortitude save to recover from this paralysis. When a victim recovers from a slithering tracker's paralysis, the victim is staggered for 1d6 rounds. This DC is Constitution-based.  Transparent (Ex) Because of its lack of coloration, a slithering tracker is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. The slithering tracker gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks as a result, and can move at full speed without taking a penalty on Stealth checks. A creature that fails to notice a slithering tracker and walks into it automatically takes damage as if struck by the slithering tracker's slam attack and is immediately subject to a grab attempt and paralysis by the ooze.

Creatures without an Intelligence score or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects cannot be detected using this ability.  Speed Burst (Ex) A sparksting swarm can increase its speed by 10 feet for 1d6 rounds. After using this ability, it must wait 1 minute before it can use it again.

The save DC is Constitution-based. Spines-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str and nauseated for 1 round; cure 1 save. Spines (Ex) A spear urchin's spines can swivel and rotate to face any approaching creature that attacks it. Any creature that attacks a spear urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack, or any Large or smaller creature that attacks with a onehanded weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the spear urchin's spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can poison the target as well. In addition, a spear urchin can fire up to two spines each round as if they were javelins with a range increment of 30 feet. As long as its target is within range of its tremorsense (30 feet), a spear urchin ignores its Dexterity penalty on ranged attack rolls, but beyond this range the penalty functions normally, effectively increasing a spear urchin's penalty to hit by -4 over its standard penalty for range. A spear urchin's spines function equally well underwater as they do above water.

Each time a tanuki takes a swig of sake, it becomes progressively drunker and takes a -1 penalty to its AC and on Reflex saves for 1 minute. These penalties stack.

Immunity to poison negates this effect.  Liquefy Organs (Ex) A tentamort can insert the needlelike projection from its stinging tentacle into the body of a foe grappled by either tentacle. Doing so requires a successful melee attack, and the tentamort cannot insert the projection into a creature grappled with its constricting tentacle if its stinging tentacle is also grappling a foe.  Once inserted, the tentamort injects a digestive liquid and a paralytic poison (see above) through the hollow barb that liquefies the victim's internal organs; the tentamort draws this liquefied slurry back through the hollow needle into its own body to feed. This attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the tube remains inserted in a foe.  Once the needle is removed or the tentamort is killed, the foe continues to take 1 point of Constitution damage until it succeeds at a DC 13 Fortitude save. This Constitution damage can be halted by spells or effects that remove disease or heal ability score damage (including lesser restoration).

This gives it a +20 bonus on Stealth checks and the ability to hide in plain sight for 1 round per Hit Die even when there is no cover, concealment, or shadow nearby. If it makes an attack, the thin man is no longer in its vanished state. It usually uses this ability when attempting to elude pursuit.

Horrific Appearance (Su) Any creature that witnesses a thognorok's horrific appearance could find itself overwhelmed with revulsion at the qlippoth's constantly sprouting and waving insectile legs, becoming sickened for 1d6 rounds (Will DC 13 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Starting on the round after the merope is consumed, the thriae soldier gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and saving throws, and gains fast healing 3.  Poison (Ex) Sting or arrow-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. As a free action, a thriae soldier can apply her venom to an arrow as she fires the shot. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Starlight Blast (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a thyrlien can tap into Desna's divine radiance and unleash a blast of holy twilight in a 5-foot burst. All creatures in this area take 2d4 points of holy damage, plus 1 point for each step their alignment deviates from chaotic good.  For example, a chaotic neutral or neutral good creature would take 2d4+1 points of damage, a neutral creature would take 2d4+2 points of damage, and a lawful evil creature would take 2d4+4 points of damage. A DC 14 Reflex save negates this damage.  Chaotic good creatures are unaffected by this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Tuyewera	4.00	1200	Medium	7	16, touch 13, flat-footed 13	39	4	5	6	daylight invisibility		vulnerable to sunlight	20 ft.	slam +7 (1d6+4), tongue +8 (1d4+4 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	constrict (1d4+4), lure, steal tongue, suffocation	Str 17, Dex 16, Con -, Int 8, Wis 13, Cha 15	4	7	20	AP 37	Daytime Invisibility (Su) During the day, a tuyewera is invisible as long as it doesn't attack. This effect functions as the invisibility spell, but lasts for the entire day. If a tuyewera takes any action that would negate its invisibility (such as attacking), it remains visible until it takes a full-round action to reactivate its invisibility. Lure (Su) If a tuyewera possesses a stolen tongue (see steal tongue ability), it can lure creatures into a trancelike state and compel them to approach as a standard action. When a tuyewera uses its lure, it must target an intelligent creature within 120 feet to which it has line of effect (but not necessarily line of sight). The tuyewera must concentrate to maintain the lure's effects. It then calls out to the creature, beckoning it to approach. The target can resist this lure by making a successful DC 15 Will save, after which that target is immune to that tuyewera's lure ability until the tuyewera gains a different tongue. If the tuyewera uses the target's name during the lure, the target suffers a -2 penalty on the Will save. If the target fails, she becomes fascinated and attempts to approach the tuyewera by the shortest, safest route possible. Once the target is adjacent to the tuyewera, she remains motionless and offers no resistance to the undead's attacks (although once the tuyewera attacks, it ceases concentration and the victim is free to act, assuming she survives the monster's attack). This is a sonic mindaffecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Suffocation (Su) A tuyewera does not breathe itself, but it can attempt to steal the breath of a helpless, fascinated, or stunned adjacent creature as a standard action. When the tuyewera attempts this, it moves its mouth next to the victim's mouth and inhales, drawing the victim's breath out of her body. The victim can attempt to resist this attack by making a DC 15 Fortitude save. If she fails, the victim is stunned for 1 round and begins to suffocate. The victim falls unconscious on the second round, drops to -1 hit points on the third, and dies of suffocation on the fourth. Each round, the victim may attempt a new DC 15 Fortitude save to end the suffocation effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Steal Tongue (Su) A tuyewera does not possess a tongue of its own when it is created-it must steal a tongue from a recently slain (no more than 1 day ago) creature before it can speak, attack with its tongue, or use its lure or constriction attacks. Stealing a tongue is a full-round action, after which the stolen tongue merges with the tuyewera's jaw. The tuyewera gains the ability to speak and understand all of the languages known by the dead body from which the tongue was harvested, and its voice sounds exactly like that of the dead creature while it still lived. The monster's new tongue is a dangerous weapon as well, and can extend to a length of nearly 5 feet to attack and constrict foes. A stolen tongue only lasts until the next sunrise, after which it rots away to corruption in a single round, forcing the tuyewera to seek out a replacement before it regains its speech and attacks.																												
Udaeus	4.00	1200	Medium	1	22, touch 11, flat-footed 21	38	7	2	2				20 ft.	#ERROR!	mwk javelin +5 (1d6+3)	5 ft.	5 ft.	infuse arms and armor, mythic power (1/day, surge +1d6)	Str 17, Dex 13, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 9	3	6	17	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Armor and Weapon Training (Ex) Udaeoi are proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, and shields (including tower shields).  Energy Resistance (Ex) An udaeus has resistance 30 against one type of energy. By performing a ritual that takes one day, an udaeus can change its energy resistance to a different energy type (either acid, cold, electricity, or fire). Most udaeoi choose fire resistance unless they expect to fight a creature using a specific energy type.  Fighter Training (Ex) An udaeus counts its racial Hit Dice as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. If it has levels in fighter, these HIt Dice stack.  Infuse Arms and Armor (Ex) Any improvised weapon an udaeus wields is treated as a comparable normal weapon. Any normal weapon an udaeus wields is treated as a masterwork weapon. Any masterwork weapon it wields is treated as a weapon with a magical +1 enhancement bonus. Any weapon with a magical enhancement bonus it wields is treated as though its enhancement bonus were 1 higher than its actual value (to a maximum of +6). This ability also applies to armor and shields (normal is treated as masterwork, masterwork is treated as +1, and +1 or higher is treated as 1 higher than actual).																												
Ukobach	4.00	1200	Small	8	17, touch 15, flat-footed 13	32	2	8	7		15		30 ft.	1 fire poker +5 (1d6-1 plus 1d4 fire) or 2 claws +5 (1d4- 1 plus 1d4 fire)	1 ember +10 (1d6 fire)	5 ft.	5 ft.	animate flames, fire breathing, scorch	Str 9, Dex 19, Con 13, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 13	5	3	17	AP 25	Animate Flames (Su) As a standard action, an ukobach can animate an existing fire of Small size or larger. Doing so requires an ukobach to make a DC 15 Wisdom check as it impresses its will upon the fire. This DC increases by +5 for every size category of the flame above Small. If an ukobach succeeds, the flame animates with the statistics of a fire elemental of the same size, and follows the ukobach's mental commands. The flames remain animate for a number of rounds equal to the ukobach's Wisdom modifier-usually 3-after which they return to being simple flames, setting the square they cease moving in alight or being extinguished, as their surroundings warrant. Up to five ukobachs can make use of the aid another action to each grant an adjacent ukobach a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check to animate flames (granting a maximum +10 bonus). Fire Leap (Su) As a swift action, an ukobach occupying the same space as a fire, pool of lava, vent of searing steam, or similar blaze can teleport from that burning feature and emerge from another within 100 feet. This ability functions similarly to the spell dimension door, but only between fires. Upon entering a flame, an ukobach is instantly aware of all flames within range through which it might exit. If an ukobach enters a flame and there are no others to exit through within 100 feet, the devil's movement immediately ends and it is stunned for 1 round. Firebreathing (Su) An ukobach can spend a standard action to guzzle a pint of oil, alcohol, or similarly flammable fluid and hold the combustible liquid within its body. At any point within 10 minutes of doing so, the ukobach can expel the liquid either as a 10-foot cone of fire or a 20-foot line of flame, both dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 13 for half). Upon breathing fire an ukobach cannot make use of this ability again until it drinks another pint of oil. The save DC is Constitution-based. Scorch (Su) An ukobach's touch is searing hot, causing its claws and any metal weapon it grasps to deal an additional 1d4 points of fire damage.																												
Umasi	4.00	1200	Medium	6	18, touch 12, flat-footed 16	42	6	6	5			immune to healing	40 ft.	dagger +7 (1d4+4/19-20), 2 unarmed strikes +7 (1d3+2  nonlethal)	shortbow +7 (1d6/x3)	5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 18, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 8	5	9	21	AP 39	Graft Flesh (Su) Umasi can graft the flesh and even limbs of other humanoids to their own bodies in a ritual that takes 1 hour to complete. To heal damage, an Umasi must have a supply of flesh (either living or dead), and the Umasi must make a DC 20 Heal check to treat deadly wounds. The Umasi can only heal damage with his graft flesh ability once per day, but there is no time limit on healing wounds and the Umasi does not need a healer's kit (and does not take a penalty for lacking one). This ability otherwise functions as the treat deadly wounds use of the Heal skill.  Umasi can also graft additional limbs onto their bodies; each extra arm gives the Umasi an additional unarmed strike, while each additional leg adds +5 feet to the Umasi's speed.  An Umasi can have a maximum of six arms and six legs.  Harvest Organs (Su) An Umasi can remove a vital organ when he delivers a coup de grace against a humanoid opponent with a slashing or piercing weapon. The next round, the Umasi can consume the harvested organ as a move action to gain the benefits of the death knell spell (caster level equal to the Umasi's Hit Dice).  Immortal Flesh (Su) Umasi are immune to disease and aging effects, and they gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.  Immune to Healing (Ex) Umasi do not heal damage naturally, and are not healed by positive or negative energy.																												
Vampire Spawn	4.00	1200	Medium	1	15, touch 11, flat-footed 14	26	3	2	1	channel resistance +2		resurrection vulnerability, vampire weaknesses	30 ft.	slam +4 (1d4+1 plus energy drain)		5 ft.	5 ft.	blood drain, dominate (DC 14), energy drain (1 level, DC 14)	Str 12, Dex 12, Con -, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 15	3	4	16	d20pfsrd	Blood Drain (Su) A vampire spawn can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire spawn establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The vampire spawn heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood. Dominate (Su) A vampire spawn can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire spawn targets must succeed on a Will save (DC 14) or fall instantly under the vampire spawn's influence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some vampire spawns might be able to affect different creature types with this power. Energy Drain (Su) A creature hit by a vampire spawn's slam (or other natural weapon) gains one negative level. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a vampire spawn makes. Fast Healing (Su)A vampire spawn also gains fast healing 2. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vampire spawn assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a vampire spawn forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round. Gaseous Form (Su) As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a vampire spawn destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. Shadowless (Ex) A vampire spawn casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror. Spider Climb (Ex)A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider climb spell. Weaknesses Vampire spawns cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire spawn-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire spawn must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire spawn at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire spawn can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save.

An unwilling victim must be grappled before the vendenopterix can use this ability. The vendenopterix's kiss inflicts 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma drain (her choice). The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another act of passion from the vendenopterix. The target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save to negate the suggestion. The save DC is Charisma-based. Poison (Ex) Claw-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)  A gray dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.  • Young-fog cloud;  • Juvenile-create water;  • Old-control winds;  • Ancient-control water;  Water Breathing (Ex) A gray dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.

The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.																												
Viduus	4.00	1200	Medium	4	16, touch 10, flat-footed 16	47	5	4	10		15		30 ft., climb 30 ft.	quill +5 (1d4 plus censor or expurgate)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 10, Dex 11, Con 18, Int 15, Wis 19, Cha 16	5	5	15	Inner Sea Bestiary	Censor (Su) A viduus that strikes a living creature with its quill can rewrite that creature's memories. The creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have its memories affected in a manner similar to the spell modify memory. The viduus can rewrite 1 day's worth of the target's memories with a single strike. As a result, the creature is either stunned or confused for the next 1d4 rounds (50% chance of either). At the GM's discretion, this might have longer-term effects. A creature's memories can be restored by lesser restoration, modify memory, or similar spells. Memories lost in this manner are copied into one of the numerous tomes protected by the viduus. This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC is Charisma-based.  Expurgate (Su) A viduus that strikes a dead creature-such as a soul, petitioner, or undead creature-with its quill can obliterate that creature's memories. The creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have all of its memories erased. It retains language and basic knowledge, but no details as to the events of its life. This typically leaves the creature calm and indifferent to all beings around it. This memory loss is permanent, though the memories can be restored by lesser restoration, modify memory, or similar spells. Memories lost in this manner are copied into one of the numerous tomes protected by the viduus. This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC is Charisma-based.  Transformation (Su) A viduus that is reduced to 0 hit points transforms. Its cocoon body bursts open, expelling a swarm of biting white-and-black centipedes (same statistics as a spider swarm) and a bank of mind fog centered on the viduus's square. A viduus can purposefully transform by spending three consecutive full-round actions, in which case it reforms somewhere in the Boneyard 1 month later.

A DC 16 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Lightning Bolt (Su) A voltar's lightning bolt has a range of 100 feet.  Vulnerable to Water (Ex) A voltar submerged in enough water to cover its entire body is immediately reduced to 0 hit points and explodes just as if it had used its death throes ability.

All creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become dazed for 1 round and then shaken for an additional 1d6 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save against a voonith's howl is immune to the same voonith's howl for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Every creature in a 30 ft. radius must succeed a DC 18 Reflex save or be hit by 1d4 daggers for 1d4+2 damage each. This attack is usually performed when the flower is mortally wounded or hopelessly outnumbered. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Thin Stem (Ex) A war flower has a thin and fragile stem. The thin stem makes it extremely vulnerable to slashing weapons. A war flower that suffers a critical hit from a slashing weapon must make a Fortitude save equal to DC 10 + the damage dealt or die as result of its stem being chopped in two.

Death Smoke (Ex) A witherweed that takes at least 1 point of damage from a fire effect releases a cloud of deadly smoke that billows forth and quickly fills a 20-foot radius surrounding it. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. One minute later, another Fortitude save (same DC) must be made to avoid another 2d6 points of Constitution damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

These elementals appear in adjacent squares. Each have half of the xocothian's current hit points and share the same mind. They can reform into the xocothian as a standard action if they are adjacent to each other-the reformed xocothian's hit points are equal to the total of the two elementals' hit points. If either elemental is slain, the xocothian must use its standard action on its next turn to reform (treat a slain elemental's hit points as 0 when determining the reformed xocothian's total hit points).  Speed Burst (Ex) A xocothian can fly or swim up to 200 feet as a full-round action. When using this ability, it must move in a straight line.

Self-Resurrection (Su) A slain yhohm remains dead for only 1d4 rounds unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate. Otherwise, a fully healed yhohm emerges from the remains 1d4 rounds after death, as if brought back to life via resurrection. The yhohm gains 1 permanent negative level when this occurs. A yhohm can self-resurrect only once per year. If a yhohm dies a second time before that year passes, its death is permanent. A yhohm that dies within the area of a desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until the desecrate effect ends, at which point the yhohm immediately resurrects. A yhohm brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a result.  Shroud of Flame (Su) A yhohm can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As long as its feathers are burning, it deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with each natural attack, and any creature within 5 feet must attempt a DC 14 Reflex save each round or take 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the yhohm with a natural or non-reach melee weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit.

Adamantine, cold iron, mithral, or metals with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher heal it double this amount. It takes a zentragt 1 minute to eat 5 pounds of metal.

Once per day, a zuvembie may call out, and all living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within a 100-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or move toward the zuvembie using the most direct means possible. If this path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the zuvembie simply stands and offers no resistance to the zuvembie's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the zuvembie continues its call as a standard action each round.  This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect, and has no effect on deaf creatures.

When determining the deformities of a typical aberrant, roll randomly or choose 1d4-1 deformities from the Aberrant Deformities table. If two deformities are contradictory, reroll or select another. Racial bonuses gained from different deformities are cumulative. For each deformity an aberrant possesses, it gains a -2 racial penalty on Charisma-based checks with non-aberrants except for Intimidate checks, where it instead gains a +2 racial bonus. Oversized Weapon Fighting (Ex) The twisted bodies of aberrants allow them to wield weapons designed for Huge-sized creatures without penalty, as if they were Large-sized weapons.

All creatures within 10 feet of the achaierai immediately take 2d6 points of damage as their flesh melts and rots away. The cloud erodes sanity as well as flesh, and anyone who takes damage from the black cloud must also make a DC 15 Fortitude save or become confused. Every round, the victim may attempt another DC 15 Fortitude save to recover from the confusion; otherwise it persists, lasting indefinitely until the condition is removed or the victim eventually makes her saving throw. The confusion element of a black cloud is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is a poison effect.  Achaierais are immune to this ability.

This ability has a range of 100 feet. Creatures caught in the area take 5d6 points of cold damage and the avalanche affects a creature as if hit with a bull rush (CMB +17). A DC 17 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Freezing Wind (Su) Once per day, as a standard action, an algidarch can create a freezing wind that functions as a wind wall spell (CL 7th) and that deals 5d6 points of cold damage (DC 17 Fortitude save for half) to creatures affected by the wind.

The demon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to attempt Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Mutilating Gouge (Ex) If the andrazku hits with both slams in the same round, its target must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Charisma damage.

Androids can never gain morale bonuses.  Emotionless (Ex) Androids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a -4 penalty on Sense Motive checks.  Nanite Surge (Ex) An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate action, an android can cause his nanites to surge, granting the android a bonus equal to 3 + the android's character level on any one d20 roll; this ability must be activated before the roll is made.

The next time the protected creature would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged attack, the attack is instead deflected and the protected creature takes no damage. An angelic guardian can only deflect one ranged attack per turn in this way. This effect lasts until the angelic guardian's next turn or until the protected creature leaves its square, whichever comes first.  Metallic Feathers (Ex) An angelic guardian's wings are honed to razor-sharp edges, and attacks with them deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

A creature with army ants clinging to him takes 3d6 points of damage at the end of his turn each round. As a full-round action, he can remove the ants with a DC 17 Reflex save. High wind or any amount of damage from an area effect destroys all clinging ants. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Consume (Ex) An army ant swarm can rapidly consume any creature it swarms over.

A new save must be made each round a creature remains within the affected area. A hallucination cloud persists for 5 rounds before dispersing-a strong wind causes it to disperse immediately. The save DC is Constitution-based. To determine what hallucination is suffered each round, roll 1d6 and consult the following table.  d6 Hallucination 1 You're sinking in quicksand! Fall prone and spend 1 round flailing your arms and legs as if trying to swim.  2 Attacked by a swarm of spiders! Spend a full round action to attack the floor near you with your weapon.  3 An item you hold has turned into a viper! Drop it and flee from the item at top speed for 1 round.  4 You're suffocating! Stand in place, hold your breath, and clutch at your throat for 1 round.  5 You've shrunk to 1/10th your normal size! Take no actions for 1 round and monsters won't see you.  6 You're melting! Grasp hold of yourself in an attempt to hold yourself together, and take no actions for 1 round.  Spores (Ex) Any creature struck by a basidirond's slam attack is coated with spores. The creature struck must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or these spores take root in his flesh, and particularly in his lungs. The save DC is Constititonbased.  Basidirond Spores: Disease-inhaled; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save.  Cold Lethargy (Ex) Although a basidirond is immune to cold damage, any cold effect it is exposed to slows it for 1d4 rounds. During this time, the basidirond cannot use its hallucination cloud or spores.																												
Basilisk	5.00	1600	Medium	-1	17, touch 9, flat-footed 17	52	9	4	5				20 ft.	bite +10 (1d8+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	gaze	Str 16, Dex 8, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 11	7	10	19 (31 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary	Gaze (Ex) Turn to stone permanently (as flesh to stone), range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 15 negates. A creature petrified in this matter that is then coated (not just splashed) with fresh basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk no more than 1 hour dead) is instantly restored to flesh. A single basilisk contains enough blood to coat 1d3 Medium creatures in this manner.  The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Bearded Devil	5.00	1600	Medium	6	19, touch 12, flat-footed 17	57	9	7	3		16		40 ft.	glaive +11/+6 melee (1d10+6 plus infernal wound) or 2  claws +10 melee (1d6+4)		5 ft.	5 ft. (10 ft. with glaive)	beard	Str 19, Dex 15, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 10	6	10	22	AP 36	Beard (Ex) If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both claw attacks, it also lashes at the same target with its spiky, filthy beard. The victim takes 1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or contract devil chills. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Devil Chills: Disease-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Infernal Wound (Su) The damage a bearded devil deals with its glaive inflicts persistent wounds that cause 2 points of bleed damage. Bleed caused from an infernal wound is particularly difficult to stanch-a DC 17 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 16 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects on the victim. The infernal wounds caused by a bearded devil are a supernatural ability of the devil, not of the weapon.																												
Black Skeleton	5.00	1600	Medium	8	20, touch 14, flat-footed 16	45	4	6	5	channel resistance +4			40 ft.	2 short swords +10 (1d6/19-20 plus 1d3 Strength damage) or 2 claws +9 (1d4 plus 1d3 Strength damage)		5 ft.	5 ft.	superior two-weapon fighting	Str 11, Dex 19, Con -, Int 13, Wis 10, Cha 14	5	5	19	Tome of Horrors Complete	Strength Damage (Su) A black skeleton's attacks (either by a weapon or natural attack) deal 1d3 points of Strength damage to a living creature. This is a negative energy effect. This is a function of the black skeleton itself, not its weapons. Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex) A black skeleton usually fights with a short sword in each hand. Because of its magical nature, its Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with both weapons at no penalty.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stagnation Aura (Su) A blightspawn's stagnation aura causes lethargy and torpor in those who approach it, sapping energy and speed. When a creature comes within 20 feet of a blightspawn, it must make a DC 16 Will save to avoid being affected as per the spell slow, for as long as the creature remains within the blightspawn's aura and for an additional 1d3 rounds after leaving it. Once a creature successfully saves against the aura, it is immune to that particular blightspawn's aura for 24 hours; otherwise, re-entering the aura forces a creature to save again. In addition, this aura fouls liquids of all types within the area. A creature that drinks anything in a blightspawn's aura (including potions and alchemical elixirs) must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Blood Golem	5.00	1600	Large	5	16, touch 10, flat-footed 15	38	4	3	5			vulnerability to magic	30 ft., swim 30 ft.	2 slams +7 (1d8+3 plus blood consumption)		10 ft.	5 ft.		Str 17, Dex 12, Con 10, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 1	5	9	20 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Blood Consumption (Su) Each time a blood golem hits a living opponent with a slam attack, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. These bonus hit points are added to the blood golem's total even if the addition takes it above its current maximum hit points. A blood golem cannot gain more hit points than the maximum hit points allowed by its HD (not including any bonus hit points it may have from its Con score). For example, a 7-HD blood golem cannot gain more than 56 hit points. If a blood golem successfully hits an opponent with both of its slam attacks in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking 2d4 points of Constitution damage (DC 15 Fortitude save for half). A blood golem gains 5 hit points per point of Constitution damage it deals. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. When a blood golem reaches its maximum hit points for its Hit Dice, it divides (see cell division, below). Cell Division (Ex) When a blood golem absorbs enough blood to raise its hit points to the maximum for its HD, it splits into two identical blood golems, each with half the original's hit points. For example, a 7-HD blood golem that reaches 56 hit points splits into two 7-HD blood golems with 28 hit points each. Vulnerability to Magic (Ex) A blood golem is slowed (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds by any cold-based attacks or effects. A purify food and water spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a blood golem. A blood golem can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + caster's ability score modifier) to reduce the damage by half.																												
Blood Orchid	5.00	1600	Large	5	18, touch 10, flat-footed 17	52	5	5	8				5 ft., fly 30 ft.

It cannot be flanked.  Blood Drain (Ex) On a successful grapple check with two or more tentacles against a single foe a blood orchid can pull the grappled creature to the mouth on its underside as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The mouth latches on and drains blood from the victim. Each round it maintains its grapple, the blood orchid automatically deals 1d4 points of bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's blood.  Poison (Ex) Tentacle-injury; save DC 16 Fort; frequency 1/ round for 4 rounds; effect unconsciousness; cure 1 save.  Telepathic Bond (Ex) Blood orchids communicate through a non-magical telepathic bond. They can sense emotions in other blood orchids at a distance of 100 ft. or less, and emotions in other creatures at a range of five feet. They can communicate mentally with each other through full telepathy at a distance of 20 ft. or less, and can share knowledge very rapidly when touching each other.																												
Blood Pudding	5.00	1600	Medium	0	10, touch 10, flat-footed 10	52	3	1	1			racial vulnerabilities	30 ft.	slam +4 (2d4+1 plus grab)		5ft.	5ft.	disgorge, infuse	Str 12, Dex 11, Con 20, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 7	3	+4 (+12 grapple)	18	Tome of Horrors Complete	Disgorge (Ex) A blood pudding that has infused itself with a host can force the creature's blood out through its pores, eyes, ears, and mouth. This is a standard action that deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round.  At Constitution 0, the host dies and the blood pudding feeds on the corpse. When sated, the pudding exits, and to onlookers it appears as if the slain creature is bleeding profusely.  Infuse (Ex) A blood pudding that makes a successful grapple check can forcibly merge its form with that of a living creature. If it succeeds, the blood pudding's form disappears as it soaks through skin, wounds, and any other opening in the host's body. This special attack deals no damage but allows the blood pudding to use its disgorge special attack (see above).  A creature infused with a blood pudding can try to forcibly eject the creature once per round as a standard action (coughing it up, vomiting, and so on). This requires a successful DC 17 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A creature can be affected by the pudding's infuse attack again, but gains a +2 conditional bonus on its Fortitude save. This bonus lasts for one day and is effective against the infuse attack of that blood pudding only.  Racial Vulnerabilities (Ex) Drinking alcohol weakens an infused pudding and reduces the Constitution damage sustained from its disgorge attack by one-half for the next 1d4+1 rounds.  Consuming pure vinegar causes an infused blood pudding to eject itself from the host in the same round the vinegar is consumed. A creature drinking pure vinegar must make a successful DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A blood pudding will not use its infuse attack against that host for one day.  A blood pudding hit with a cold effect or attack is slowed for 3 rounds (as the slow spell) and loses its racial bonus to grapple checks for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level.  Slime Grapple (Ex) because of the sticky slime it secretes, a blood pudding gains a +4 racial bonus to grapple checks.

Boggart	5.00	1600	Small	4	21, touch 16, flat-footed 15	39	3	6	6				20 ft.	slam +9 (2d6 electricity)		5 ft.	5 ft.	confusion, electrical discharge, feed	Str 12, Dex 19, Con 15, Int 14, Wis 12, Cha 14	4	4	19	Tome of Horrors Complete	Change Shape (Su) A boggart's natural form is that of a small humanoid (resembling a young gnome, halfling, or goblin). It has one other form: that of a small, immature will-o'-wisp.  In humanoid form, a boggart assumes the same appearance and traits of its form, much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid form, a boggart retains all of its special attacks and special qualities.  The second form is that of a will-o- ‘wisp. In this form, a boggart is nearly indistinguishable from a normal will-o'- wisp, but a DC 18 Knowledge (dungeoneering) or Perception check reveals that the boggart is in fact smaller and brighter. A boggart can assume either form as a standard action, though it cannot maintain either one for longer than 1 minute (10 rounds). A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the boggart revert to its true natural form when slain.  A true seeing spell reveals the boggart's natural form if it is in will-o'-wisp form.  Confusion (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, a boggart can unleash a screech that confuses all those hearing it within 30 ft. of the boggart. The confusion lasts for 6 rounds. An affected creature can make a DC 15 Will save to negate the effects. Each additional boggart within 10 feet that joins the screeching increases the save DC by +1.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Detect Thoughts (Su) A boggart can continuously detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 8th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.  Electricity (Su) A boggart delivers 2d6 points of electricity damage with a successful slam attack (DC 15 Fortitude for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Electrical Discharge (Su): Once every other round as a standard action, a boggart can discharge a bolt of electricity in a 10-foot line. The bolt deals 2d6 points of electricity damage (DC 15 Reflex save for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Feed (Su) When a boggart slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.  A boggart advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a boggart devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an aberration of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill ranks, feats, and ability score improvements normally.  The boggart only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A boggart that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a will-o'-wisp upon completion of the act.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) Boggarts are immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except magic missile, protection from evil, magic circle against evil, and maze.																												
Bogwid	5.00	1600	Medium	8	19, touch 14, flat-footed 15	47	5	5	1				30 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.	2 slams +7 (1d6+4 plus nauseating touch)	offspring +7 ranged touch (1d2 bleed plus disease)	5 ft.	5 ft.	ravenous young	Str 19, Dex 18, Con 18, Int 3, Wis 4, Cha 13	3	7	21 (33 vs. trip)	AP 62	Disease (Ex) Bogwid Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 16, onset 1 day, frequency 1/day, effect 1d2 Str damage and shaken, cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC save is Constitution-based.  Nauseating Touch (Ex) The bogwid's touch is disgusting. Creatures hit by its slam attack must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Ravenous Young (Ex) Each round, a bogwid can launch one of the offspring clinging to its back at a target within 10 feet as a ranged touch attack. On a successful hit, the offspring attaches itself to the target and begins draining blood, automatically dealing 1d2 points of bleed damage each round (and possibly infecting the target with bogwid fever). As a full-round action, a creature can attempt to remove one of these offspring, either by bludgeoning it with a fist or pulling it off. Either way, removing an offspring kills the larval creature. Someone other than the target the offspring is attached to can also perform this action. Anyone using a weapon to kill or remove an attached offspring deals half of the damage to the creature to which the offspring is attached. A bogwid can launch up to 10 offspring per day before it must rest and gestate more larval young.  Revolting Aura (Ex) The bogwid is both visually and odoriferously revolting. Any creature within 10 feet of a bogwid must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened. This effect persists as long as the creature is within the aura and for 2 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same bogwid's revolting aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Boobrie	5.00	1600	Large	2	17, touch 11, flat-footed 15	67	8	8	5			marsh bound	30 ft., swim 30 ft.	2 claws +11 (1d8+3/19-20), bite +11 (2d6+3)		10 ft.	10 ft.	wail	Str 17, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 3, Wis 14, Cha 12	9	13	25	Tome of Horrors 4	Change Shape (Su) A boobrie can assume the form of a Large heavy warhorse as a standard action. In this form, it can run on top of water (including deep water such as rivers and lakes) and marshy ground as if it were solid, flat terrain. The boobrie is still marsh bound in this form and suffers the normal penalties if it moves too far from its environment.  Marsh Bound (Ex) A boobrie can survive away from its marshy home for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, refer to the drowning rules.  Wail (Su) Once every 2d4 rounds as a standard action, a boobrie can emit an eerie wail that deals 4d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures within 40 feet that hear it. A DC 18 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Further, a creature failing its save is paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting attack. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the wail of that boobrie for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus from the boobrie's Ability Focus feat.																												
Brethedan	5.00	1600	Large	0	17, touch 9, flat-footed 17	66	7	2	9	amorphous			0 ft., fly 30 ft. (good)	2 slams +9 (1d6+4 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	constrict (1d6+4), engulf (DC 17, 1d6 acid and paralysis)	Str 19, Dex 11, Con 20, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 11	5	+10 (+14 grapple)	20 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Adaptation (Ex) A brethedan's body is extremely mutable, and can adapt to respond to virtually any situation. Once per round as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a brethedan can reshape its body and chemistry to adopt any of the following qualities.  • It gains resistance 5 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). • It gains an additional natural attack (bite, tentacle, etc.) with damage appropriate to its size.  • Its slam damage type changes to slashing or piercing. • Its slam damage die increases by one step (from 1d6 to 1d8 for most brethedans).  • It gains a +4 natural armor bonus to AC.  • Its reach increases to 20 feet. A brethedan can only have one modification in effect at any one time-if it selects a new adaptation, it loses any other in effect. More extreme adaptations are also possible (at the GM's discretion), but generally take days or even months to adopt.  Combine (Ex) Thanks to their perfect communication, brethedans can combine to work together as parts of a larger organism. As a swift action, a brethedan adjacent to another can merge with it, becoming a single creature occupying both spaces. The merging brethedan forfeits its actions to augment the other, and adds its hit points (though not its Hit Dice) to the new creature's collective total. At this time, it also chooses one adaptation-the combined creature gains this benefit, and it cannot be changed unless the combined creature uses its single adaptation action each round to do so. Any number of brethedans can merge in this fashion, but each adaptation can be gained only once (though resistances to multiple energy types are allowed). The combined creature retains the ability to swap one adaptation each round (not once per component creature). Splitting into the component creatures again is a full-round action in which all component creatures are released and the remaining hit points are divided evenly. For the purposes of Hit Die-related effects, the Hit Dice of a combined brethedan are equal to those of the component creature with the highest CR.																												
Brimorak	5.00	1600	Small	7	18, touch 14, flat-footed 15	57	9	8	3	boiling blood	16	vulnerable to cold	30 ft.	longsword +11/+6 (1d6+3/19-20 plus 1d6 fire), hoof +0  (1d3+1 plus 1d6 fire)		5 ft.	5 ft.	breath weapon (20-foot line of boiling blood, 5d6 fire damage, Reflex DC 17 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), burning hooves	Str 17, Dex 16, Con 19, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 15	6	8	21	Book of the Damned V2	Boiling Blood (Su) A brimorak's blood is boiling hot. It can cough out a hideous amount of this scorching fluid as a breath weapon, but the blood also serves the demon as a defensive ability. Any creature that damages a brimorak with a slashing or piercing melee weapon is sprayed by boiling blood, and takes 1d4 points of fire damage with each successful hit with such a weapon. Creatures using reach weapons are not subject to this damage.  Burning Hooves (Su) A brimorak's hooves burn with fire, leaving scorched hoofprints on wood, stone, and most every other solid surface, yet this supernatural fire does not set alight surfaces the demon treads upon. It does make it easier to track a brimorak, though-Survival checks made to track a brimorak gain a +8 circumstance bonus. Brimoraks use their air walk ability to throw creatures off their trail, or to leave their prints in strange places (like atop roofs) to spread fear and terror. Against a prone foe, a brimorak can make two hoof attacks rather than just one.  Flaming Weapon (Su) As a free action, a brimorak can infuse a wielded melee weapon (including a two-handed weapon, but not a second weapon held in the off-hand) with its fiery nature, allowing it to inflict an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with the weapon. This fire damage stacks with any additional fire damage that the weapon might also inflict. The weapon loses this ability if it leaves the demon's grasp.  Smoke Breath (Su) A brimorak's breath manifests as clouds of foul-smelling smoke when it exhales. This breath surrounds the brimorak out to a radius of 5 feet-while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision or choke foes, it is enough to sicken breathing foes who are not immune to poison. A DC 17 Fortitude save grants immunity to a particular brimorak's breath for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Buggane	5.00	1600	Large	3	18, touch 8, flat-footed 18	51	7	4	6			light blindness	30 ft., burrow 30 ft.	2 claws +11 (1d8+6), gore +11 (1d8+6)		10 ft.	10 ft.	rend (2 claws, 1d8+9), smash and bash	Str 22, Dex 9, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 13, Cha 6	6	13	22	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Blind (Ex) Bugganes are blind. They are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.  Earth Distortion (Su) Once per minute as a swift action, a buggane can empower itself to completely ignore the physicality of stone and metal, enabling it to pass through stone and metal barriers as easily as air. Until the beginning of the buggane's next turn, the buggane has earth glide and takes no damage from stone or metal weapons, or from the natural attacks of creatures of the earth subtype or stone or metal constructs. Additionally, a buggane's melee attacks ignore any AC bonus (including enhancement bonuses) from metal or stone armor and shields. While using earth distortion, the buggane cannot damage stone or metal constructs or creatures of the earth subtype with its natural attacks.  Smash and Bash (Ex) As a free action, a buggane can attempt to trip an opponent it damages with its rend attack without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the trip attempt fails, the buggane cannot be tripped in return. If the trip attempt is successful, the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Carrion Moth	5.00	1600	Large	4	20, touch 13, flat-footed 16	45	4	6	8				30 ft., climb 15 ft., fly 60 ft.

Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become confused for 2d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same carrion moth's drone attack for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stench (Ex) When a carrion moth dies, its carcass splits open and releases a foul-smelling gas. All living creatures (except other carrion moths) within 5 feet of the carcass must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the nauseated creature. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Catrina	5.00	1600	Medium	7	19, touch 13, flat-footed 16	51	5	8	9		16		30 ft.	2 slams +6 (1d8)		5 ft.	5 ft.	compel condemned, kiss of death	Str 10, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 19	6	6	19	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Calm Emotions Aura (Su) A catrina's aura acts like a calm emotions spell with a radius of 30 feet. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that catrina's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Compel Condemned (Su) As a standard action, a catrina can force one humanoid within 30 feet to make a DC 17 Will save or be affected as per the spell dominate person. This ability functions exactly as that spell, but the catrina can only command an affected creature to approach and kiss her. This action is not considered to be against the target's nature or self-destructive. Any damage taken by the target (other than damage the catrina deals) immediately ends this effect.  Kiss of Death (Su) A catrina can kill a grappled, helpless, or willing target with a long, passionate kiss. The target must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 5d6 points of damage. Any creature damaged by the same catrina's kiss for three consecutive rounds instantly dies, regardless of how many hit points it has remaining. Creatures of the old age category take a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist this ability, while those in the venerable age category take a -4 penalty. This is a death effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.																												
Cayhound	5.00	1600	Medium	6	18, touch 12, flat-footed 16	51	5	7	6				40 ft.	bite +11 (1d10+7 plus 1d6 sonic and trip)		5 ft.	5 ft.	righteous bite, thunderous bark	Str 21, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 13	6	11	23 (27 vs. trip)	Inner Sea Bestiary	Righteous Bite (Su) A cayhound's bite is treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  Thunderous Bark (Su) Once every 1d6 rounds, a cayhound can bark with the concussive force of a thunderbolt. Every creature within a 15-foot cone-shaped burst must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or take 3d8 points of sonic damage and be knocked prone. A successful saving throw reduces this damage by half and negates being knocked prone. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Unbound (Su) Cayhounds move as if under a continuous freedom of movement spell.  They are immune to dimensional anchor, but are affected by dimensional lock normally.																												
Cecaelia	5.00	1600	Medium	4	18, touch 14, flat-footed 14	45	4	9	6				30 ft., swim 40 ft., jet 200 ft.	mwk spear +11/+6 (1d8+4/x3), 2 tentacles +5 (1d4+1 plus grab)	mwk spear +12 (1d8+3/x3)	5 ft.	5 ft.

This ink cloud provides total concealment and persists for 1 minute.  Tentacle Sense (Ex) As a swift action while swimming and while it is not grappled or grappling, the cecaelia can spread its tentacles wide to form a sensory net around it. This grants blindsight to a range of 10 feet and lasts as long as the cecaelia concentrates. While this effect lasts, the creature cannot attack with its tentacles or move.																												
Cervapral	5.00	1600	Medium	4	18, touch 14, flat-footed 14	51	5	9	7		16		50 ft.	gore +11 (1d6+2), mwk rapier +11/+6 (1d6+2/18-20)		5 ft.	5 ft.	powerful charge (gore +11, 2d6+3)	Str 14, Dex 18, Con 17, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 14	6	8	22	Andoran Birthplace Of Freedom	Enchantment Sense (Ex) Cervaprals have an innate sense for magical compulsion and control. A cervapral can attempt a Sense Motive check to sense an enchantment as a move action, rather than requiring the normal 1 minute.  Mercies (Su) A cervapral's lay on hands ability removes disease (as remove disease) and fatigue in addition to curing damage.  Pronghorn (Ex) A cervapral's gore attack is considered a primary natural weapon, even when used in conjunction with a weapon attack.  Sprint (Ex) Once per minute, a cervapral can move at 10 times its normal speed (500 feet) when it makes a charge.																												
Church Grim	5.00	1600	Small	2	15, touch 15, flat-footed 13	37	6	6	5	incorporeal, rejuvenation		limited domain	fly 40 ft. (perfect)	incorporeal bite +8 (1d6 holy plus 1d4 Wisdom)		5 ft.	5 ft.	howl	Str -, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 14	5	6	18	Tome of Horrors Complete	Howl (Su) The howl of a church grim causes any evil creature within its limited domain (its churchyard; see below) to make a successful DC 16 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Good or neutral creatures are completely unaffected by the howl as long as they are not there to steal from the dead or attack the church. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same church grim's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Know Alignment (Su) A church grim makes automatically knows the alignment of any creature that enters its churchyard. This ability can be dispelled, but the church grim can reactivate it the following round as a free action.  It cannot extend this ability beyond the limits of its domain, however.  Limited Domain (Ex) The realm of a church grim encompasses only the churchyard it defends; it can wander freely in its cemetery and any adjoining church grounds, but it cannot move beyond; it must stop at the boundary of consecrated land.  Rejuvenation (Su) It is difficult to destroy a church grim through simple combat. A slain church grim restores itself within 24 hours. Even the most powerful spells are often only temporary solutions. A church grim that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its churchyard with a successful level check (1d20 + the church grim's HD) against DC 16.  The only sure way to get rid of a church grim is to raze the church it protects and cast unhallow on the churchyard.  Soul Defender (Su) It is the sacred duty of a church grim to defend the bodies and souls of those buried in its churchyard. Any attempts to cast an animate dead or similar spell to create undead within the confines of an area guarded by a church grim requires the caster to make a successful DC 20 caster level check. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Whether the check succeeds or not, the caster incurs the full wrath of the church grim immediately.  Wisdom Damage (Su) The incorporeal bite of a church grim deals 1d6 points of holy damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to the target. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save negates the Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  On each successful attack that does Wisdom damage, the church grim gains 5 temporary hit points.

Creatures in the area must succeed on DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 1d6 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same churr's howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Cloaker	5.00	1600	Large	7	19, touch 12, flat-footed 16	51	6	5	7	shadow shift			10 ft., fly 40 ft. (average)	bite +8 (1d6+5), tail slap +3 (1d8+2)		10 ft.	10 ft.

The cloaker attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its attack roll. It can still use its whip-like tail to strike at other targets. Attacks that hit an engulfing cloaker deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. Moan (Ex) A cloaker can emit an infrasonic moan as a standard action, with one of four effects. Fear: All creatures in a 30-foot spread must save (Will negates) or become panicked for 2 rounds. Nausea: All creatures in a 30-foot cone must save (Fortitude negates) or fall prone and be nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. Stupor: A single creature within 30 feet is affected by hold monster for 5 rounds (Will negates). Unnerve: Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those in the area for more than 6 consecutive rounds must save (Will negates) or enter a trance, helpless until the moaning stops. Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mind-affecting attacks. A creature that successfully saves against the cloaker's fear, nausea, or unnerve moans cannot be affected by that same moan effect from that cloaker for 24 hours. All of the save DCs against a cloaker's moan are DC 15. Save DCs are Charisma-based. Shadow Shift (Su) When in dim illumination, a cloaker can manipulate shadows as a free action to create one of three effects: blur (lasts 1d4 rounds, self only), mirror image (CL 6th), or silent image (DC 15, CL 6th, save DC is Charisma-based).

The corpse candle can create these lights within 20 feet of itself, covering an area in a 10- foot radius spread (usually underwater). Creatures viewing the pattern within 50 feet must make a successful Will save (DC 18) or become fascinated. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that corpse candle's hypnotic lights for one day. The lights remain for as long as the corpse candle concentrates plus 1 minute. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  A fascinated victim moves toward the lights, taking the most direct route available at its normal movement rate. The creature avoids certain dangers (walking off a cliff, walking through fire, etc.) and skirts around such obstructions if possible, but it will swim towards the light if necessary, paying no heed to the need for air. If no path to the light is available, the fascination is broken. Any living creature within the area of light at the end of its turn takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. This is a death effect.

When striking with its hands in this manner, it deals piercing damage instead of bludgeoning with its slam attack.  Stalagmite Form (Ex): Once per round as a swift action a crag man can transform itself to or from the form of a stalagmite of equivalent size. This stalagmite is the crag man's natural form; while in this form it does not radiate magic and true seeing does not reveal its humanoid form.

The crypt thing can only affect creatures of which it is aware and to which it has line of sight. A successful DC 16 Will save negates this effect. An affected creature is teleported in a random direction (roll 1d8, with 1 indicating north and the other numbers indicating compass going clockwise) and a random distance (1d10 x 100 feet) away from the crypt thing; determine each creature's direction randomly. A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space to the determined destination, but must appear on a solid surface capable of supporting its weight. If there is no appropriate destination in that direction, the creature does not teleport at all. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Crypt Thing	5.00	1600	Medium	6	17, touch 12, flat-footed 15	56	5	4	7	channel resistance +4			30 ft.	2 claws +7 (1d6+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	teleport other (DC 20)	Str 12, Dex 14, Con -, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 16	5	6	18	Tome of Horrors Complete	Claws (Ex) A crypt thing's claws are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Teleport Other (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a crypt thing can teleport all creatures within 50 feet of it to a randomly determined location. An affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save to negate the effects. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. An affected creature is teleported in a random direction (roll 1d4: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; 4, west) and a random distance (1d10 x 100 feet) away from the crypt thing. Roll randomly for each creature that fails its saving throw. A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space at the determined destination. A teleported creature can arrive in mid-air rather than on a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes. A creature that arrives in mid-air takes falling damage when it contacts a solid surface (unless it has some means to prevent falling, such as the ability to fly, or a feather fall spell).																												
Crystalline Golem	5.00	1600	Medium	-1	17, touch 9, flat-footed 17	44	2	1	2			vulnerability to sonic	30 ft.	2 slams +11 (1d6+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	crystalline destruction	Str 16, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	8	11	20	Tome of Horrors 4	Crystalline Destruction (Ex) When reduced to 0 hit points, a crystal golem shatters in an explosion of jagged shards of rock. All creatures within a 10-foot burst take 3d6 points of slashing damage and 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage; a DC 13 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A crystal golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that have the sonic descriptor. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: A transmute rock to mud spell slows a crystalline golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.

Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or be blinded for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures to whom sunlight is harmful or unnatural take 2d6 points of damage from the light. Undead creatures caught within the area take 3d6 points of damage, and undead particularly vulnerable to sunlight, such as vampires, take 3d8 points of damage. Creatures that cannot see or perceive objects through the use of vision are unaffected by the blindness, but still suffer damage if they are vulnerable to sunlight. Constitution Damage (Ex) A crystalline horror that confirms a critical hit with a claw attack deals 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss when it hits a creature. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by a crystalline horror's claws. Crystal Claws (Ex) A crystalline horror's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Shard Spray (Ex) A crystalline horror can loose a spray of razor-sharp shards of glass from its body in a 40-foot cone. A creature in the area takes 4d6 points of damage or half that amount if it succeeds on a DC 18 Reflex save. The crystalline horror can launch only five such sprays in a given day. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Curse Devil	5.00	1600	Small	8	20, touch 16, flat-footed 15	39	5	9	7	natural invisibility			20 ft., fly 40 ft.

All creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become cursed as bestow curse; additionally, all creatures in the area must succeed at a second DC 16 Will save or have their memories of the event stripped as if by modify memory. The curse devil can resume its invisibility at the end of its turn as a free action. Whether or not the saves are successful, an affected creature is immune to that curse devil's anathematize ability for 24 hours. If its natural invisibility is negated by other methods, the curse devil can't use this  ability. Those who can see invisible creatures are immune to this effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Broken Curses (Ex) When a curse devil dies, any lingering curses or harmful effects caused by the devil are undone as if by a miracle spell.  Infernal Bond (Ex) When a curse devil is created by a lesser or greater devil, its creator forges a magical link between the curse devil and a mortal signed to-or implicated in-an infernal contract, such as a mortal who sold her soul to a devil or the first-born child of a mortal who was promised in an infernal bargain). Thereafter, the curse devil can always find the specified mortal as though guided by a locate creature spell with no maximum range. The specified mortal takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against the curse devil's anathematize ability and its spell-like abilities.

A daochyn that is grappling with its tongue automatically deals this damage each round to the grappled opponent for as long as it maintains the grapple. A daochyn that is grappling an opponent with its tongue cannot use its bite attack.																												
Dark Caller	5.00	1600	Medium	3	17, touch 14, flat-footed 13	52	4	9	1			light blindness	30 ft.	mwk dagger +10/+5 (1d4+2/19-20 plus black smear poison)		5 ft.	5 ft.	death throes, sneak attack +2d6	Str 14, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 18	6	1	14	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Death Throes (Su) When a dark caller is slain, its body bursts into shreds of blisteringly cold shadows, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures within a 10-foot burst take 1d4 points of Strength damage and are staggered for 1 round. A successful DC 16 Fortitude save halves the Strength damage and negates the staggered effect. This ability damage is temporary and an affected creature's Strength returns to normal after 3d10 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Shadow Ritual (Su) Three dark callers can collaborate on a ritual that calls an owb (see page 210) to their service. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete. If the dark callers involved are distracted in any way, the attempt is ruined and the ritual must begin anew. Once called to their service, the owb serves them for 24 hours. Though the owb is free-willed, it follows orders to the best of its ability.																												
Dawn Piper	5.00	1600	Medium	8	18, touch 15, flat-footed 13	45	5	9	3		16		30 ft.	mwk rapier +8 (1d6+2/18-20)		5 ft.	5 ft.	dissonance (every 1d4 rounds, 15-ft. cone, 6d6 sonic damage, Reflex DC 16 half ), elemental font	Str 15, Dex 18, Con 16, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 17	3	12	23 (can't be tripped)	AP 68	Dissonance (Su) Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a dawn piper can use a musical instrument to unleash a deadly torrent of sonic vibrations that tears at the very physicality of its enemies. This is similar to a breath weapon that deals 6d6 points of sonic damage in a 15-ft. cone (Reflex DC 16 half ). A dawn piper must be in possession of a musical instrument in order to use this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Elemental Font (Su) A dawn piper can infuse a 40-foot-radius area with the primal qualities of the First World. The creation of an elemental font requires a musical instrument and a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. As long as the piper returns to it every 24 hours, a font can persist forever, but it is destroyed immediately upon the creator's death. A dawn piper can also destroy its own font as a full-round action. The dawn piper gains additional spell-like abilities based on a single element while within range of its elemental font. Dimensional anchor and dimensional lock stop the flow of power, preventing the piper from using the additional spell-like abilities. The save DCs are Charisma-based, and the spell-like abilities are cast at caster level 7th.  Air: 2/day-fly, gust of wind (DC 15), shocking grasp  Earth: 2/day-grease (DC 14), spiked pitAPG (DC 16), stone callAPG  Fire: 2/day-burning hands (DC 14), fireball (DC 16), pyrotechnics (DC 15)  Water: 2/day-aqueous orbAPG (DC 16), hydraulic pushAPG, slipstreamAPG  Terrible Beauty (Su) As a standard action, a dawn piper can surround itself in an intense aura of magnificence that is too potent for non-fey to withstand. Non-fey creatures within a 30-foot radius of the dawn piper must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be blinded or deafened for 1d4 rounds (the piper's choice, but the effect is consistent for all affected creatures), and take 1 point of bleed damage from their eyes or ears (depending on the specific effect). This aura lasts 1 full round, and a creature that succeeds at its saving throw cannot be affected again for 24 hours. This is a visual or auditory, mind-affecting effect. A dawn piper requires a musical instrument in order to create this aura. The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based.

Excretions from these larvae have a paralyzing effect, leaving the host helpless until the larvae mature into young deadfall dwellers that erupt from the host's body, killing it. Each day, an impregnated host must attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. If the host succeeds at the saving throw, it is no longer helpless, but is still impregnated. If it fails, it takes 1 point of Constitution drain and remains helpless for another day. All of the larvae in an impregnated creature can be destroyed with a remove disease spell. Alternatively, a creature can take 10 minutes to attempt a DC 20 Heal check to remove a single larva. This check can be attempted multiple times, but each attempt deals 1d6 points of damage to the host. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dexterity damage; cure 1 save.  Spittle (Ex) As a swift action, a deadfall dweller can emit a stream of corrosive spittle at one target within 30 feet. On a successful attack, the target takes 1d6 points of acid damage, and must save to avoid being entrapped by the solidifying mucus.

The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  Snake Empathy (Ex) Snakes, including giant snakes, do not willingly attack a death's head inphidian, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the death's head inphidian attacks a snake, its protection against that creature ends.  Death's Head Staff (Ex) The staff of a death's head inphidian can hold poisons in a specially crafted chamber inside the jewel encrusted snake skull. The chamber holds enough poison to deliver three doses. Most death's head inphidians fill the chamber with their own poison (use the stats above).  In lieu of poisoning an opponent struck by the staff, a death's head can command its staff to grapple and constrict its target. When a foe is successfully hit by the staff, the death's head inphidian can make an immediate grapple check as a free action. If successful, the opponent is pinned and takes 1d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage each round until it escapes. (Use the death's head inphidian's statistics above to resolve the grapple and escape.) This staff functions only in the hands of a death's head inphidian. In the hands of any other creature, it acts as a normal quarterstaff. The gem-encrusted snake skull is worth a total of 1,000-3,000 gp.																												
Demonic Mist	5.00	1600	Medium	9	16, touch 16, flat-footed 10	47	8	9	20	amorphous	16	vulnerability to wind	fly 50 ft.

It cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects.  Psychic Crush (Su) Three times per day, as a standard action, a demonic mist can attempt to crush the mind of a single creature within 40 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Will save or take 3d6 points of damage and become sickened for 1d4+1 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Vulnerability to Wind (Ex) A demonic mist is treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.																												
Derhii	5.00	1600	Large	3	18, touch 12, flat-footed 15	59	5	8	6				30 ft., climb 30 ft., fly 60 ft.

This is the equivalent of a charge, granting a +2 bonus on the attack roll and a -2 penalty to AC.  Booming Voice (Ex) A derhii can use its own booming voice as a signal. The sound can be heard up to 12 miles away as a thrumming in the air that conveys 20 words of information in 5 minutes.  Knockdown (Ex) When a derhii confirms a critical hit with a two-handed weapon, it has a chance to knock an opponent prone in addition to the damage dealt by the critical hit. If the derhii's confirmation roll exceeds its opponent's CMD, the opponent is knocked prone as if from the trip combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity, nor can the derhii be tripped if the confirmation roll fails to exceed the CMD.																												
Devil Dog	5.00	1600	Medium	6	15, touch 12, flat-footed 13	45	7	7	10			vulnerability to fire	50 ft.	bite +9 (1d6+3 plus trip)		5 ft.	5 ft.	throat-rip	Str 15, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 10	6	+22 (+26 grapple)	39 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Throat-Rip (Ex) As a full-round action, a devil dog can deliver a coup de grace against a helpless opponent. If the victim survives the attack, he must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Opponents killed in this manner cannot be raised, but resurrection, true resurrection, or the like can restore the slain creature to life.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Megaswarm Traits (Ex) Megaswarms are not so called because of the size of the swarm but rather the size of the creatures that compose the swarm. Unlike normal swarms, megaswarms are composed of Small creatures which are usually a megafauna version of a normal swarm and otherwise behave in a swarmlike manner. There are usually around 100 creatures in a megaswarm. The net effect is that they take only half damage from piercing weapons but take normal damage from other weapons. In addition when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or lower and breaks up, unless the damage was dealt by area-affecting attacks, then 2d6 surviving members of the megaswarm continue their attack, though now only as individual creatures. Otherwise, a megaswarm conforms to all of the other swarm traits as described in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary.

The djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Plane of Air. They are said to be made of the stuff of clouds, with the strength of the mightiest storms. A djinni is about 10 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.																												
Drelb	5.00	1600	Medium	7	15, touch 15, flat-footed 12	50	6	8	3	incorporeal			20 ft., fly 20 ft.

To the onlooker, it appears as if the drelb is retreating. Creatures succeeding on a DC 20 Will save see through this illusion; otherwise, the drelb advances into melee range and its opponent is considered flat-footed for the drelb's next attack following the use of this ability. A creature that has seen a drelb use this ability before gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +5 racial bonus.  Nether Chill (Su) A living creature touched by a drelb must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or immediately drops anything it is holding and fall prone, shivering for 1 round. It is not helpless but is unable to make any actions during this round.  The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus for the drelb's Ability Focus feat.  Psionic Adaptation (Su) A drelb can imitate any psionic power or psi-like ability used within 30 feet of it as a standard action. A drelb has a manifester level of 5th.  The save DC (if any) to resist an imitated psionic power or psi-like ability is 12 + the level of the power. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Further, any psionic power or psi-like ability that directly targets a drelb is reflected back on the attacker with full effect (manifester level and save DC equal to that of the original manifester).																												
Ectoplasm	5.00	1600	Large	1	11, touch 11, flat-footed 10	47	6	2	-4	incorporeal			fly 30 ft.

Affected opponents must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be affected as if by a sleep spell (caster level 7th). A successful save renders a creature immune to that ectoplasm's breath weapon for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Glow (Su) An ectoplasm continually gives off light with the approximate brightness of a candle. It cannot consciously extinguish this light. When an ectoplasm is killed, this light fades to darkness. Manifestation (Su) An ectoplasm dwells on the Ethereal Plane and as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When an ectoplasm manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal. A manifested ectoplasm can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ectoplasm can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ectoplasm always moves silently. Strength Damage (Su) The touch of an ectoplasm deals 1d8 points of Strength damage to living opponents. Undead Bane (Su) Against corporeal undead, an ectoplasm deals 1d8 points of Strength damage and 1d8 points of damage. Ectoplasms ignore the damage reduction of corporeal undead.																												
Elder Thing	5.00	1600	Medium	2	18, touch 12, flat-footed 16	59	8	4	8				30 ft., fly 20 ft.

While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep. An elder thing can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes- while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a hibernating elder thing. If it is jostled or damaged while hibernating, an elder thing can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 1d4 days to awaken from hibernation. An elder thing can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, an elder thing needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary.  Limited Starflight (Ex) An elder thing can survive in the void of outer space, and its wings allow it to use its fly speed in that environment despite the lack of air. Unlike creatures with full starflight, an elder thing's ability to fly in outer space does not allow it to reach unusually high speeds-an elder thing that wishes to travel from one planet to another typically calculates the distance and then hibernates for the majority of the journey, relying on its momentum and inertia to carry it to its destination while it slumbers along the way.

Str 20, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 15	5	10	24 (28 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Fear (Su) Each creature within a 30-foot radius that sees a fachen must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same fachen's fear aura for 24 hours. This is a paralysis effect and a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Incredible Balance (Ex) Despite its strange anatomy, a fachen is adept at keeping itself upright and out of danger. A fachen gains a +3 dodge bonus to AC and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD against trip combat maneuvers.																												
Fear Guard	5.00	1600	Medium	6	17, touch 17, flat-footed 14	51	6	4	6	channel resistance +2, incorporeal		daylight vulnerability	fly 30 ft.

Daylight Vulnerability (Ex) A fear guard exposed to natural sunlight (not merely bright light) suffers 2d6 points of damage per round of exposure and is slowed (as the spell).																												
Fen Witch	5.00	1600	Medium	1	14, touch 11, flat-footed 13	39	5	6	7		15		30 ft.	2 claws +9 (1d4+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	death speak (DC 15), mind probe (Will DC 15)	Str 17, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 15	6	9	20	Tome of Horrors Complete	Death Speak (Su) A fen witch who knows an individual's true name can speak that name as a swift action. If the individual hears the fen witch speak its name, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or perish. If the save succeeds, that creature cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's death speak for 24 hours. Note that the fen witch does not need to speak a language the creature understands in order to affect it; she only needs to speak its true name. Other fen witches or creatures who hear the target's true name cannot use this ability; it only functions for the fen witch after she has used her mind probe ability on the target. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Whether the fen witch's Death Speak ability is successful or not, the target's name remains fresh in her mind for 24 hours. After that, she must use her mind probe ability again to retrieve a creature's true name.  Hag (Ex) A fen witch counts as a hag for the purpose of joining a hag's coven.  Horrific Appearance (Su) The sight of a fen witch is so revolting that anyone within 60 feet (other than another fen witch or hag) who sets eyes upon one must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or instantly be weakened, taking 1d8 points of Strength damage. Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's horrific appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Mind Probe (Su) As a full-round action, a fen witch can peer into the mind of a living creature within 60 feet in an attempt to extract the creature's true name. The target can resist the mental trespassing by succeeding on a DC 15 Will save. If the save fails, the fen witch has learned the creature's true name and can use her death speak ability. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or less and creatures with no Intelligence score are immune to this ability. Psionic creatures can use defense modes or other psionic abilities to counter this probe. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's mind probe for one day. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  Swamp Stride (Ex) A fen witch can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a fen witch normally.																												
Fire Eel	5.00	1600	Large	6	19, touch 11, flat-footed 17	51	8	9	4				swim 40 ft.	bite +12 (2d6+9 plus grab)		10 ft.	5 ft.	fire shroud	Str 22, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 11	6	+13 (+16 grapple)	25 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Fire Shroud (Ex) A fire eel constantly secretes highly flammable oil from its body. Upon contact with the air, the oil bursts into flames. The oil normally burns for 1 minute before extinguishing itself. Anyone contacting the burning oil takes 3d6 points of fire damage.  Underwater, a fire eel can release this oil quickly (as a swift action) in a 10-foot radius around its body. The oil automatically ignites at the start of the fire eel's next turn. It deals the same fire damage as above, but only burns for 5 rounds underwater. A fire eel can ignite its oil once per minute in this way.																												
Fire Phantom	5.00	1600	Medium	6	16, touch 10, flat-footed 14	38	4	4	6	channel resistance +4		vulnerability to cold	30 ft.	2 slams +10 (1d4+4 plus 1d6 fire))	fire blast +7 touch (2d6 fire)	5 ft.	5 ft.	fire, fire blast, immolation, rage	Str 19, Dex 14, Con -, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 14	5	9	21	Tome of Horrors Complete	Fire (Ex) A fire phantom's fists are swathed in elemental fire. Any melee hit deals fire damage. Creatures attacking a fire phantom unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage each time their attacks hit.  Fire Blast (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a fire phantom can hurl a small globe of elemental fire to a range of 30 feet (no range increment). By making a successful ranged touch attack, it deals 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature hit must make a successful DC 15 Reflex save to avoid catching on fire.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Immolation (Su) Normally used as a last resort, a fire phantom can detonate itself in an inferno of elemental fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. This instantly kills the fire phantom if it fails a DC 20 Will save.  Even if the fire phantom survives, its flames are extinguished for 1 minute. During this time the fire phantom cannot use its fire blast ability and cannot deal fire damage with its slam attack. It retains the fire subtype. After 1 minute, its fires relight and it may deal fire damage normally and use its fire blast ability. If the fire phantom survives the immolation it may not use it again for one day.  Rage (Ex) A fire phantom is in a constant state of agony from the elemental fire that consumes its body. Therefore, it is always in a berserk rage and gains Str +4 and -2 AC (both already included in the statistics block above). The fire phantom cannot end this rage voluntarily and it cannot be suppressed or negated.																												
Flame Drake	5.00	1600	Large	5	18, touch 10, flat-footed 17	57	8	6	6			vulnerability to cold	20 ft., fly 60 ft.

This attack has a range of 180 feet and deals 5d6 points of fire damage (DC 16 Reflex half) to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius spread. Once a flame drake has used its fireball breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a flame drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.																												
Fogwarden	5.00	1600	Medium	3	16, touch 16, flat-footed 12	22	2	4	4	electricity discharge (DC 13, 3d6 electricity)		vulnerability to sunlight	fly 40 ft.

This is otherwise identical to an animate dead (caster level 4th). The animated creatures resemble zombies (and use their stats) and are under the control of the fogwarden that animated them. They are not undead however, and cannot be turned or rebuked. If the fogwarden is slain or moves more than 20 feet from a zombie, the animated creature collapses dead and cannot be animated again. Electricity Discharge (Su) Electricity constantly plays across a fogwarden's form. Any metal object (including metal weapons) that contacts a fogwarden's body takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Magic items receive a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to reduce the damage by half. Nonmagical items and objects receive no save and automatically take full damage. A creature holding the object or weapon at the time of contact takes 3d6 points of electricity damage as well (DC 13 Reflex save for half). Gaseous Form (Ex) The fogwarden's natural form is that of fog or mist. This ability is similar to the gaseous form spell (caster level 8th), except that a fogwarden does not lose its supernatural abilities or its lightning bolt ability, and has a fly speed of 40 feet. It is immune to and cannot perform combat maneuvers. Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex) Fogwardens shun sunlight. A fogwarden exposed to sunlight is staggered for as long as it remains in the sunlight, and is destroyed utterly after 1 hour of exposure if it cannot escape.																												
Forester's Bane	5.00	1600	Large	0	17, touch 9, flat-footed 17	52	10	1	2				0 ft.

This attack deals 1d4+3 points of slashing damage per stalk. It cannot attack a pinned opponent with any stalk that has already attacked another opponent that round. A forester's bane can only attempt to grapple opponents 1 or more sizes smaller than itself.  Because of its four leaves, it can grapple up to four different opponents at one time with a single grapple check. It can also attack a single opponent with more than one leaf, gaining a +2 bonus on its grapple check with each extra leaf (+13 grapple with two leaves, +15 grapple with three leaves, and +17 grapple with all four leaves).  Both leaves and stalks each have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a forester's bane's leaf or stalk does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the leaf is currently grappling a target, the forester's bane takes a -4 penalty on its opposed roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a leaf or stalk deals no damage to a forester's bane. Attacks that hit a leaf deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.  Destroyed leaves and stalks grow back in 2d4 weeks if the forester's bane is not killed.																												
Four-armed Gargoyle	5.00	1600	Medium	6	16, touch 12, flat-footed 14	57	6	7	5				40 ft., fly 60 ft. (average)	4 claws +8 (1d6+2), bite +8 (1d6+2),  gore +8 (1d6+2)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 15, Dex 14, Con 18, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 7	6	8	20	Tome of Horrors Complete

A living creature struck must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage.  Thereafter, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save each minute (10 rounds) or take 1 point of Strength damage.  This cycle continues until the creature dies or receives a remove disease spell.  A successful DC 20 Heal check or a delay poison spell slows the continuing damage to 1 point per hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Sickening Aura (Su) As a free action, a fungus gargoyle can emanate an aura that smells like rotting vegetable matter in a 10-foot radius. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as they remain in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterwards. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Gargoyle Stone Idol	5.00	1600	Medium	2	20, touch 12, flat-footed 18	47	1	3	1	rejuvenation			30 ft.	2 claws +9 (1d8+4), bite +9 (1d6+4), gore +9 (1d6+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	breath weapon (30-ft. cone, 4d6 fire damage and see below, Reflex DC 14 half, usable every 1d4 rounds)	Str 19, Dex 14, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 7	5	9	21	Tome of Horrors 4	Immunity to Magic (Ex) A stone idol is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone idol (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the stone idol's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.  A disintegrate spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol.  A chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight spell deals 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells.  Rejuvenation (Su) Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in 1d4+2 days.  Site Bound (Ex) A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it is brought back into the area.  Breath Weapon (Su) The stone gargoyle's breath weapon is a cone of superheated steam and water.

Two or more gearghosts working together on a trap can increase the maximum CR by 2 for each additional gearghost working in concert. For example, three gearghosts working together can create any CR 8 or lower trap in a week. Example traps can be found on page 420 of Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.  Rejuvenation (Su) A destroyed gearghost reforms in 2d6 days. To permanently destroy a gearghost, holy water must be poured over its remains within the area of a hallow spell. To complete the destruction, every trap within 100 feet of the remains must be successfully disabled or destroyed before the gearghost is completely destroyed.  Resetter (Ex) A gearghost can reset traps and keep them repaired with supernatural efficiency. A gearghost can reset a trap with a repair or manual reset as a move action.

All critical threats made against targets within the aura (including the genthodaemon) are automatically confirmed. Dying creatures within the aura take a -10 penalty on stabilization checks. The genthodaemon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action.  Barbed Defense (Su) A creature that strikes a genthodaemon with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d4+4 points of piercing damage from the barbed wire and other pieces of jagged metal embedded in the genthodaemon's body. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger their users in this way.  Penetrating Slivers (Ex) When a genthodaemon confirms a critical hit with a claw attack, pieces of its metal nails break off and enter the target's body, working their way toward its heart. When the slivers reach the heart 1d3 rounds later, the creature takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. The slivers are destroyed by anything that removes curses, diseases, or death effects. Likewise, creatures immune to curses, diseases, and death effects are immune to this ability.  Shrapnel (Ex) A genthodaemon can shake loose four large pieces of the shrapnel embedded in its body as a standard action (make a separate attack roll for each piece). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets of this attack must be within 30 feet of each other. The daemon can launch at most 24 pieces of shrapnel in any 24-hour period.

This requires a successful ranged touch attack. A creature hit is slowed (as the slow spell, caster level 6th) for 6 rounds if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save.

Creating a sand trap takes 1 hour. A DC 15 Perception check allows a creature to realize such a depression in the sand is in fact a trap. Any creature that steps into the trap slides to the center if it fails a DC 14 Reflex save-such victims take no damage, but they do fall prone. A giant ant lion can make an attack of opportunity against any creature that falls to the bottom of its sand trap. These creatures can move across sand traps at their normal speed and are immune to the trap's effects. Other creatures can navigate the trap's walls with a DC 20 Climb check.

Creatures without internal organs or Constitution scores are immune to the ability damaging effects of the assassin bug's liquefy organs attack.  Sticky Pads (Ex): An assassin bug's forelegs are covered in thousands of tiny hairs that secrete a sticky residue aiding the creature in climbing as well as securing its prey.  An assassin bug has a +4 racial bonus on Climb checks and on grapple checks (already figured into its statistics block).

Quills (Ex) Any creature attacking a giant blowfish with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons, or an unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of piercing damage. A creature that grapples a giant blowfish takes 2d6 points of piercing damage each round it does so. Creatures damaged by a giant blowfish's quills must also save or be poisoned.  These gigantic cousins of common blowfish, covered in poisonous spearlike quills, can reach up to 10 feet in size, and nearly double that when fully inf lated.

If the hand has no current quarry, it automatically gains the next creature it damages as its quarry. Once attuned to a target, it becomes aware of the target's location as if under the effect of a continuous locate creature spell. The hand gains a +1 bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks made to seek out and destroy the marked quarry. The mark quarry ability lasts until the quarry or the hand is slain.  Pus Burst (Su) When damaged by a piercing or slashing melee weapon, a spray of vile pus strikes the attacker unless the attacker makes a DC 15 Reflex save. Weapons that provide reach protect the attacker completely from a pus burst.  Creatures struck by pus become nauseated for 1d3 rounds and take 2d6 points of negative energy damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

In addition to the normal effects of a charge, the creature charged must make a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds. This is a fear effect.

It cannot be flanked. Amorphous (Ex) A gibbering mouther's body is malleable and shapeless. It is immune to precision damage (like sneak attacks) and critical hits, and can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or oneeighth its space when squeezing. Blood Drain (Ex) On a successful grapple check after grabbing, several of the creature's mouths attach to its target. Each round it maintains its grapple, its mouths automatically deal 1d4 points of bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's blood. Engulf (Ex) This ability functions as swallow whole, except for the following changes. An engulfed creature is trapped in the gibbering mouther's body, where several of its mouths continue to feed and drain blood. A gibbering mouther can engulf only one foe of its size or smaller at a time. If an engulfed creature cuts its way free (the mouther's damage reduction still applies to those inside), the mouther simply flows together again and can still use its engulf attack. Gibbering (Su) As a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit a cacophony of maddening sound. All creatures other than gibbering mouthers within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mindaffecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same mouther's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Ground Manipulation (Su) At will as a standard action, a gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth under its body to grow soft and muddy. The ground remains muddy for 1 minute after the mouther moves off of the location. A gibbering mouther can move through these areas with ease, but other creatures treat them as difficult terrain. Spittle (Ex) Each round as a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit a stream of acidic spittle at one target within 30 feet. On a successful attack, the target is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless he succeeds on a DC 18 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

As the undigested remains accumulate inside of it, the globster grows more and more bloated. As a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a globster can regurgitate these foul remains along with portions of its own mass. Doing so causes the globster 1d6 points of damage, but creates a new, fully grown globster that immediately attacks the nearest non-globster target. A globster can create spawn up to once per day, though only after it has fed upon at least four Medium-sized creatures (or the equivalent number of creatures of other sizes).  Decompose (Ex) A slain globster decays into a mass of goo in the span of 24 hours. However, the  corpse retains the creature's stench aura for 1d10 days after its death.  Nausea (Ex) Any creature struck by a globster must make a DC 18 Fortitude save to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. Once a creature makes this saving throw, it is immune to further nausea effects from that particular globster for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This functions as a deeper darkness spell (CL 6th).  Incorporeal Touch (Su) By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the gloom haunt inflicts 7d6 damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.  Pain Touch (Su) A gloom haunt adds its Charisma modifier on damage rolls with its incorporeal touch. Additionally, the touch of a gloom haunt sends a wave of intense pain through the opponent's body. A creature touched must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round and shaken for 1d4+2 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shadow Mastery (Su) A gloom haunt is a creature of darkness. In areas of total darkness (including that created by its creeping shadows ability), a gloom haunt gains a +2 racial bonus on attack rolls, saves, and checks. These bonuses are not included in the statistics block.  Shadowy Resolve (Su) In areas of shadowy illumination or total darkness, a gloom haunts channel resistance increases to +4.

A graeae coven can be composed entirely of graeaes, or could or include hags or witches with the coven hex. A hag or witch with the coven hex counts as a graeae for purposes of joining a graeae's coven. Likewise, a graeae counts as a hag for purposes of joining a hag's coven.  Eye of the Graeae (Su) Each graeae possesses a mystic eyeball. A graeae can sense the location of her eyeball from anywhere on the same plane. She must remain within 30 feet of her eyeball or she becomes completely blind and cannot use any of her spell-like or supernatural abilities. The eyeball only works for its graeae. If a graeae is slain, her mystic eye instantly turns to dust. Fate Casting (Su) A graeae has the ability to predict future events. On a creature's request, a graeae can expend a use of mythic power as a full-round action to answer a single question as if by the divination spell.  Luck Ripple (Su) A graeae can use her mystic eye to alter the circumstances of any creature within 30 feet. As a swift action, she can cast her eye on a single creature, causing the target to take a -2 penalty or gain a +2 bonus to one of the following (graeae's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. A successful DC 19 Will save negates the effect, which otherwise lasts for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting gaze effect. The DC of the save is Intelligence-based.

Magic Weapon (Su) A graven guardian that carries its deity's favored weapon treats that weapon as a +1 weapon as long as it is wielded by the guardian. If the weapon is a melee weapon, it gains the keen weapon special ability (even if the weapon is a bludgeoning weapon). If it is a thrown weapon, it gains the returning weapon special ability. If it is a ranged weapon, it gains the seeking weapon special ability, and generates new ammunition with each attack (this ammunition is destroyed whether or not it hits).

Great diadem urchin venom is shockingly painful and feels acidic at the moment of contact-though the worst of the pain fades after a moment. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spines (Ex) A great diadem urchin's spines can swivel to face any approaching creature. Any creature that attacks a great diadem urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack, or any Large or smaller creature that attacks with a one-handed weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the hunter urchin's spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can poison the target as well.																												
Green Hag	5.00	1600	Medium	1	19, touch 11, flat-footed 18	58	6	7	7		16		30 ft., swim 30 ft.	2 claws +13 (1d4+4 plus weakness)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 19, Dex 12, Con 12, Int 15, Wis 13, Cha 14	9	13	24	PFRPG Bestiary	Weakness (Su) A green hag's claws sap strength from those she strikes. Each time a green hag hits a foe with her claw attack, the victim takes 2 points of Strength damage unless he resists the weakness with a DC 16 Fortitude save. Alternatively, a green hag can attempt to inflict even greater weakness on a foe by making a touch attack-this variant requires a standard action, and cannot be attempted in the same round the hag makes claw attacks. The opponent touched must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. Mimicry (Ex) A green hag can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near its lair.																												
Grey Spirit	5.00	1600	Medium	3	17, touch 17, flat-footed 14	51	6	5	5	channel resistance +4, incorporeal, rejuvenation			fly 30 ft. (perfect)	incorporeal touch +8 (2d6 cold plus energy drain)		5 ft.	5 ft.	energy drain (1 level, DC 17), ravages of death gaze	Str -, Dex 16, Con -, Int 11, Wis 11, Cha 18	4	7	24	Tome of Horrors 4	Harbinger (Su) The appearance of a grey spirit is usually a harbinger of some future catastrophe, such as a great storm or a shipwreck. Such events occur within 1d6 days of the sighting of a grey spirit. Note that the grey spirit does not cause this catastrophe, rather she predicts it.  Ravages of Death Gaze (Su) Any living creature that sees the face of a grey spirit suddenly knows her pain, frustration, and rage, and has glimpse of the anguish of what it is like to die broken hearted. Any opponent experiencing this tragic emotion must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be stunned for 2d6 rounds. A creature stunned by a grey spirit is wrought with despair, weeping and wailing uncontrollably. A calm emotions spell ends this effect. This is a mind-affecting effect A creature who succeeds on the save cannot be affected by the same grey spirit's gaze for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the grey spirit's Ability Focus feat.  Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a grey spirit through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a grey spirit is to confront her with irrefutable evidence of her loved one's death. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different grey spirit by the GM.

Str 18, Dex 8, Con 19, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 15	7	11	20 (24 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Death Flood (Su) When a grodair is killed, it immediately explodes in a 15-foot-radius burst of highly pressurized water that deals 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 17 half ). After the explosion, a successful DC 25 Survival check allows a creature to recover a cluster of strange organs from the remains. This cluster functions as a decanter of endless water for 2d6 hours, but can only produce a "stream" or "fountain" effect. Failing this Survival check by 5 or more causes the cluster to burst, dealing an additional 2d6 points of damage to that creature (no save) and destroying the organs entirely. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Muddy Field (Su) As a standard action when on sand, soil, or other types of loose earth, a grodair can gush standing water into the area surrounding it. Upon doing so, the land within 15 feet of the  grodair is treated as a shallow bog (Core Rulebook 427). This water remains as long as the grodair is within 15 feet and wishes to maintain the water. The bog instantly disperses as soon as the grodair is killed or moves out of the area.  Water Blast (Ex) The grodair's ranged attack is a pressurized blast of water. This attack has a range of 60 feet with no range increment.

This allows the hellstoker to fire a jet of flame from its bellows in a line to a range of 30 feet, once per round as a standard action. It must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit a foe. A creature hit by the fire takes 1d8 points of fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch on fire.  Fiery Body (Ex) The oil coating a hellstoker's body is highly flammable. As such, a hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into flames. This deals no damage to the hellstoker, and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds before extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide; therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (see oily hide below), and it can be caught on fire again.  Oily Hide (Ex) Hellstokers do not secrete oil naturally, but their constant contact with it leaves them coated with a thick layer of the substance at all times. This grants hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (included in the statistics block). The oil cannot be washed off or removed.  Additionally, if a hellstoker is hit with a fire effect, it bursts into flames. See the hellstoker's fiery body above for details.

The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.

Creatures hitting an acid quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack. Acid Swimmer (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic nature of their environment on their home plane. Drench (Ex) The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals the quasi-elemental's HD). Fumes (Ex) The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body act as an inhaled poison. Creatures within 5 ft. of an acid quasi-elemental must make succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage each round. This poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves more than 5 ft. away from the acid quasi-elemental. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by water. An acid quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasi-elemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental.

A creature caught in the area can make a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics for each elemental's death throes. Molten Glass (Ex) A successful hit against an obsidian quasi-elemental with a piercing or slashing weapon (or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage equal to its current HD opens a wound that spurts molten glass. The wound bleeds for 1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a Reflex save or take fire damage from the splash. A new save must be made each round the wound bleeds and a creature is within the area. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.

Phasing (Su) A hypnalis can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action and shift back again as a move action (or part of a move action). The ability is otherwise identical to ethereal jaunt (CL 15th).  Poison (Su) If a hypnalis poisons an ethereal creature while on the Ethereal Plane (including creatures under the effects of spells or effects that grant etherealness such as ethereal jaunt), the creature is immediately forced onto the Material Plane and takes the specified Constitution damage. Creatures on the Material Plane are affected by this poison as normal.

Creatures attacking an ice golem with unarmed strikes or natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits. Icy Destruction (Ex) When reduced to 0 hit points, an ice golem shatters in an explosion of jagged shards of ice. All creatures within a 10-foot burst take 3d6 points of slashing damage and 2d6 points of cold damage; a DC 13 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Immunity to Magic (Ex) An ice golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that have the Fire descriptor, which affect it normally. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an ice golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. • A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. An ice golem gets no saving throw against cold effects.

Spells A lampad casts spells as a 5th-level druid, but can't swap out prepared spells to cast summon spells.  Weep (Su) As a standard action, a lampad can unsettle those near her when she cries.

This is a mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Lamprey Swarm	5.00	1600	Tiny	6	14, touch 14, flat-footed 12	52	8	10	5	swarm traits			5 ft., swim 30 ft.	swarm (2d6 plus distraction and blood drain)		10 ft.	0 ft.	distraction (DC 16)	Str 5, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2	6	-	-	Tome of Horrors 4	Blood Drain (Ex) Any living creature that takes damage from a lamprey swarm must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save. On a failed save, several lampreys have attached themselves to the target and the creature takes 1d3 points of Constitution damage each round as the lampreys drain blood. This effect continues as long as the victim remains in the swarm and for 1d6 rounds after it leaves the swarm. The attached lampreys can be killed instantly by dealing at least 6 points of damage to the victim (any weapon or energy-based attacks work), ending the effect prematurely. A successful DC 16 Heal check reduces the duration by 1d6 rounds, ending the effect prematurely. The save DC and check DC are both Constitution-based.																												
Lar	5.00	1600	Medium	3	17, touch 17, flat-footed 14	39	3	7	4				0 ft., fly 30 ft. (perfect)			2-1/2 ft.	0 ft.	suggestion	Str 10, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 14	6	6	19	AP 27	Genius Loci (Su) As a free action, a lar can possess any inanimate object with which it comes into contact, thereby animating it under its control. The object and lar merge, taking on the statistics of an animated object of the same size (see animated objects in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). A lar may possess any object of Tiny to Large size. If the animated object is destroyed or targeted by dispel good, the lar is expelled and takes 1d6 points of damage per size category of the possessed object-1d6 for a Tiny object, 2d6 for a Small object, and so on. The lar is then free to possess another object, if one is available. If a lar is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it is banished to its statua for 24 hours, after which it is fully healed. If the lar does not have a statua, or the statua is destroyed while it is at 0 or fewer hit points, the lar is killed. Natural Invisibility (Su) This ability is constant, allowing a lar to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the invisibility purge spell. Statua (Su) All lares rely on a small stone figure, known as a statua, for survival. This figurine serves as a lar's home, resting place, and tie to the Material Plane. Lares typically rest within their statua, finding it a comfortable place from which to oversee their surroundings. For every round a lar spends doing nothing besides resting within its statua, it regenerates 1 point of damage. However, being separated from the statua for extended periods of time weakens the lar. For every 5 hours a lar remains outside of its statua, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Only returning to the statua can heal this damage. If a lar falls to 0 hit points, even from nonlethal damage, it is banished back to the Upper Planes. While a lar's statua exists, the connected lar is treated as a native outsider. Any attempt to banish the lar-through dismissal or a similar spell-merely transports the creature back to its statua. If the statua is destroyed, a lar can be dismissed from the Material Plane as normal. Suggestion (Sp) A lar can influence creatures as per the spell suggestion, with some variations, at will. First, to influence a creature in this manner, a lar must occupy the same square as its target. The lar is considered to be able to speak any language and communicate with any creature-even animals and vermin (which are usually immune to mind-affecting effects)-for the purposes of this effect. The target may attempt to resist a lar's suggestion by making a DC 17 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Earth Mastery (Ex) An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)

Large Gravity Elemental	5.00	1600	Large	10	18, touch 18, flat-footed 11	76	6	12	6	distortion			fly 100 ft. (perfect)	2 slams +13 (1d6+3)	missile +13) (damage by type)	10 ft.	10 ft.	engulf, gravity field (crush 4/day, 20 ft. radius, DC 17, 2d8 bludgeoning)	Str 16, Dex 23, Con 18, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	8	12	31	Tome of Horrors Complete	Distortion (Su) The manipulation of light waves around a gravity elemental grants it a +2 deflection bonus to its Armor Class. Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds.																												
Large Ice Elemental	5.00	1600	Large	5	17, touch 10, flat-footed 16	68	9	7	2			vulnerable to fire	20 ft., burrow (ice and snow only) 20 ft., swim 60 ft.	2 slams +12 (1d8+5 plus 1d6 cold)		10 ft.	10 ft.	numbing cold (DC 17)	Str 20, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	8	14	25 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Ice Glide (Su) A burrowing ice elemental can pass through nonmagical ice and snow as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A control water spell cast on an area containing a burrowing ice elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the elemental climbs must be icy. The elemental can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Numbing Cold (Su) When an ice elemental deals cold damage to a creature, that creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is listed in the elemental's stat block and is Constitution-based. Snow Vision (Ex) An ice elemental can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

Spark Leap (Ex) A lightning elemental gains a +10 bonus on bull rush, disarm, overrun, and trip attacks when it charges a creature against whom its metal mastery ability applies.																												
Large Magma Elemental	5.00	1600	Large	3	16, touch 8, flat-footed 16	60	8	5	2			vulnerable to cold	20 ft., burrow 20 ft.	2 slams +11 (1d8+4 plus burn)		10 ft.	10 ft.	burn (1d6, DC 14), lava puddle	Str 18, Dex 8, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	8	13	22	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Burn (Ex) A magma elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn quite as hot as true elemental flames. Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Lava Puddle (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a puddle of lava (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) that fills its space to a depth of 2-3 inches and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round. The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after a number of rounds equal to the elemental's Hit Dice. At the GM's discretion, this puddle of lava could start secondary fires.																												
Large Mud Elemental	5.00	1600	Large	1	17, touch 10, flat-footed 16	68	9	7	2				20 ft., burrow 10 ft., swim 30 ft.	2 slams +12 (1d8+5 plus entrap)		10 ft.	10 ft.	entrap (DC 17, 10 minutes, hardness 5, hp 10)	Str 20, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11	8	14	25	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing mud elemental can pass through dirt, gravel, or other loose or porous solid matter as easily as a fish swims through water. It cannot use this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Entrap (Ex) The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3 rounds of immersion in water.																												
Large Smoke Elemental	5.00	1600	Large	10	19, touch 15, flat-footed 13	60	8	12	2	air mastery, amorphous		vulnerability to cold, vulnerability to wind	fly 80 ft. (perfect)	2 slams +13 (1d8+3 plus burn)		10 ft.	10 ft.	burn (1d6, DC 15), engulf (DC 17)	Str 16, Dex 23, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	8	12	28 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Air Mastery (Ex) Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a smoke elemental.  Burn (Ex) A smoke elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn as hot as a true fire elemental's flames.  Engulf (Ex) A smoke elemental can engulf creatures of its size or smaller into its smoky form as part of a standard action. It cannot make any other attack in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that are not adjacent to them.  Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Gaseous (Ex) A smoke elemental can pass through small holes or narrow openings without reducing its speed.  Vulnerability to Wind (Ex) A smoke elemental is treated as two sizes smaller for purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.

The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental's HD). Vortex (Su) A water elemental can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (see page 306), but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water. Water Mastery (Ex) A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.																												
Leucrotta	5.00	1600	Large	5	18, touch 10, flat-footed 17	57	9	6	4				60 ft., climb 30 ft.	bite +10 (2d6+7/19-20), 2 hooves +5 (1d6+2)		10 ft.	5 ft.	lure, powerful bite	Str 21, Dex 12, Con 18, Int 11, Wis 14, Cha 17	6	12	23 (27 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Lure (Su) At any point that a leucrotta's targets are unaware of it (for example, if the leucrotta is hiding or concealed in darkness), the leucrotta can call out to the targets, who must be in line of sight and within 60 feet. When the leucrotta calls out, the targets must make a DC 16 Will save or fall under the effects of a suggestion to approach the sound of the leucrotta's voice. This effect functions identically to a mass suggestion spell with a caster level equal to the leucrotta's Hit Dice. A creature that saves cannot be affected again by the same leucrotta's lure for 24 hours. The lure is a language-dependant effect, and if the leucrotta uses the victim's name during the lure, the victim takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Powerful Bite (Ex) A leucrotta's bite attack always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. When a leucrotta bites an object, its bite treats the object as having a hardness of 5 less than the object's actual hardness rating.

Lurker In Light	5.00	1600	Small	8	18, touch 15, flat-footed 14	44	4	10	9	blend with light			30 ft., fly 30 ft.

As with greater invisibility, they may attack and still remain invisible. In shadowy illumination, a lurker loses this invisibility, though like all creatures in shadows, they have concealment unless the viewer has darkvision. If the lurker is flying, its fluttering wings partially negate this effect, giving it only partial concealment (20%) rather than total concealment.  Daylight Door (Sp) Once per day, a lurker can use dimension door, transporting only itself and up to 50 pounds of material. The start and end points of the teleport must be in areas of bright light; if the destination lacks sufficient light, the teleport fails but does not expend the ability for the day.  Poison (Ex) Lurkers typically coat their daggers with shadow essence poison.  Shadow essence poison: Injury; save Fortitude DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; initial effect 1 Str drain; secondary effect 1d3 Str damage; cure 1 save.  Ritual Gate (Su) By sacrificing one or more humanoid victims, a lurker or group of lurkers can create a gate to the Material Plane, one of the Elemental Planes, or the realm of the fey, either to return home or to conjure allies. Creating a gate for travel requires the sacrifice of five victims-the gate created remains open for 1 minute. Creating a gate to bring allies to the Material Plane requires one sacrifice for every HD of the creature intended to pass through the gate (so five sacrifices can bring a lurker or a Medium air elemental, eight can bring a Large earth elemental, and so on). The sacrifices do not need to be simultaneous; as long all sacrifices occur at some point during the hour-long ritual, the magic continues to build until it reaches the required total.																												
Magnesium Spirit	5.00	1600	Medium	6	14, touch 14, flat-footed 12	45	8	5	7		18	vulnerability to holy water	50 ft.	incorporeal tail slap +8 (1d6 plus 1d6 Str damage)		5 ft.	5 ft.	blinding flash, energy drain, soul portal	Str -, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 15	6	8	20 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Energy Drain (Su) A magnesium spirit possessing a host deals 1 negative level to it each round if the host fails a DC 16 Will save. A magnesium spirit gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level bestowed. The save DC is Constitutionbased. Negative levels remain for 24 hours, after which time the host can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to remove a negative level. Soul Portal (Su) This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 8th), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the magnesium spirit must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 17 Will save. If the save fails, the magnesium spirit vanishes into the target's body. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the creature's Ability Focus feat. A magnesium spirit that has possessed an opponent's body deals a negative level to the host each round (see its energy drain attack above). When the host drops below 1st level, both it and the magnesium spirit vanish in a flash of white light as the spirit completes the ritual needed to return it to its plane of origin. Neither is ever seen again. Each round, as a standard action, while the magnesium spirit inhabits its body, the host can attempt to eject the creature by making an opposed Wisdom check against the magnesium spirit's Wisdom check. If successful, the magnesium spirit is ejected and cannot use its soul portal ability against that creature again for 1 hour. A magnesium spirit can be damaged by holy water even while merged with its host. Holy water deals 2d4 points of damage per vial to the creature. If it takes half or more of its current hit points in damage from holy water, it is ejected from the host's body. The host is stunned for 1d3 rounds. Strength Damage (Su) A magnesium spirit's incorporeal tail slap deals 1d6 points of Strength damage to a living foe. When a foe has taken a total of Strength damage equal to one-half its original Strength total, the magnesium spirit can use its soul portal attack against that opponent. Vulnerability to Holy Water (Ex) A magnesium spirit takes 2d4 points of damage from holy water (even while merged with a host).

This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only 24 spikes in any 24-hour period.

The mercane does not need an expensive replica chest to use this ability; any chest will do. It can only use this ability on one chest at a time.																												
Mirror Man	5.00	1600	Medium	6	18, touch 17, flat-footed 11	53	2	8	4			susceptible to mind-affecting effects	30 ft.	#ERROR!	dagger +12/+7 (1d4+3/19-20)	5 ft.	5 ft.	sneak attack +2d6	Str 16, Dex 23, Con -, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 12	6	9	26	AP 68	Alert Master (Su) Three times per day, a mirror man can send a brief message to a creature it is familiar with (typically its master). This effect is similar to the sending spell, but it takes only a standard action, the communication is one way, and the target cannot respond to the sending.  Mirror Sight (Ex) A mirror man has no eyes, but is capable of visually perceiving through the use of blindsight, darkvision, and low-light vision.  Scrying Focus (Su) Mirror men are specifically created to interact with the spell Irriseni mirror sight (Pathfinder Adventure Path #67 73) in special ways. The construct's mirrored face can serve as a known mirror, allowing the caster to see from the perspective of the construct's face with normal sight. The caster may also communicate telepathically with the mirror man. As a swift action, the mirror man can choose to remember and record up to 1 minute of what it sees. This memory is visual only and can be viewed remotely through Irriseni mirror sight or played back across its face. The mirror man can only retain 1 minute of images; when its memory is full, old memories are erased so it can remember new ones. The caster may interact with the mirror man's soul mirror even after the construct body is destroyed as long as the face itself remains unbroken. If the construct has not been destroyed, an opponent must succeed at a sunder attempt targeting the mirrored face to break the mirror. The mirrored face is considered a separate weapon with a hardness of 1 and hit points equal to the mirror man's Hit Dice. If the construct has been destroyed, the mirrored face can be smashed as a standard action.  Soul Mirror (Su) The soul of a mirror man is bound within its mirrored face. As long as the face remains intact, it can be affixed to a new construct body using the same cost to create a new construct. Once a soul is bound to a mirror, the soul continues to learn, and if the mirror is later affixed to a new body, the soul retains any memories from its previous bodies.  Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) The self-aware and autonomous nature of a mirror man makes it susceptible to mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that it is a construct.																												
Mist Drake	5.00	1600	Large	2	19, touch 12, flat-footed 16	57	8	7	6				30 ft., fly 80 ft.

This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 16 half). A flying creatures that fails its Reflex save is pushed 1d4 x 5 feet from the center of the fogburst's area of effect (taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet if it strikes a solid object), while creatures on the ground are knocked prone on a failed save. The area of effect of the fogburst is filled with mist (as obscuring mist) for 1d4 rounds after impact. Once a mist drake has used its fogburst attack, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Fogvision (Ex) A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist, fog, or precipitation.  Misty Camouflage (Ex) A mist drake can use Stealth to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an area of mist, even while being observed.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to take an additional move action in that round.

Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same mummy's despair ability for 24 hours. This is a paralysis and a mind-affecting fear affect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Mummy Rot (Su) Curse and disease-slam; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure -. Mummy rot is both a curse and disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element of mummy rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted creature must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from mummy rot turns to dust and cannot be raised without a resurrection or greater magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Use the statistics for the undead raven swarm found elsewhere in this book. These smaller crows continue to relentlessly attack all living creatures within sight.  Eye Rake (Ex) If a murder crow hits an opponent with both claws in the same round, the victim must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or be blinded as the crow scratches and tears at the victim's eyes. The blindness last for 1d4 days while the eyes naturally heal, or until healed (with remove blindness or a successful DC 15 Heal check). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

A gargoyle that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.  Opportunistic Movement (Ex) A mythic gargoyle can rapidly move to take advantage of an opponent's weakened defenses. When an opponent within 30 feet takes an action that provokes an attack of opportunity, as an immediate action the mythic gargoyle can expend one use of mythic power to move up to 40 feet, ending its movement next to the creature that provoked the attack of opportunity and making an attack of opportunity against that creature. The gargoyle's movement from this ability doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.  Possess Statue (Su) A mythic gargoyle can expend one use of mythic power to possess and animate a Medium stone statue within 100 feet. The possessed statue functions as a non-mythic gargoyle and lasts as long as the statue is in range and the gargoyle concentrates. When using this ability, the gargoyle's actual body is immobile (as if using its freeze ability) and helpless. It can stop using this ability as a move action. If the statue is destroyed, the gargoyle's life force returns to its own body.

Str 19, Dex 14, Con 17, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 13	5	9	21	Tome of Horrors 4	Adhesive (Ex) A neomimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered neomimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the neomimic is alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated neomimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive, but the neomimic can still grapple normally. A neomimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is Strength-based.  Alter Physique (Ex) At will as a standard action, a neomimic can alter its physical structure to affect its physique. A neomimic can shift points between its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution by reducing one or more of the scores while raising one or more by the same amount. The neomimic can shift no more than 12 points at one time and no score can be raised or lowered by more than 10 points. For example, a neomimic can reduce its Strength from 19 to 10 while increasing its Dexterity from 14 to 18. It could not, however, decrease its Strength to less than 9, or increase its Dexterity to greater than 24. These changes remain in effect until the neomimic uses this ability again.

Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or become sickened until 1d6 minutes after leaving the area. This smoke acts as obscuring mist for the purposes of concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round.  The save DC is Constitution-based.

The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals the niln's HD).  Vapor Form (Su) The niln spends the majority of its time in more or less solid form, but it can assume vapor form at will.  It can switch forms once per round as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in vapor form. A niln in vapor form can fly at 60 feet per round (perfect). This ability is otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell (caster level 5th).

Split (Ex) Slashing weapons, piercing weapons, and electricity attacks deal no damage to an ochre jelly. Instead the creature splits into two identical jellies, each with half of the original creature's current hit point total, rounded down.  A jelly with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.

All creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be shaken as long as they remain within the area and for 2d4 rounds afterward. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the bellow of that onyx deer for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Onyx deer are immune to their own bellow and that of other onyx deer.  Onyx Bite (Su) An onyx deer's bite deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage against a living creature if it fails a DC 18 Fortitude save. A living creature reduced to Constitution 3 or less transforms into onyx, resembling nothing more than a statue. A stone to flesh spell returns a transformed creature to its original form, though if it was reduced to Constitution 0 by the onyx deer's bite it immediately dies upon returning to its natural form.

While in this state, an oronci cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill checks, but functions as if under the effects of a haste spell. The oronci can continue to frenzy for up to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Spit (Ex) An oronci can spit poison at a target within 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack, and can only be performed once every 1d6 rounds. If the attack is successful, the target is affected by the poison just as if it had been injured. The oronci can still poison a target with each successful bite attack.  Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although an oronci is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid. As a result, oronci wield weapons as if they were one size category smaller than their actual size (Medium for most oronci).																												
Ostiarius	5.00	1600	Medium	6	18, touch 12, flat-footed 16	52	7	4	11				30 ft.	2 touches +2 (1 plus bleed)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (1d6), compel courage, unnerving gaze (30 ft., DC 19)	Str 10, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 19, Wis 18, Cha 19	7	7	19	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Compel Courage (Ex) An ostiarius can inspire courage as a 5th-level bard using bardic performance, granting a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +2 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. This ability has a range of 50 feet and affects those creatures the ostiarius chooses who also willingly accept the benefits of the effect (no saving throw required). The ostiarius's performance compels creatures to perform at dangerous extremes. Any living non-outsider that benefits from this ability takes 1 point of bleed damage. A creature that accepts these benefits for multiple consecutive rounds gains additional points of bleed damage that stack with one another (to a maximum of 5). This is an audible, mind-affecting effect and can be countered by a bard's countersong class feature.  Shadow Traveler (Ex) When an ostiarius uses plane shift to travel to the Plane of Shadow, it arrives at its intended destination with complete accuracy. When an ostiarius uses shadow walk, it moves at 100 miles per hour.  Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an ostiarius's unnerving gaze becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Using a hex is a standard action (unless otherwise noted) that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Save DCs are Intelligence-based.  Cackle Hex (Su) As a move action, the penanggalen may cackle. Any creature within 30 feet that is under the effects of the penanggalen's evil eye or misfortune hex has the duration of that hex extended by 1 round.  Evil Eye Hex (Su) This hex causes the target creature to take a -2 penalty on one of the following (penanggalen's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This effect lasts for 6 rounds, or only 1 round if the target succeeds at a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect.  Misfortune Hex (Su) This hex causes a creature to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Whenever the target makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check during this time, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A DC 15 Will save negates this effect. A creature may only be targeted by this hex once per day.

Ethereal Jaunt (Su) A phase spider can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or as part of a move action). The ability is otherwise identical to ethereal jaunt (CL 15th).  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 8 rounds; effect 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Str 16, Dex 18, Con 19, Int 15, Wis 9, Cha 8	4	6	20	AP 63	Disease (Ex) Pulsing Puffs: Puffball-injury; save Fort DC 18; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Pulsing puffs is a disease characterized by small, blue-white spores sprouting within a creature's wounds. These spores quickly grow into phosphorescent, domed mounds that pulsate and throb, eating away at victims' connective tissue, severely impairing them. Additionally, once a creature takes 7 points of Dexterity damage from the pulsing puffs, the domed mounds burst, releasing a 10-foot-radius burst of diseased spores. This effect lasts for 1 round. Any creature caught within the burst radius or that moves through it is exposed to the pulsing puffs disease. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Fungal Alchemy (Ex) As long as he has access to his fungus garden, a polevik can craft any alchemical item with a Craft DC of 25 or lower without needing to pay a cost in gold pieces for raw materials. Items function normally but may have a different appearance. For example, materials usually stored in glass jars instead fill rigid spheres of plant matter.  Puffballs (Ex) Poleviks have learned how to nurture myriad species of symbiotic fungi upon their bodies, and the most treasured of these are their deadly puffballs. Each 6-inch-diameter spherical fungus has a thorny internal stalk covered by a thin skin of spore-laden flesh. As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, a polevik can pluck and throw a puffball with a range of 20 feet. On a successful hit, the thorns expand and pulsate on impact, bursting through the flesh of the puffball. This inflicts vicious wounds and releases fungal spores that infect the victim with pulsing puffs. As soon as a puffball has been plucked, another grows in its place. Once a puffball has been plucked, it decomposes after 1 round, becoming inert.  Putrefying Aura (Su) All unattended nonmagical food or liquid within the radius of a polevik's aura instantly rots or spoils. Attended nonmagical food or liquid within the aura receives a saving throw to resist this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Even in these forms, however, it typically has pale coloration and lightninglike patterns.  Electric Body (Su) As an immediate action, a raiju can transform itself into a ball of living lightning. While in this form, the raiju gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal quality. It only takes half damage from corporeal sources if they are magical (it takes no damage from nonmagical weapons and objects). Additionally, it sparks with electricity while it is in this form. Any creature that touches the raiju with a natural or unarmed attack or whose square the raiju passes through during its movement must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based. In normal weather, a raiju can remain incorporeal for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice, though it can remain incorporeal for as long as it pleases during a thunderstorm.  Shocking Burst (Su) Besides dealing normal slashing damage, the claw and tail of a raiju are considered to have the shocking burst weapon special quality. They deal 1d6 extra points of electrical damage on a normal hit and an additional 1d10 points on a critical hit.

It can use Diplomacy to alter a rat's attitude, and when so doing gains a +4 racial bonus on the check. Any ability that allows a creature to communicate with rats (such as speak with animals or a wererat's rat empathy) allows for communication with a rat king.

Because the rope golem seizes the opponent by the neck, a strangled foe cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A rope golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A disintegrate spell affects it normally. A rope trick or animate rope spell deals 1d6 points of damage to the rope golem per three levels of the spell caster (e.g., a 6th-level sorcerer deals 2d6 points of damage to a rope golem if it casts rope trick or animate rope). A mending spell heals the rope golem of 2d6 points of damage. Fire-based effects and spells affect it as described in its fire vulnerability above.

The sabosan prefer to drain helpless foes. Dread Flight (Ex) A sabosan can use its Hover feat to create a dust cloud as if it were a Large creature, except the dust cloud only has a 30-foot radius. Fell Shriek (Ex) As a standard action, a sabosan can emit a deafening cry in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in this area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The sabosan are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This effect creates a 15-foot-cone burst of needles that deals 4d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures in the area (Reflex DC 20 for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Needle Hide (Ex) A saguaroi is covered with needles and spines, and its slam attacks deal both bludgeoning and piercing damage. Any creature grappling a saguaroi or attacking it with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d4 points of piercing damage (manufactured weapons with the reach special feature do not endanger the user this way). A creature grappling a saguaroi takes this damage each round of the grapple.  Produce Water (Ex) As a standard action once per hour, a saguaroi can cut itself (taking 1 point of damage) to produce 1 gallon of water. After producing 4 gallons, it becomes fatigued.

As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The crocodile deals its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the crocodile maintains its grapple.  Hold Breath (Ex) A saltwater crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.  Lunging Bite (Ex) Once per minute, a saltwater crocodile can extend the reach of its bite attack by 5 feet without taking the normal penalties to AC associated with the Lunge feat. This extended reach applies only to the crocodile's bite attack and lasts until the start of the creature's next turn.

This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same mastiff's bay for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Shadow Blend (Su) In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow mastiff disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (50% miss chance). Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not negate this ability; a daylight spell, however, does. A shadow mastiff can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.

Levels in the bard class stack with this ability.  Siren Song (Su) When a siren sings, all non-sirens within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become enthralled (see below). The effect depends on the type of song the siren chooses, and continues for as long as the siren sings and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by any of that siren's songs for 1 hour. These are sonic, mind-affecting effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. Enthralled creatures behave in one of the following four ways, which the siren chooses when she begins singing.  • Captivation: This functions exactly like a harpy's captivating song (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 172).  • Fascination: Affected creatures are fascinated.  • Obsession: An obsessed victim becomes defensive of the siren and does all he can to prevent harm from coming to her, going so far as attacking his allies in her defense.  The victim is not controlled by the siren, but views her as a cherished ally. This is a charm effect.  • Slumber: The victim immediately falls asleep, rendering the creature helpless. While the siren is singing, no noise will wake the sleeping creature, though slapping or wounding him does. The creature continues sleeping for 1d4 minutes after the siren stops singing, but can be awakened by loud noises or any other normal method.

Screech (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a skaveling can screech as a mobat, save that those who are affected are stunned for 1d3 rounds unless they make a DC 16 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Rage (Ex) A skin stitcher that takes damage in combat has a 50% chance of flying into a berserk rage the following round, attacking its foe until either it or its opponent is dead.  It gains +4 Strength and -4 AC while raging. The skin stitcher cannot end its rage voluntarily. Note that the skin stitcher does not drop its chains while raging.  Skin Scent (Ex) The skin stitcher can detect any living creature that possesses natural skin to a distance of one-half mile. This includes all creature types, in most cases, except plants, elementals, oozes, constructs, vermin, and many undead (undead with flesh, such as zombies, can be detected by a skin stitcher, but skeletons cannot).

Any swarm that shares a space with a skinstitch gains fast healing equal to the swarm's Hit Dice.  Repair (Ex) A skinstitch can repair itself by sewing additional fabric, leather, or hide to its body. Doing so requires at least 1 square foot of material and a full-round action, which restores 1 hit point to the skinstitch.

Implanting an egg in a host is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and the target must be helpless but alive. Once an egg is implanted, it exudes paralytic enzymes that not only keep the victim in state of perpetual paralysis, but also keep it nourished and alive in its comatose but fully aware state. This condition lasts until the egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, at which point the young spider eater consumes most of its host, killing it. An egg can be surgically removed with a DC 25 Heal check (this check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host regardless of success), at which point the host recovers from the paralysis in 1d6 rounds. Any magical effect that removes paralysis or disease (such as remove paralysis, remove disease, or heal) also destroys the egg, but mere immunity to paralysis or disease does not offer protection.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect paralysis for 1 minute; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Creatures within 10 feet of a sprite swarm with line of sight must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is dazzled for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Concentrated Rush (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, if more than one creature occupies a sprite swarm's space, the swarm may use its attack action to concentrate on one of these creatures to deal 4d6 points of damage in place of its normal swarm damage. Other creatures within the horde's space do not take swarm damage that round.  Mob Mentality (Ex) As long as a sprite swarm has at least 10 hit points, it retains its Intelligence score and can act accordingly. Even so, it cannot be targeted by mind-affecting spells or effects that target a single creature. If its hit points fall below 10, the swarm is considered mindless as the individual creatures within begin to panic.

The dinosaur makes these attacks with its horned crest, but they are treated as normal gore attacks.

Frightening Exuviation (Ex) If a tazelwurm is hit by a fire attack or effect that deals at least 10 points of damage, it takes no damage, but instead allows its scales, flesh, and fur to be consumed and burned away in a single round, exposing its skeletal structure. A creature viewing this must make a successful DC 15 Will save or paralyzed with fear for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same tazelwurm's frightening exuviation for one day. This has no effect on other tazelwurms.

Creatures affected by this aura stop functioning as allies to other creatures. An affected creature can't provide flanking, can't serve as an ally for teamwork feats or aid another actions, and doesn't allow its allies to move through its space. Any spell or effect that requires a willing target fails if it is used on an affected creature, and even harmless effects require an attack roll (if applicable) and require the insolent creature to attempt a saving throw against them. An affected creature remains insolent as long as it is adjacent to a thoxel demon and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same thoxel's aura for 24 hours. Thoxel demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Betrayer's Blade (Su) If a thoxel demon hits a creature with both ends of its two-bladed sword in the same round, the target is compelled to attack its leader. The target can negate this effect with a successful DC 15 Will save. A creature affected by this effect turns on its leader or commander and attacks as if it were dominated for 1d6 rounds. An animal companion, cohort, or familiar must attack its master, and a called, charmed, dominated, or summoned creature must attack the creature controlling it. If a creature has no leader, it instead attacks a random ally. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Disrupt Coordination (Su) Whenever a creature threatened by a thoxel demon uses the aid another action, the thoxel can, as an immediate action, attempt to interrupt and negate that action. The thoxel demon must make an attack roll. The attack roll of the creature performing the aid another action must equal or exceed the thoxel demon's attack roll; otherwise, the aid another action is negated.

While compressing itself against the floor of a body of water, a tizheruk gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks.  See-Through Skin (Ex) Because so much of a tizheruk's body is transparent, a creature swallowed whole by it has line of sight to creatures outside the creature, and creatures outside the tizheruk can see anyone inside.  Tongue (Ex) A tizheruk's tongue is a primary attack with a reach equal to double the tizheruk's normal reach (20 feet for a Large tizheruk). A tizheruk's tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can be used to grab a creature and pull it closer. A tizheruk doesn't gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.

The ink provides total concealment in water, and persists for 1 minute. If used out of the water, the jet of ink is a line 30 feet long, and creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Toy Golem	5.00	1600	Medium	3	21, touch 11, flat-footed 19	53	2	3	6			vulnerable to electricity	30 ft.	2 slams +10 (1d6+4 plus disease)		5 ft.	5 ft.	disease	Str 18, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	6	5	17	Tombs Of Golarion	Clockwork Repair (Ex) The toy golem has fast healing 2 when in an area with a high concentration of clockwork parts, such as Mutalib's workshop or the area created by a similar golem's discorporate ability.  Disease (Ex) Tetanus: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1d6 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Dex damage. Each time a victim takes Dexterity damage from tetanus, there's a 50% chance its jaw muscles stiffen, preventing speech and the use of spells with verbal components for 24 hours; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Transposer	5.00	1600	Medium	1	14, touch 12, flat-footed 12	33	3	3	10	transposition			30 ft.	2 slams +5 (1d6+1 plus transposition)		5 ft.	5 ft.	transposition	Str 12, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 12	4	21	32 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Blending Disguise (Ex) When using its disguise self spell-like ability, the transposer can make itself look like a creature of the humanoid or monstrous humanoid type. When disguising itself, the transposer ignores the usual penalty for different race, age category, and gender. Finally, transposers gain a racial bonus equal to one half their racial Hit Dice to the Will save DC to penetrate the illusion of their disguise self ability. Transposition (Su) An opponent hit by a transposer's slam attack becomes linked (transposed) to it by an invisible and undetectable field of energy for 1 hour if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. A transposer can have a number of opponents equal to its HD linked to it at one time. An opponent can be linked to more than one transposer (if it fails its save against each transposer's attack). The save DC is Constitution-based. When a linked opponent attacks a transposer it is linked to, the creature gains hit points equal to the damage the attack would normally deal, and the attacker takes the damage. Other opponents linked to that transposer are unharmed. A transposer can gain up to the maximum hit points allowed by its Hit Dice. It cannot gain bonus or temporary hit points from this ability. Curative magic cast on a transposer by a transposed opponent damages the creature by the amount it would normally heal, and heals a like amount of damage on the one who cast the spell. (Other linked creatures are unaffected.) Curative magic cast on a transposed opponent works normally but does not heal or harm a linked transposer. Curative magic cast on a transposer by a non-linked opponent functions normally. Opponents not linked to the transposer can attack and affect the creature normally.

Str -, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 15, Wis 13, Cha 15	6	8	20 (can't be tripped)	Inner Sea Bestiary	Planebound (Ex) An umbral shepherd is inherently tied to the Plane of Shadow, and can't survive for long on any other plane without a host body. Each round that an umbral shepherd is on another plane without a host body, it takes 1d6 points of damage.  Possession (Su) An umbral shepherd can possess a host body as if using magic jar, save that if its host body is killed while possessed, the shepherd dies as well. An umbral shepherd can attempt a possession anytime it succeeds at a touch attack, even while already in a host body. If the touched creature fails a DC 15 Will save, it becomes possessed. Possession by an umbral shepherd takes a toll on its host body, which takes 1 point of Constitution drain every month it is so possessed. Abandoning a host body requires the umbral shepherd to either take a standard action (to appear in a square adjacent to the host) or make a successful possession attempt on a new host. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shadow Touch (Su) An umbral shepherd that succeeds at a touch attack can attempt to dissolve a portion of the victim's flesh into shadow, which then dissipates, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Victims that succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save take half damage. The umbral shepherd can use this ability even while possessing a host body. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Targets within 10 feet of the origin of this cone must succeed at a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked prone. Those who succeed at the check or are standing farther away from the ved treat the effects of the gale breath as a gust of wind spell.

Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor swarm or inside it must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same vescavor swarm's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Ravenous (Ex) Vescavors can devour nearly anything, with the exception of adamantine. If the swarm attacks an object or structure, the vescavors ignore its hardness if it is made of any substance other than adamantine. Additionally, every round that a creature is in the same space as the swarm, the vescavors begin devouring one object on the creature. The object takes half its maximum hit points in damage and gains the broken condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the broken condition, it is destroyed. An attended or magic object can make a DC 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Traumatizing (Su) Vescavors embody the meanest depravities of the Outer Rifts, and walking among them is akin to being trapped in the Abyss itself. Any creature that spends more than 3 rounds inside a vescavor swarm must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or gain one of the types of madness presented on page 250 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide. Roll on the Types of Insanity table to determine which type of insanity affects the creature-the creature does not make another Will save against the specific insanity. This affliction is permanent, but can be healed as detailed in the Curing Insanity section of the Sanity and Madness rules. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A vodyanoi can control narrow currents of breathable water to provide oxygen to up to 3 other creatures in the area of effect-vodyanois themselves are immune to this effect. All other creatures in an area of suffocating water must hold their breath or risk suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating water does not move-it persists for a number of minutes equal to the vodyanoi's Hit Dice. The slimy water does not impact swim speeds or visibility in any significant manner. A creature can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the difference between suffocating water and any normal water that may surround it.

Str 18, Dex 19, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 11	7	12	26	Tome of Horrors Complete	Detect Thoughts (Sp) For every wind walker present within 100 feet, the range of this spell-like ability increases by 100 feet.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A wind walker is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance (except those that summon or call it). In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  A control weather spell instantly slays a wind walker if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell.  A haste spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to a wind walker. A Fortitude save halves the damage. In addition, a haste spell increases the damage the wind walker deals with its wind blast attack by +1d6 for one round.  An ice storm spell deals no damage to a wind walker, but is affected as if by a fear spell if it fails a Will saving throw against ice storm.  A slow spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a wind walker. A Will save halves the damage.  A summoned or called wind walker is affected normally by magical barriers that restrict or inhibit called or summoned creatures (such as antimagic field).  Wind Blast (Ex) A wind walker attacks using the air surrounding it, transforming it into a forceful blast that deals 2d6+6 points of damage to all creatures within reach. The wind walker makes a single attack roll at its full attack bonus against each opponent within reach as a standard action.

These spawn are less powerful than typical wraiths, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive -2 hp per HD, and only drain 1d2 points of Constitution on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that created them until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become free-willed wraiths. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Constitution Drain (Su) Creatures hit by a wraith's touch attack must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. On each successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based. Lifesense (Su) A wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) A wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered. Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a wraith, unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.

Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.																												
Yamabushi Tengu	5.00	1600	Medium	8	18, touch 14, flat-footed 14	57	9	9	4		16	susceptible to patterns	30 ft., fly 30 ft.

Yamabushi tengus who do not use swords favor the kusarigama.  Steal Voice (Su) Up to three times per day, but no more than once per target, a yamabushi tengu can attempt to steal a victim's voice as part of its bite attack. When it does so, the creature bitten must make a DC 16 Will save or lose the ability to speak aloud. This prevents the use of any spell with verbal components and the use of command-word-activated magic items, among other difficulties. The yamabushi tengu's voice changes to match the one stolen. The victim's voice remains stolen until the oni steals another voice, until the oni agrees to give the stolen voice back (a standard action requiring the oni to touch the victim), or until the next sunrise. Any effect that removes curses (such as remove curse or break enchantment) can restore a stolen voice (DC for success equals the save DC of the steal voice ability-DC 16 for most yamabushi tengu), as does the death of the oni who stole the voice in the first place. The save DC is Charisma-based. Susceptible to Patterns (Ex) A yamabushi tengu takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against illusion spells of the pattern subschool. For 1 round after a yamabushi tengu either makes a successful save against a pattern or recovers from the effects of a pattern, it is dazzled.

Steal Magic (Su) As a standard action, a yamah can make a touch attack against a creature under the effect of a spell or spells and attempt to dispel the effect as per the dispel magic spell (CL 6th). If the attempt is successful, the yamah absorbs the magical energy and converts it into a bolt of force. A yamah can use a force bolt to make a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of force damage for every spell level of the effect dispelled by the yamah (for example, if a yamah dispels a 2nd-level spell with its steal magic ability, the resulting force bolt deals 2d6 points of force damage; 0-level spells count as being 1st-level for the purpose of this ability). These force bolts have a range of 100 feet with no range increment. A yamah can only carry a number of force bolts equal to its Charisma bonus (5 for most yamahs), and any force bolts not used within 24 hours of obtaining them disappear and are wasted.

Creatures caught in the area must succeed on Fortitude save or be affected as if by a confusion spell for 1d6 rounds. Change Shape (Su) At will, a very young or older dungeon dragon can assume the form of any Small or Medium humanoid creature (as the alter self spell). It can remain in its humanoid form indefinitely. It cannot take the form of a specific individual. Craft Crystal Ball (Ex) Dungeon dragon parents begin teaching their wyrmlings the necessary skills and spells to craft a crystal ball soon after they leave the egg. A dungeon dragon gains the Master Craftsman feat for free as a bonus feat without having to meet the prerequisites. Craft Wondrous Item (Ex) Older dungeon dragons create new crystal balls with additional powers as they grow in intelligence and spellcasting ability. A young adult dungeon dragon gains the Craft Wondrous Item feat for free as a bonus feat. Dominate Monster (Sp) A great wyrm dungeon dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a dominate monster spell. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. Skills Dungeon dragons gain a +4 bonus to Perception checks. Spell-like Abilities A dungeon dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-charm person; Juvenile-detect thoughts; Adult-suggestion; Old-charm monster; Ancient-mass suggestion; Great Wyrm-mass charm monster. The dungeon dragon uses these abilities to populate its dungeon with monsters it encounters in the surrounding terrain.

Voice Mimicry (Ex) An ahuizotl can perfectly mimic the sound of humanoid sobbing and can even attempt to mimic voices it has heard. When mimicking a voice, an ahuizotl must make a Bluff check opposed by its listener's Sense Motive check. If the listener has never heard the voice the ahuizotl is attempting to mimic, the listener takes a -8 penalty on the Sense Motive check.																												
Amber Skeleton	6.00	2400	Medium	-1	21, touch 9, flat-footed 21	69	3	2	3			vulnerability to water	30 ft.	spear +14/+9 (1d8+7 plus 2d6 fire) or 2 slams +14 (1d8+5 plus 2d6 fire)		5 ft.	5 ft.	fire bolt, heated body	Str 21, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	9	14	23	Tome of Horrors 4	Fire Bolt (Su) Once per round, as a standard action, an amber skeleton can discharge a line of fire from its spear. The bolt has a range of 40 feet and deals 6d6 points of fire damage against a single target (Reflex save DC 14 for half). This is a function of the amber skeleton and not the spear itself. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Heated Body (Ex) Any creature striking an amber skeleton unarmed or with natural weapons takes 2d6 points of fire damage (no save). Weapons striking an amber skeleton take this same fire damage unless the attacker succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save. Damage caused to weapons in this manner is not halved, but hardness does prevent some of the damage dealt. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) An amber skeleton is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted: A magical attack that deals fire damage heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the amber skeleton to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. An amber skeleton gets no saving throw against fire effects.  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A significant amount of water, such as that created by a create water spell, the contents of a large bucket, or a blow from a water elemental, that strikes an amber skeleton forces the creature to make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 2d4 rounds. An amber skeleton that is immersed in water must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (the DC increases by +1 each subsequent round) or take 1d6 points of damage each round until the water is gone.

Str 27, Dex 10, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 8	7	17	27 (31 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary	Stun (Ex) The ankylosaurus's tail can deliver a powerful, stunning blow. A creature struck by this attack must make a DC 23 save or be dazed for 1 round. If the strike is a critical hit and the target fails its save, it is instead stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.

(good)	2 pincers +7 (1d8+3 plus grab), sting +11 (1d6+6 plus sting)		10 ft.	10 ft.	abyssal torment, breath weapon (30-ft. line, 1d6 fire damage plus accursed brand, Will DC 15 negates, usable every 2d4 rounds), constrict (1d8+9), maddening buzz, mythic power (3/day, surge +1d6), sting	Str 22, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 15	6	+13 (+17 grapple)	23	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Abyssal Torment (Su) An apocalypse locust's sting is designed to torment its victims with wracking pain. A victim of the creature's venomous sting also takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. The effects of abyssal torment last until the sting's poison is cured.  Accursed Brand (Su) Whenever a victim fails its save against an apocalypse locust's breath weapon, the unholy fire burns an accursed brand into his flesh. For the next 24 hours, the branded victim is subjected to auditory hallucinations of foul desires and sinful deeds. The hallucinations cause lawful and good victims to become tainted; good-aligned clerics, druids, paladins, and even lawful monks are treated as though they've temporarily broken their codes of conduct. Any character marked by the accursed brand who has a class that's restricted to a good alignment or lawful alignment is treated as an ex-member of that class for 24 hours; an atonement spell can end this effect.  Maddening Buzz (Su) When three or more apocalypse locusts in a group simultaneously flap their wings, they create a loud buzzing sound capable of driving other creatures mad. Any creature within a range of 100 feet + 10 additional feet per locust must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or go mad as if affected by a confusion spell (caster level equal to the locusts' CR plus the number of locusts present). This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The DC for the save is Charisma-based.  Sting (Ex) Poison-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Con plus abyssal torment; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Apostasy Wraith	6.00	2400	Medium	8	16, touch 16, flat-footed 12	52	4	6	8	channel resistance +4, incorporeal		Razmiri aversion	fly 60 ft.

If confronted by a Razmiri priest or anyone successfully disguised in that garb, the apostasy wraith must make a Will save. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Hit Dice + the Charisma modifier of the highest-level Razmiri priest present. The apostasy wraith needs to make this saving throw only once per encounter, regardless of the number of Razmiri priests present. If the saving throw fails, the apostasy wraith is forced to flee as if affected by the Turn Undead feat. If the save is successful, it overcomes its aversion and gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and deals double damage against Razmiri priests (or those disguised as such) for the duration of the encounter.  Rend Faith (Su) On a successful incorporeal touch attack against a foe with divine spellcasting abilities, the ability to channel energy, or other divinely granted special abilities, the apostasy wraith's inherent spite and contempt toward all things religious disrupts the target's connection with his deity. The victim must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be unable to use any such ability for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Sense Apostate (Su) An apostasy wraith can sense the presence and direction of Razmiri priests as if using the locate creature spell (CL 20th). This ability cannot be dispelled.																												
Astral Shark	6.00	2400	Large	2	19, touch 11, flat-footed 17	68	5	8	9				60 ft.	bite +13 (2d10+7/19-20)		10 ft.	5 ft.	sever silver cord	Str 20, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 12, Cha 6	8	14	26 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Astral Scent (Ex) An astral shark is highly attuned to the energy of a traveler in the Astral Plane and can detect such creatures in a 180-ft. radius.  Sever Silver Cord (Ex) An astral shark can attack an opponent's silver cord with a normal attack that provokes an attack of opportunity. If the astral shark rolls a natural 20 (and subsequently confirms the critical hit), the traveler's silver cord is severed and its material body and astral form are both instantly destroyed.																												
Aswang	6.00	2400	Medium	8	21, touch 14, flat-footed 17	60	4	6	7	channel resistance +4		vulnerability to garlic	40 ft.	2 claws +8 (1d4+2 plus grab), bite +8 (1d6+2/18-20)		5 ft.	5 ft.	blood drain, deceiving sound, devour heart	Str 15, Dex 18, Con -, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 15	6	+8 (+12 grapple)	22	Tome of Horrors 4	Blood Drain (Su) An aswang can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the aswang establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The aswang heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.  Corpse Scent (Ex) An aswang can detect corporeal undead within 100 feet. It can detect fresh corpses (creatures killed within the last two hours) to a range of one mile.  Deceiving Sound (Su) An aswang can produce a ‘tik-tik' sound from its throat that seemingly originates from up to 100 feet away from the aswang's actual location. Creatures hearing this sound can attempt a DC 16 Perception check to pinpoint the aswang's true location.  Devour Heart (Ex) An aswang's bite attack threatens a critical hit on an 18-20. If an aswang kills a foe with a critical hit, it can tear out the victim's heart as a free action. An aswang that devours a victim's heart gains a +4 bonus to Strength for 1 hour. Devouring multiple hearts does not increase this bonus. Such a victim cannot be restored to life by a raise dead spell (though resurrection and true resurrection can still revive the victim). Any creature that witnesses this event must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be shaken 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Vulnerability to Garlic (Ex) Aswangs cannot tolerate the odor of garlic, and will not enter an area laced with it. It doesn't harm an aswang-it merely keeps it at bay.																												
Babau	6.00	2400	Medium	5	19, touch 11, flat-footed 18	73	10	6	5	protective slime	17		30 ft.	2 claws +12 (1d6+5), bite +12 (1d6+5) or longspear +12/+7 (1d8+7/×3), bite +7 (1d6+2)		5 ft.	5 ft.

Any creature that strikes a babau with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of acid damage from this slime if it fails a DC 18 Reflex save. A creature that strikes a babau with a melee weapon must make a DC 18 Reflex save or the weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage; if this damage penetrates the weapon's hardness, the weapon gains the broken condition. Ammunition that strikes a babau is automatically destroyed after it inflicts its damage.																												
Baobhan Sith	6.00	2400	Medium	4	20, touch 15, flat-footed 15	67	9	10	9				30 ft.	2 claws +7 (1d6+3), bite +7 (1d6+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	blood drain, captivating dance, dying words	Str 17, Dex 19, Con 18, Int 16, Wis 16, Cha 19	4	7	22	Tome of Horrors Complete	Blood Drain (Ex) A baobhan sith can suck blood from a grappled or helpless opponent; if she establishes or maintains a pin, she deals bite damage and drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round.  Captivating Dance (Su) When a baobhan sith dances, all living creatures within 30 feet that view the rhythmic swaying and movements of her body must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become utterly enthralled and captivated. Creatures that are sexually attracted to females who view this dance suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected again by the same baobhan sith's captivating dance for one day. A captivated creature is dazed (it cannot attack, but can defend normally). This continues for as long as the baobhan sith dances. A baobhan sith can move and act normally (including using her spelllike abilities) while maintaining her dance. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Dying Words (Sp) When a baobhan sith is slain, she utters a curse as a free action (whether it's her turn or not) that affects her killer as if it were a bestow curse spell (caster level 10th). The target can resist the curse with a successful DC 19 Will save. If the save fails, the target suffers a -6 decrease to its highest ability score. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Belker	6.00	2400	Large	5	20, touch 14, flat-footed 15	68	9	11	2				30 ft., fly 50 ft. (perfect)	bite +12 (1d6+2), 2 claws +12 (1d6+2), 2 wings +10 (1d6+1)		10 ft.	10 ft.	smoke claws	Str 14, Dex 21, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 10	8	11	26 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Smoke Claws (Ex) A belker using its smoke form ability can enter a target's square as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or inhale part of the creature.  Smoke inside the victim solidifies into a claw and attacks the target from within, dealing 3d4 points of damage per round as a swift action. If the target moves, the belker may automatically move with the target (this movement does not count toward the belker's movement and does not provoke attacks of opportunity against the belker). Each round, the target can attempt another DC 17 Fortitude to cough out the belker's smoke, which ends the smoke claws attack and forces the belker into an adjacent square. Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to this attack.  The save DC is Constitution-based.  Smoke Form (Su) A belker can switch from its normal form to one of pure smoke or back again a swift action. It can spend up to 20 rounds per day in smoke form. In smoke form, the belker acts as if under the effects of a gaseous form spell, except that it retains its natural fly speed of 50 feet (perfect).																												
Berbalang	6.00	2400	Medium	4	20, touch 15, flat-footed 15	68	6	6	9	projection			40 ft., fly 60 ft. (good)	bite +9 (1d6+3 plus paralysis), 2 claws +9 (1d6+3 plus paralysis) or   incorporeal touch +10 (1d4 Con damage)		5 ft.	5 ft.	paralysis (1d4+1 rounds, DC 18)	Str 17, Dex 19, Con -, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 18	6	9	26	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Projection (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a berbalang can enter a trance that separates the creature's spirit from its body. This splits the berbalang's current hit points in half between its body and its spirit. The berbalang's spirit body gains the incorporeal subtype and special ability; otherwise, it retains the same statistics as its physical self with the following changes: AC 19, touch 19, flat-footed 14 (+4 Dex, +4 deflection, +1 dodge), single incorporeal touch attack that deals 1d4 Constitution damage on a hit as its sole attack. This spirit projection can travel no more than 1 mile away from the berbalang's body. Because the creature is only partially in existence when in this state, its body gains displacement as the spell. When separated in this way, the berbalang's body is unconscious and helpless. If the berbalang's body is injured while in this state, the separated projection immediately returns to its body, and the body loses displacement. If the physical body is slain, the spirit body immediately dies as well. If the spirit is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it returns to the body immediately. A berbalang in spirit form can end the effect at any time as a standard action, at which point the spirit immediately returns to the body. When a berbalang's spirit form returns to the body, add both the spirit body's hit points and the physical body's hit points back together to determine the creature's current hit point total.																												
Bhuta	6.00	2400	Medium	6	19, touch 12, flat-footed 17	67	5	5	10	channel resistance +2			30 ft.	2 claws +12 (1d8+5 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	death grip	Str 20, Dex 14, Con -, Int 12, Wis 16, Cha 14	6	17	34	Tome of Horrors Complete	Death Grip (Ex) A bhuta deals 1d8+5 points of damage with a successful grapple check each round the hold is maintained. Because it seizes its victim by the throat, a creature in its grasp cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.  Find Target (Sp) So long as the bhuta and its killer are on the same plane of existence, it can find its target unerringly as though guided by discern location (caster level 9th).  Gentle Repose (Ex) When it first rises from the dead, a bhuta is preserved as if by gentle repose for a period of 14 days.  After that time, its body begins to decay and it takes on an appearance similar to that of a ghoul or zombie.

This deals 2d6 points of fire damage (in addition to constriction damage) to the grappled target each round the grapple persists. Once the grapple ends, the blaze boa's fire burns out. A blaze boa can stop and restart this ability as a free action (once per turn), but can only use it if it is grappling a foe.																												
Blighted Fey	6.00	2400	Medium	2	20, touch 13, flat-footed 17	76	6	8	8	fungal rejuvenation	17		40 ft.	dagger +6 (1d4+4/19-20), horns +1 (1d6+2)	shortbow +6 (1d6/x3)	5 ft.	5 ft.	parasitic bond, pipes, thorn throw	Str 18, Dex 15, Con 19, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 21	4	8	21	Inner Sea Bestiary	Pipes (Su) A satyr can focus and empower his magic by playing haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot radius must make a successful DC 18 Will save or be affected by charm person, fear, sleep, or suggestion, depending on which tune the satyr chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes' effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the satyr's other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use of his pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spell-like abilities, and if separated from them, he may continue to use his standard abilities.  The pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Blodeuwedd	6.00	2400	Medium	5	20, touch 16, flat-footed 14	66	7	10	8				30 ft.	2 claws +8 (1d8+4)	mwk sling +9 (1d4+4)	5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 18, Dex 21, Con 21, Int 14, Wis 17, Cha 18	3	7	23	AP 33	Allergen Aura (Ex) A blodeuwedd exudes an aura of pollen and other irritating allergens that forces living creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened, coughing and sneezing for 1d6 rounds. Creatures who successfully save cannot be affected by the same blodeuwedd's aura for 24 hours. A blodeuwedd can suppress this aura at will as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based. Change Shape (Su) A blodeuwedd can assume a single unique humanoid shape or the form of a prairie owl once per day for up to 7 hours as if using the spell polymorph. These hours do not need to be consecutive and a blodeuwedd can return to her normal shape as a free action. Nature's Infusion (Su) Once per day, while surrounded by any field or fertile plain, a blodeuwedd may infuse herself with borrowed life energy from nearby plants and nutrients in the ground. This ability functions exactly like false life (CL 7th) but lasts only 1 hour. Verdant Step (Su) Every stride taken by a blodeuwedd causes small plants, grasses, and wildflowers to sprout from the ground, though she can suppress this effect if she desires. While within a plain of tall grass, brush, or similar undergrowth, a blodeuwedd may also step through such plant-life and emerge at any other point within the same field (potentially miles away). This ability functions similar to transport via plants, but a blodeuwedd can only transport herself and does not require a plant equal to her size. This ability is usable three times per day. Wild Empathy (Ex) This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except a blodeuwedd has a +6 racial bonus on the check. A blodeuwedd with druid levels adds this racial modifier to her wild empathy checks.																												
Blood Golem	6.00	2400	Medium	4	20, touch 14, flat-footed 16	64	2	6	4	amorphous		vulnerable to bleed	10 ft.	2 slams +10 (2d6+2 plus bleed and grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (1d6), blood drain (1d2 Con), constrict (2d6+2 plus bleed)	Str 14, Dex 19, Con -, Int -, Wis 14, Cha 1	8	+10 (+14 grapple)	24	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Blood Drain (Su) A blood golem heals 5 hit points each round it drains blood.  Clotted Skin (Ex) A blood golem can congeal its surface into a hard skin as a full-round action, allowing it to assume a vaguely humanoid form. With its skin, it gains DR 5/bludgeoning, natural armor +6, and speed 30, but loses its amorphous and compression abilities. It can liquefy this skin as a full-round action, losing its DR and natural armor, changing its speed to 10 feet, and regaining the amorphous and compression abilities. The golem normally maintains its congealed skin, liquefying itself only when it has to pass through obstacles that would hinder its solid form.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A blood golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature. • Cure spells affect it as if it were a living creature, but only cure the minimum amount of damage. • Spells and effects that specifically affect blood (such as boiling bloodAPG) affect it normally.  Vulnerable to Bleed (Ex) Bleed effects, blood drain, and attacks that target a creature's blood affect a blood golem normally. The golem can spend a full-round action to harden its clotted outer shell to end a bleed effect.																												
Bloodhaze Mosquito Swarm	6.00	2400	Fine	2	20, touch 20, flat-footed 18	71	9	6	5	swarm traits		swarm traits	5 ft., fly 30 ft.

A creature with bloodhaze mosquitoes clinging to it takes 1 point of Constitution damage at the end of its turn for the next 1d4 rounds. As a full-round action, the creature can remove the mosquitoes with a DC 18 Reflex save or by immersing itself in water. High winds or any amount of damage from an area-affecting effect destroys all clinging mosquitoes. The save DC is Dexterity-based. Once a group of clinging mosquitoes has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, the mosquitoes detach and disperse to digest their meal. Disease (Ex) Bloodhaze mosquitoes are bearers of a terrifying and deadly disease common to the jungle, known to most locals as sleeping sickness. Sleeping Sickness: Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d2 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d4 Wisdom damage and target is fatigued, cure 2 consecutive saves or arsenic (see page 35 for more details).																												
Bloodsuckle	6.00	2400	Large	4	17, touch 9, flat-footed 17	68	10	4	4				0 ft. (immobile)	2 tendrils +9 (1d4+3 plus grab plus create host) or 4 limb rakes +8 (1d6+3)		10 ft.	10 ft.

Once it has dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, it releases victim so it can use it again later as a food source. Bloodsuckles never kill those they have transformed into hosts unless they are extremely hungry. Create Host (Ex) A bloodsuckle that strikes a living target with a tendril injects a special poison sap into the victim that requires a DC 18 Will save, or the victim is transformed into a host. This acts as a dominate monster spell (caster level 8th) with no limit on its duration. Immunity or resistance to poison applies normally to this sap. The save DC is Constitutionbased. A victim that becomes a host returns to the plant whenever it calls. It is normally used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack may be summoned for defense. A host with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its alignment (such as attacking allies) is allowed another Will save with a +4 bonus to break the bloodsuckle's control. Host Sense (Ex) A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any hosts within 100 feet. Seed (Ex) Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implants in a host's body. The host wanders off and 1d4 days later, the seed breaks open growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. When its Constitution reaches 0, the host dies and a new bloodsuckle erupts from the corpse and takes root. A remove disease spell destroys the seedling. Summon Host (Ex) As free action, a bloodsuckle can generate a high-pitched whine that only its hosts can hear. A host that hears this call proceeds immediately at its highest rate of speed and in the most direct route toward the plant. The whine can be heard by a host within 2 miles of the bloodsuckle.

Creatures afflicted with bog rot do not heal naturally and gain only one-half benefit from magical healing until the disease is cured. Unlike normal diseases, bog rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or receives a remove disease spell or similar magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid that dies from bog rot becomes a bog mummy in 1d4 days unless a remove disease is cast (within one day after death) or the creature is brought back to life (raise dead is ineffective, but resurrection or true resurrection works). Spawn are under the command of the bog mummy that created them and remain enslaved until their death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.  Despair (Su) All creatures within a 30-feet radius that see a bog mummy must make a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same bog mummy's despair ability for one day. This is a paralysis and a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Marsh Move (Ex) Bog mummies can move at their normal movement speed through mud, marshes, and swamps with no penalty.																												
Bogeyman	6.00	2400	Medium	7	16, touch 16, flat-footed 13	60	5	5	13	incorporeal, channel resistance +2			30 ft.	incorporeal touch +10 (1d6)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bump in the night, frighten	Str -, Dex 17, Con -, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 16	6	9	32	Tome of Horrors Complete	Bump in the Night (Su) A bogeyman can create a phantasmagoric image in the mind of a single creature within 200 feet. Such images cause the victim to see and hear things that are not really there or to see and hear things differently than they actually are. Things such as following footsteps, bumps and thumps from an unknown source, a gnarled tree with outstretched limbs scratching on a window or reaching for someone, the idea that someone or something is lurking around the corner, in the closet, or under the bed, and so on.  A creature affected by the images takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if it fails a DC 19 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the bogeyman's Ability Focus feat. The bogeyman can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds.  A creature who drops to Wisdom 0 is affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 8th) until at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored.  Frighten (Su) A living creature within 60 feet that views a bogeyman must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or stand frozen in fear for 1d6+2 rounds. Such a creature is not helpless, but cannot take any action. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same bogeyman's frighten ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shadow Shift (Su) A bogeyman has the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell.  The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A bogeyman can shift up to a total of 80 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 80 feet or multiple jumps of 10 feet each. This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.

The save DC is Constitution-based. Wind Form (Su) A bralani can shift between its humanoid body and a body made of wind and mist as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its whirlwind blast. In wind form, it functions as if under the effects of a wind walk spell. It can make slam attacks and use spelllike abilities in either form. A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.

Death Throes (Su) When reduced to 0 or less hit points, a brykolakas is destroyed and its body changes into a pool of deadly poison that quickly (1 round) fills a 10-foot cube (if its in the water when destroyed). The poison disperses in the next round. Creatures in the area are exposed to the poison.  If a brykolakas is slain on land, its body collapses into a puddle of briny liquid that quickly covers a 10-foot square area. The puddle lasts for 1d2 rounds before dispersing.  Creatures touching the puddle are exposed to the poison.  Brykolakas poison-Contact; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Disease (Su) A brykolakas's claw attacks deliver a virulent disease that breaks down the victim's internal organs (causing internal bleeding and a darkening of the skin). This supernatural disease is called brykolakas fever. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Brykolakas fever-Claw; disease, save Fortitude DC 16 negates, onset 1 minute, frequency 1/day, effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Dex damage, cure 1 save.

It takes 1 full round for the plant to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a plant of the same type as the one animating it (exceptions are noted in each entry below), gaining the plant guardian's vulnerability to fire. If the plant guardian that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the plant immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.  Double Damage against Objects (Ex) A plant guardian or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.  Plantspeech (Ex) A plant guardian has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an attitude of friendly or helpful.  Needles (Ex) The body and limbs of a cactant are covered in the characteristic needles of a cactus, and deal 1d4 bleed damage with a slam attack. Any creature grappling a cactant or attacking it with a natural weapon automatically takes bleed damage.  Needle Storm (Ex) Once per round as a standard action, a cactant can release a hail of needles in a 30-foot-radius burst. Creatures caught in the area take 7d6 points of piercing damage and 2d4 bleed damage. A successful DC 18 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the bleed damage. A cactant can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds, and no more than five times per day. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Vulnerable to Magical Light (Ex) A carrion claw that is the target of a spell with the light descriptor must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round.

The substance instantly solidifies to a rock-like hardness, forming needlesharp spears of crystal that impale those in the area and deal 3d6 points of piercing damage. A DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Crystalline Mandibles (Ex) The mandibles of a caterprism are so sharp that they can bite through nearly anything.  The bite attack of a caterprism is treated like a touch attack; i.e., it ignores any armor bonus. Further, the bite of a caterprism is considered to have the vorpal special quality, and on a successful critical hit with its bite attack, the caterprism severs the head of its opponent.

This ability functions as the bard ability of the same name.  Harmonize (Sp) When choral angels work together, they can use their complementary voices to create mystical harmonies. Two or more choral angels within 60 feet of one another can use calm emotions or heroism as a spell-like ability, four or more choral angels can use shout, and six or more choral angels can use greater heroism or holy word. Only the choral angel who actually uses the spell-like ability in question must take a standard action to achieve this effect-the other choral angels need only take swift actions during the same round.  Piercing Hymn (Su) As a standard action, a choral angel can launch a concentrated blast of sonic energy from its mouth. This attack has a range of 90 feet with no range increment.

No creature in the group is considered flanked or flat-footed unless all of them are.  Cooperative Scrying (Sp) Three or more caulborn or chrestomaths who maintain physical contact can scry on a place or creature as if using the scrying spell (DC 20), but with no limit to the spell's duration so long as at least three of the participants involved continue to touch and concentrate. This ability functions at caster level 7th (or at the highest caster level available to the most powerful participant in the group). The save DC is Charisma-based, adjusted by the modifier of the participant with the highest Charisma score.  Mind Flood (Su) A chrestomath can target any creature it detects with its thoughtsense ability with a deadly psychic attack, flooding the target creature's head with so much obscure knowledge that it drives the target insane. Any creature affected by the mind blast must make a successful DC 19 Will save or take 1d6 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage and be confused (as per the spell confusion) for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  Psychic Deflection (Su) A chrestomath adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC. In addition, all caulborn (though not other chrestomaths) within 300 feet of a chrestomath gain half of this deflection bonus as well, with the effects stacking with those from other chrestomaths and the caulborn's own psychic deflection ability. These bonuses cease when the chrestomath is unconscious.  Racial Memory (Ex) As a full-round action, any caulborn within 300 feet of a chrestomath may access the latter's racial memory to gain half the chrestomath's Knowledge skill bonus as a bonus on its own Knowledge check. In addition, the chrestomath instantly acquires any piece of information learned by any caulborn that comes within 300 feet of it. This information may then be shared by any other caulborn and chrestomaths with 300 feet.  Thoughtsense (Su) A chrestomath notices and locates living, conscious creatures within 60 feet just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Spells such as nondetection or mind blank make an affected creature undetectable by this sense.

Standby (Ex) A clockwork soldier can place itself on standby as a standard action. While on standby, a clockwork soldier cannot move or take any actions.

Spawn are under the command of the darnoc that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Curse of the Grave (Su) Any damage dealt by a darnoc's slam attack does not heal naturally and resists all magical healing (potions, cure spells, and so on). Before the damage can be healed, the curse must first be broken with a break enchantment or remove curse spell (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell). Ghost Form (Su) As a standard action, a darnoc can become incorporeal for up to 10 minutes each day.

Symbol of Discord (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a darnoc can scribe a symbol in the air. All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet who see the symbol must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds.

If a creature damages a death worm with a piercing or slashing weapon made of metal, the creature's blood deals 3d6 points of acid damage to the metal weapon (unlike most forms of energy damage, this damage is not halved when applied to a metal object, although it does still have to penetrate the metal's hardness). The weapon's wielder can halve the damage the weapon takes by making a successful DC 17 Reflex save. Creatures made of metal that deal slashing or piercing damage to a death worm with a natural attack take 3d6 points of acid damage (a DC 17 Reflex save halves this damage). The corrosive elements of the blood fade 1 round after it leaves the worm's body or the worm dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Electrical Jolt (Su) A death worm can fire a jolt of electricity from its mouth as a standard action. The range increment for this ranged touch attack is 60 feet.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury, or skin-contact; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 2 saves.  Venomous Skin (Ex) A death worm's skin secretes a noxious, waxy substance. This venomous sheen poisons any creature that touches a death worm, either by making a successful attack with an unarmed strike or natural weapon or with a touch attack. A creature that grapples a death worm is also exposed to the creature's venomous skin.

Any creature within the infestation takes 1d6 points of damage at the end of each round it remains in the area. A creature that takes this damage must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. In addition, those damaged by this infestation are poisoned as well. Any area effect attack that deals 10 or more points of damage to a deathweb destroys its infesting spiders, removing its aura for 3 rounds, after which a new batch of spiders swarms out of the undead's body to replenish the infestation. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Delgeth	6.00	2400	Medium	6	18, touch 12, flat-footed 16	68	9	8	10				50 ft.	gore +12 (1d8+4 plus 1d6 fire), 2 hooves +10 (1d4+2 plus 1d6 fire)		5 ft.	5 ft.	fight with fire, flight of flames	Str 19, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 14	8	20	34 (can't be tripped)	Tears At Bitter Manor	Fight with Fire (Su) A delgeth can strike at the ground with its flaming hooves as a swift action, causing blazing sparks to appear in a square of the delgeth's choosing within 30 feet. A creature in that square must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Flight of Flames (Su) A delgeth can use its smoldering hooves to ignite the ground and brush when it runs or withdraws, creating a blazing trail of fire behind it. The fire fills every square the delgeth moves through during its run or withdraw action. When the fire appears and on each of the delgeth's turns, the flames deal 2d6 points of fire damage to each creature in one of the squares of fire and 2d4 points of fire damage to each creature within 5 feet of such a square but not inside one. The flames gutter out after 3 rounds, but can be extinguished before then by any means that would extinguish normal nonmagical fires of their size. The flames can ignite flammable debris, but in normal forest conditions they rarely spread.

This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The target can resist the attack by succeeding on a DC 18 Will save. If the save fails, the target dies as the shock of unlife permeates its soul. If the save succeeds, that creature cannot be affected again by the same demiurge's soul touch for one day. This is a death effect.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Transfixing Gaze (Su) Any creature within 30 feet meeting the demiurge's gaze must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be transfixed for one minute as if affected by a hold person spell (caster level 10th). An affected creature can attempt a new save each round to break the effects.  Vulnerability to Iron (Ex) A cold iron weapon ignores the demiurge's incorporeal state and deals normal damage.

Str 20, Dex 18, Con 21, Int 13, Wis 17, Cha 11	8	14	28 (32 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Elemental Endurance (Ex) An ebony horse can remain on the Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 24 hours at a time. An ebony horse can extend this protection to its rider and up to four of the rider's allies in a 30 foot radius around itself. If the ebony and horse and any protected allies move more than 30 feet apart, the protection ends for that individual and cannot be regained for 24 hours. If the ebony horse is killed, this protection ends immediately. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes an ebony horse to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane. Other creatures protected by elemental endurance suffer damage normally from the elemental plane when that time expires.

Creatures in this area take 1d8+5 points of damage (DC 17 Reflex half ). In addition, a nirento can attempt to trip any creatures that fail their Reflex saves as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Because each of its two heads controls an arm, the ettin does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons. Ettins, or two-headed giants, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk the night. Their two heads provide them with unparalleled powers of perception, making them excellent guards.

It cannot be flanked.  Eye Rays (Su) Each of the creature's eyes stalks can produce a magical ray once per round as a free action.  The creature can aim both of its eye rays in any direction.  Each of its eye rays resembles a spell cast by a 12th-level caster and follows the rules for a ray (see Aiming a Spell in the Core Rulebook). Each eye ray has a range of 150 feet and a save DC of 17. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Hold Person Left eye-A target struck by this ray must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the spell. An eye of the deep will use this ray early in a fight so as to disable its opponents.  Hold Monster Right eye-A target struck by this ray must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the spell. This is used in the same manner as the hold person ray.  Minor Image By combining the rays of both eyes, the eye of the deep can replicate the minor image spell. It does not have to succeed on an attack roll to use this ray. The illusion is generated at any point within range and in the eye of the deep's line of sight.  Stun Cone (Su) An eye of the deep's central eye can, once per round, produce a cone extending straight ahead from its front to a range of 30 feet. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A creature that makes its save is immune to the horrific visage of that fachan for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. One-Legged Stance (Ex) Fachans are surprisingly nimble while hopping on their single leg. This unusual mode of movement allows the fachans to ignore the effects of difficult terrain on movement and makes it impossible to trip.  Powerful Grip (Ex) A fachan can wield a two-handed weapon in its single hand, gaining all the usual benefits for wielding a two-handed weapon.

The feral vampire spawn heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.  Energy Drain (Su) A creature hit by a feral vampire spawn's slam gains one negative level. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks the feral vampire spawn makes.  Fast Healing (Su) A feral vampire spawn has fast healing 2. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a feral vampire spawn forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, it is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round.  Gaseous Form (Su) A feral vampire spawn can only assume gaseous form when it has been reduced to 0 hit points in combat. It then assumes gaseous form as the spell (caster level 5th) and returns to its coffin. While gaseous it has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.  Shadowless (Ex) A feral vampire spawn casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror.  Spider Climb (Ex) A feral vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.

Crush attacks are effective only against opponents one or more size categories smaller than the frog stone idol. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the stone idol's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the stone idol moves off them. If the stone idol chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Powerful Leaper (Ex) A frog stone idol uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics checks made to jump, and it has a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A stone idol is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone idol (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the stone idol's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.  A disintegrate spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol.  A chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight spell deals 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells.  Rejuvenation (Su) Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in 1d4+2 days.  Site Bound (Ex) A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it is brought back into the area.

This ability is similar to the alter self spell (CL18th), but the gallu-demon can remain in the new form indefinitely. Dimension Door (Su) At the gallu-demon's option, it can use dimension door to transport a grappled victim (who gets no saving throw) within the same plane, instead of its plane shift ability. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name. Plane Shift (Su) A gallu-demon can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Abyss. This ability transports the gallu-demon and one grappled victim (who gets no save to avoid the shift). It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name.

Creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save take 3d6 damage. Since the effect stems from the vibrations set up in a victim's body and not from the clicking noise itself, silence offers no protection against this attack. Likewise, a creature that cannot hear can still be affected. A successful save renders the target immune to that death watch beetle's death rattle for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Immunity to Death Effects (Ex) Death watch beetles are immune to any effect that instantly slays it, such as finger of death, slay living, and so on.

A frozen creature can break free of the ice by making a successful DC 19 Strength check. The ice is AC 10, hardness 0, and has 10 hit points per 5-foot section. A frozen creature cannot use a weapon to break free even if it was holding it when it was frozen. Spells with verbal, material, or somatic components cannot be cast by a creature encased in ice. The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  Transparent (Ex) A glacial ooze is hard to identify, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a glacial ooze and walk into it are automatically engulfed.																												
Glacier Toad	6.00	2400	Large	1	19, touch 10, flat-footed 18	73	10	8	3			vulnerable to fire	30 ft., swim 15 ft.	bite +13 (2d6+9 plus 1d6 cold and grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	swallow whole (1d4 bludgeoning and 1d6 cold, AC 14, 7 hp)	Str 23, Dex 13, Con 20, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 6	7	+14 (+18 grapple)	25 (29 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Bitter Cold (Su) All creatures within 20 feet of a glacier toad take 1d6 points of cold damage each round on the toad's turn.																												
Golden Guardian	6.00	2400	Medium	-1	19, touch 9, flat-footed 19	64	2	1	2	conductivity, heat shimmer	17		20 ft.	2 slams +12 (1d8+4 plus 1d6 fire)		5 ft.	5 ft.	heat, molten destruction	Str 18, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	8	12	21	City of Golden Death	Conductivity (Ex) A magical attack that deals electricity damage speeds up a golden guardian (as the haste spell) for 1d4 rounds. A golden guardian gets no saving throw against electricity effects. Heat (Ex) A golden guardian's body generates intense heat, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples. Creatures attacking a golden guardian with unarmed strikes or natural weapons are also subject to the golden guardian's heat. Molten Destruction (Ex) When reduced to 0 hit points, a golden guardian superheats and instantly melts into a pile of molten gold. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius spread take 6d6 points of fire damage; a DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Heat Shimmer (Ex) The intense heat radiating from a golden guardian's body creates a wavering shimmer in the air that makes the construct difficult to see clearly. This functions as a blur spell (CL 8th), except it cannot be dispelled.																												
Gray-Scale Inphidian	6.00	2400	Large	-1	17, touch 8, flat-footed 17	76	6	5	7				30 ft., climb 30 ft., swim 20 ft.	2 snake-hands +13 (1d8+6 plus poison and grab), bite +13 (2d6+6/19-20 plus poison)		10 ft.	10 ft.

It grants the gray-scale a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against spellcasters. A gray-scale with this special ability also takes a -2 penalty on all saves against spells and spell-like abilities.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save DC 20 Fort; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str and 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Uncontrolled Rage Uncontrolled Rage is a new feat detailed in the appendix.																												
Greater Host Devil	6.00	2400	Medium	4	23, touch 15, flat-footed 18	59	8	9	3		17		20 ft., fly 50 ft. (average)	mwk ranseur +12 (2d4+6), 2 claws +11 (1d6+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	infernal wound, noxious breath, rend (2 claws, 1d6+1), summon devil	Str 18, Dex 19, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 11	7	10	25	Book of the Damned V1	Infernal Wound (Ex) The damage a magaav deals with its claws or rend causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 1 additional hit point each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 16 Heal check or any spell that cures hit point damage; casting a curative spell on the injured creature requires a successful DC 15 caster level check, otherwise the spell has no effect. The check DC is Constitution-based. Master Grappler (Ex) A magaav can wield a weapon and still make grapple checks. If it's not wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks. Noxious Breath (Su) Three times per day, a magaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitutionbased. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same magaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonuses on their saving throws. Once a magaav uses its breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. Shared Senses (Su) All gaavs (and magaavs) within 100 feet of one another share the same senses. Thus, if one individual perceives something (for example, with a successful Perception check), all others within range are immediately aware of it. Senses are instantly relayed from one gaav or magaav to the next, allowing for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread through and inform an entire massive swarm instantly. It is still possible for a magaav to be surprised or flat-footed even if other gaavs or magaavs nearby are not. All magaavs may telepathically communicate with all other gaavs and magaavs within 100 feet at once, allowing the greater host devils to command entire swarms. Although magaavs rarely contradict one another, if faced with competing orders, gaavs follow the commands of the closest magaav. Summon Devil (Su) Once per day a magaav can attempt to summon 1d2 gaavs with a 60% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

When the fiddlers play, any non-sprite within 30 feet of the instruments must make a successful DC 17 Will save or be affected as though by irresistible dance for as long as the playing continues. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Grimslake	6.00	2400	Large	5	19, touch 10, flat-footed 18	68	6	5	10	slashing scales			20 ft., burrow 20 ft., climb 20 ft.	bite +11 (2d6+6 plus grab), sting +11 (1d6+6 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	constrict (1d6+6), marrow drain, penetrating jaws	Str 22, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 11	6	+13 (+17 grapple)	24 (can't be tripped)	The Worldwound	Marrow Drain (Ex) A grimslake's tail is covered with suckers that extend long, thin, razor-sharp tendrils to drill into its victim's bones, draining them of marrow. The grimslake can drain marrow from any creature it is grappling or from any helpless creature as a swift action. The victim can resist this painful attack with a successful DC 18 Fortitude save; otherwise, he becomes staggered from the horrific agony for 1 round and takes 1 point of Constitution drain. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Penetrating Jaws (Su) A grimslake's bite attack penetrates cold iron and silver damage reduction.  Slashing Scales (Ex) The scales running in a line down a grimslake's back have razor-sharp ridges and spines, and the creature is adept at lashing at attackers with these scales. Any creature that attacks a grimslake with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or light weapon must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid taking 1d4 points of slashing damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based.																												
Guardian Cimota	6.00	2400	Medium	8	20, touch 14, flat-footed 16	85	8	7	8	channel resistance +4, displacement, unholy existence	15		fly 60 ft. (good)	2 scimitars +11 (1d6+4 plus 1d6 negative energy/18-20, evil-aligned)		5 ft.	5 ft.	manifestation, superior two-weapon fighting	Str 18, Dex 16, Con -, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 22	6	10	20	Tome of Horrors 4	Displacement (Su) Cimota manifest on the Prime Material Plane as a shifting cloud of shadows that coalesce into their cloaked and hooded forms. On any round that a cimota first manifests (see below), its shifting forms affect it as a displacement spell. Attacks on a cimota at this time have a 50% miss chance as if the cimota had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, this displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting a cimota normally. This effect is canceled one round after a cimota manifests, or if a cimota takes any action in its new locale.  Lifesense (Su) A cimota notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Manifestation (Su) As a standard action, a cimota can transport itself via planar travel from any point on the Prime Material Plane to another point within its defined area, or within 300 feet of the artifact to which it is bound. A cimota may also lurk on the Negative Material Plane, prepared to manifest on the Prime Material if certain conditions are met, such as trespassers entering the area they are doomed to guard. A cimota cannot attack or move in the same round in which it manifests, although it may manifest as partial surprise action before initiative. A cimota benefits from displacement (see above) on the round in which it first manifests.  Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex) A black skeleton usually fights with a short sword in each hand. Because of its magical nature, its Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with both weapons at no penalty.  Unholy Existence (Su) Although it is possible to temporarily destroy a cimota's physical form, it will return in 1d6 days, manifesting again to continue its unholy existence. The only way to permanently destroy a cimota is to disrupt its existence by consecrating the ground to which it is tied or the destruction of the artifact to which it is bound. Sometimes, significant alteration of an unholy place, such as demolition of an evil temple or burning a haunted forest, could cause cimota to fade away permanently. Although their physical forms may be damaged by normal attacks, their unholy existence grants them spell resistance 17. Because cimota exist partially on the Negative Material Plane they are subject to banishment or other spells that affect outsiders.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a cimota unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. This aura takes effect when a cimota manifests on the Prime Material Plane. Animals that come within 30 feet of a place where cimota are lurking on the Negative Material Plane, or an artifact to which a cimota is bound; Will be uneasy and show signs of disquiet.

Once the target is pinned, the helicoprion continues to do its bite damage (including bleed) for as long as it maintains the pin.																												
Hell Moth	6.00	2400	Large	7	19, touch 12, flat-footed 16	76	6	6	7				10 ft., fly 40 ft.

Attacks that hit an engulfing hell moth deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.  Immolation (Su) A hell moth that has engulfed an opponent can detonate its body in a blast of hellish fire that deals 6d10 points of fire damage to itself and the engulfed opponent (no save). (Reduce the damage dealt to the hell moth by its fire resistance.) A hell moth can immolate itself once every 3 hours (providing it survives the immolation).  Creatures within 10 feet of the hell moth when it uses this ability must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes and combustibles ignite.  The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the hell moth uses this ability or until the fire is extinguished. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Favored Terrain (Ex) A herne gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when it is in forest terrain. A herne traveling through forest terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he can leave a trail if he so chooses).  Martial Training (Ex) A herne is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).  Swift Tracker (Ex) A herne can move at its normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. A herne takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving up to twice its normal speed while tracking.

A hodag's tail slap is a primary attack.  Toss (Ex) A hodag charging 20 feet or more that damages a foe with an attack can throw its foe with a special combat maneuver check. The opponent must be corporeal and at least one size category smaller than the hodag. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the hodag's opponent is thrown 10 feet through the air in a direction chosen by the hodag and falls prone. The hodag can only toss its opponent in a straight line.  If an obstacle prevents the creature's movement, both the creature tossed and the object struck take 1d6 points of damage, and the creature falls prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. A hodag can also toss an opponent 10 feet up into the air. The victim lands in the same square it started in, falls prone, and takes 1d6 points of damage.  Trackless (Ex) A hodag sweeps its tail behind itself in a way that obscures its tracks. Attempts to track a hodag have their normal DC increased by +10.

While not wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks.  Noxious Breath (Su) Three times per day, as a standard action a magaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same magaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Shared Senses (Su) All magaavs within 100 feet of one another share the same senses. Thus, if one individual perceives something (for example, with a successful Perception check), all others within range are immediately aware of it. Senses are instantly relayed from one magaav to the next, allowing for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread through and inform an entire swarm instantly. It is still possible for a magaav to be flat-footed for other reasons even if other magaavs nearby are not.																												
Huge Salt Elemental	6.00	2400	Huge	0	18, touch 9, flat-footed 17	68	9	2	6			vulnerability to water	20 ft.	2 claws +11 (2d6+5 plus salt poisoning)		15 ft.	15 ft.	salt poisoning (11 rounds, DC 17)	Str 21, Dex 10, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	8	15	26	Tome of Horrors 4	Dehydration Aura (Su) A salt elemental's aura draws moisture from an area centered on itself. Living creatures within range take damage (damage is detailed with each elemental) each round they remain in the area. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. This effect is especially devastating to plants, animals, and aquatic creatures, which take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Earth Mastery (Ex) A salt elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)  Salt Poisoning (Ex) Anyone hit by a salt elemental's claw attack is sickened for 3 rounds + 1 round per Hit Dice of the salt elemental. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A salt elemental submerged in water that covers at least half its body takes 1d6 points of damage each round until it escapes.

This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Enveloping Mists (Ex) A hungry fog can engulf foes (see Universal Monster Rules in the Appendices). A creature engulfed by a hungry fog does not gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it is  staggered in addition to the damage the attack causes. The save DC to avoid the enveloping mists is Constitution-based.  Gaseous (Ex) A hungry fog has a body composed of eerie mist. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects as a result.  Vulnerable to Wind (Ex) A hungry fog is treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it (see page 439 of the Core Rulebook).

Dancing Chains (Su) A kyton can control up to four chains within 20 feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, a kyton can increase these chains' length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-edged barbs. These chains attack as effectively as the kyton itself. If a chain is in another creature's possession, the creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to break the kyton's power over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 hours or until the chain leaves the creature's possession. A kyton can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without making Climb checks. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Unnerving Gaze (Su) Range 30 ft., Will DC 15 negates. A kyton can make its face resemble one of an opponent's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. Those who fail their saves become shaken for 1d3 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

As a result, lamias wield weapons as if they were one size category smaller than their actual size (Medium for most lamias). Wisdom Drain (Su) A lamia drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its melee touch attack. (Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a lamia does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.) Lamias try to use this power early in an encounter to make foes more susceptible to charm monster and suggestion.																												
Lantern Goat	6.00	2400	Medium	8	19, touch 15, flat-footed 14	68	5	6	6				30 ft.	head butt +10 (1d6+1), 2 hooves +10 (1d4+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	fear light, soul capture	Str 13, Dex 18, Con -, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 17	6	7	22 (26 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Fear Light (Su) A lantern goat can emit an ugly yellow light from the lantern around its neck as a free action. All creatures within 60 feet that view this light must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be panicked for 1d4+4 rounds. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the fear light of that lantern goat for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Lifesense (Su) A lantern goat notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.  Soul Capture (Su) Any living creature reduced to below 0 hit points while within 60 feet of a lantern goat must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or have its soul drawn into the lantern goat's lantern. The DC increases by +1 for every hit point the character is below 0 (e.g., a character at -3 hit points must save at DC 20). Once captured, the lantern goat slowly digests the creature's soul over a period of 1 hour, using it to fuel its dark energies. A creature slain in this manner can only be returned to life by a resurrection, true resurrection, wish, or miracle. Raise dead has no effect on such a slain creature. If the lantern goat is slain and the lantern destroyed, the soul is released back to the body if still living. The lantern cannot be destroyed or removed until the lantern goat is destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals. Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals. Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

Creatures viewing this burst must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. See the table below for the save DC for each positive energy elemental's blinding flash. The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Throes (Su) A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura). Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's positive energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's positive energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. All creatures in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC as the elemental's positive energy save DC) or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Positive Energy (Ex) A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with positive energy. This deals extra damage to an undead or negative energy based target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) by the same amount. Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later.

The save DC is Strength-based.  An engulfed creature can be freed by killing the livestone or by casting stone to flesh on the livestone. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the livestone and automatically ejects an engulfed victim.  Solidify (Ex) A livestone can solidify all or part of itself into a material with the hardness and consistency of solid rock. A solidified part of a livestone has a hardness of 8 and a break DC of 50. A livestone can effect the solidification as a free action. An opponent attacking a livestone must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save each time his attack hits. If the save is failed, the livestone actually solidifies the portion of its body at the instant it was hit, thus applying its hardness rating of 8 to any damage it takes. A livestone cannot attack if its entire form is solidified. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Lunar Naga	6.00	2400	Large	4	20, touch 14, flat-footed 15	68	6	8	9				40 ft.	bite +7 (2d6+3 plus poison)		10 ft.	5 ft.	hypnosis, sneak attack +3d6	Str 14, Dex 19, Con 18, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 17	6	9	24 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Hypnosis (Su) Once per day, by weaving and coiling its body and hissing as a standard action, a lunar naga can cause its scales to shimmer and glow with moonlike radiance. All creatures within 30 feet who can see the naga must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid becoming fascinated. The lunar naga can maintain this fascination effect as long as it concentrates; fascinated creatures follow the still-glowing naga if it moves as long as it maintains the effect by concentrating. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con and 1 Wis; cure 1 save.

Any creature that grapples a lunarma or attacks it with unarmed strikes or natural weapons takes 1d4 points of damage from the vicious barbs. Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker this way.  Breath Weapon (Su) The acid from a lunarma's breath weapon lasts for 1d4 additional rounds, dealing 2d6 points of acid damage on its turn to any creature that took damage from the breath weapon. Washing off the acid with water or other liquid is a full-round action that ends the continuing damage.  Implant Eggs (Ex) As a full-round action, a lunarma can lay 2d6 eggs in a helpless creature. The eggs hatch after 24 hours and each deals 1 point of Con damage per hour as they feed on the host. After 1d2 days of eating, the larvae crawl out and find a safe place to mature into adults. A remove disease spell rids a creature of all implanted eggs or larvae, or they can be removed one at a time by using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds.																												
Maftet	6.00	2400	Medium	3	20, touch 13, flat-footed 17	68	5	9	8				40 ft., fly 60 ft.

Raptor Dive (Ex) When airborne, a maftet can swoop down and strike at lightning speed. This is equivalent to an aerial charge, but it must move downward at least 10 feet and may dive at twice its normal flying speed. Doing so grants the maftet a +2 bonus on its attack rolls and allows it to make a full attack at the end of the raptor dive.  Runic Tattoos (Su) The tattoos scribed on a maftet's body power its spell-like abilities and glow when those abilities are used. A maftet can activate up to two of its spell-like abilities as a standard action. It may make a Fortitude save to resist the effects of an erase spell cast on its tattoos, but if it fails, it loses access to its spell-like abilities for 24 hours.																												
Magnesium Golem	6.00	2400	Medium	1	18, touch 11, flat-footed 17	64	2	3	2			rust vulnerability	30 ft.	2 slams +10 (2d6+2 plus 1d4 Dexterity damage)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 15, Dex 13, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	8	10	21	Tome of Horrors Complete	Aura of Sickness (Su) As a free action, a magnesium golem can generate an aura in a 10-foot radius spread that sickens all living creatures entering the area for 1d4 minutes if that creature fails a DC 16 Fortitude save. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same magnesium golem's aura of sickness for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Dexterity Damage (Su) A magnesium golem's slam attack deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage to a living foe if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A magnesium golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below. A magic attack that deals water damage or creates water slows a magnesium golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical effect that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A magnesium golem gets no saving throw against fire effects. Rust Vulnerability (Ex) A magnesium golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.																												
Malkeen	6.00	2400	Large	6	16, touch 12, flat-footed 13	76	10	8	4				40 ft.	2 claws +13 (1d6+5), bite +12 (1d8+5)		10 ft.	5 ft.	mind blast, pounce, rake (2 claws +13, 1d6+5)	Str 21, Dex 15, Con 18, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 12	8	14	27 (31 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Mind Blast (Su) As a standard action, a malkeen can deliver a massive blast of mental energy at a single target within 50 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or take 6d6 points of damage. A malkeen can use this ability once every 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Medium Lightning Quasi-elemental	6.00	2400	Medium	6	20, touch 17, flat-footed 13	75	5	13	7			vulnerability to water	fly 60 ft.

A creature striking the lightning quasi-elemental unarmed, or a creature striking the lightning quasi-elemental with a weapon take this same electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. Metallic creatures or creatures using metal weapons take an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. Globe (Ex) As a standard action, a lightning quasi-elemental can discharge one globe of electricity per HD it possesses once per round. Globes hover by the quasi-elemental and move with the creature. An opponent that moves within 5 feet of a lightning quasi-elemental discharges a globe and takes the electricity damage shown on the table below. An affected creature can make a Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. Once a globe discharges, it is destroyed and a lightning quasi-elemental cannot recreate it for 4 hours. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A lightning quasi-elemental takes 1d8 points of damage per gallon of water it contacts. Pouring water onto a lightning quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level to a lightning quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against a lightning quasi-elemental.																												
Megapiranha Swarm	6.00	2400	Tiny	6	17, touch 14, flat-footed 15	76	9	10	4	swarm traits			swim 40 ft.	swarm (2d6 plus bleed and distraction)		10 ft.	0 ft.	bleed (2d6), distraction (DC 17)	Str 12, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2	6	-	-	AP 39	Keen Scent (Ex) A megapiranha swarm can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.

The Melfesh Monster attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if the target fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. Attacks that hit the Melfesh Monster while it has a target enveloped deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.  Poison Cloud (Ex) The Melfesh Monster can exude a cloud of poisonous gas in a 20-foot radius up to 3 times per day. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1d4 hours afterward. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Memory Child	6.00	2400	Small	2	16, touch 13, flat-footed 14	68	8	6	10				30 ft.	touch +9 (1d4 plus thought consumption)		5 ft.	5 ft.	mind flood	Str 10, Dex 14, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 11	8	7	19	Tome of Horrors Complete	Mind Flood (Su) As a standard action and by touching an opponent, a memory child floods the opponent's mind with every single thought the child has ever collected from those that have come into contact with it. This effect overloads the opponent's brain dazing it for 1d6+2 rounds and confusing it for 1 hour (treat as a confusion spell, caster level equals the memory child's Hit Dice). A successful DC 16 Will save negates the stunning effect and reduces the confusion effect to 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.  This ability is always active but can be suppressed or restarted by the memory child as a free action.  Thought Consumption (Su) A memory child can drain an opponent's thoughts and memories by touch. (The opponent retains its memories; the memory child just copies them). By making a successful melee touch attack, a memory child deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage to its opponent. A memory child must consume at least 4 points of Intelligence each day or it suffers the effects of starvation.

Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of acid damage initially and suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls for 3 rounds. The cloud disperses in 1d4 rounds and can be affected by wind. The save DC is Constitution-based. Poison (Ex) Slam-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Mi-Go	6.00	2400	Medium	5	20, touch 16, flat-footed 14	66	10	7	9				30 ft., fly 50 ft.

It gains a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. Bluff and Disguise are always class skills for a mi-go.  Evisceration (Ex) A mi-go's claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing surgical operations upon helpless creatures or those it has grappled. When a mi-go makes a successful grapple check, in addition to any other effects caused by a successful grapple, it deals sneak attack damage to the victim. A creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of ability damage from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs). The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Item Creation (Ex) A mi-go possesses the ability to create strange items that blur the line between magic and technology, given time and resources. This ability allows a mi-go to ignore all of the Item Creation feat requirements and spellcasting requirements for creating a magic item; the resulting item is always mi-go technology. A mi-go can use the Heal skill to craft mi-go technology. When a mi-go uses this ability to craft an item, it must use a larger amount of strange ingredients and expendable resources-this effectively doubles the gp cost to create the item.  Starflight (Su) A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)-provided the mi-go knows the way to its destination.																												
Midnight Peddler	6.00	2400	Medium	5	16, touch 11, flat-footed 15	52	6	6	4				20 ft.	touch +7 (death chill)		5 ft.	5 ft.	death chill	Str 11, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 16, Wis 18, Cha 15	7	+8 (+12 grapple)	24 (32 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Death Chill (Su) The touch of the midnight peddler deals 1d4 negative levels to a living creature. The DC is 15 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Constitution-based. The midnight peddler gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level bestowed.  Divination (Su) The peddler provides advice and answers correctly any one question asked of him by any creature who buys something from his cart. This ability functions similar to a divination spell (caster level 12th).  Plane Shift (Su) The midnight peddler can plane shift (as the spell) to any inner or outer plane as a move action. His cart (and any non-living matter contained therein) shifts with him. This ability otherwise functions as the spell of the same name.

Engulf (Ex) A mihstu can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its body as a standard action. The mihstu attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can slash (with a tentacle) the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its attack roll. It can still use its tentacles to strike at other targets. Attacks that hit an engulfing mihstu deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. Resistance to Missile Attacks (Ex) Ranged attacks (including magic missile) used against a mihstu have a 50% miss chance. Susceptible to Cold (Ex) Cold-based attacks and effects deal no damage to a mihstu, but stun it. If the cold-based effect allows a saving throw and the mihstu succeeds on its save, it ignores the stun effect. If it fails its save, or if the effect doesn't allow a save, the mihstu is stunned for 1d4+2 rounds.

What the proper flow of fate entails is determined by the GM. Typical uses of this ability include casting major image to coax someone to a portentous location, casting raise dead to return someone with an important fate to life, or using rusting grasp to weaken a structure and cause some necessary calamity.  Mind-Warping Gaze (Su) Fear, 30 feet, Will DC 18 negates. A creature that fails a save against this attack becomes shaken for 1d6 rounds. A creature currently suffering from a fear effect that fails this save instead takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Mudball (Ex) A mudlord can throw a ball of sticky mud up to 30 feet at an opponent's face as a ranged touch attack. It if hits, the target is blinded. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save as a free action; if successful, the target shakes off the mud.  The target or an adjacent creature can wipe off the mud as a standard action. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerable to Magic (Ex) A transmute mud to rock spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any mudlord in the area and automatically staggers it for 2d6 rounds.

The mummy golem makes a grapple check. If the mummy golem wins the check, it slips several bandages around the foe's throat and deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage in addition to constriction damage. The bandages can come from anywhere on its body, not just its arm or hand. Therefore, a mummy golem can continue to use its slam attacks, constriction, and strangulation attack against other foes. A Medium mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 4 opponents at one time using this ability. A Large mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 6 opponents at one time using this ability. A mummy golem is not considered grappled while it is strangling an opponent, and can move and attack normally, but it cannot move more than 10 feet away from an opponent while strangling it.

Any living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural feelings of hopelessness. A powerful curse falls upon the victim and they become so despondent that they need to make a successful DC 16 Concentration check in order to motivate themselves enough to make an attack or cast spell. The curse is permanent, though a remove curse or break enchantment (both requiring a successful caster level check against DC 18) or a limited wish, wish, or miracle can remove the effects of curse. The save DC is Charisma-based. Whether or not the save is successful, an individual cannot be affected by a murderborn's despondent wail for the next 24 hours.  Sense Living (Su) A murder-born can detect living creatures to a range of 100 feet. This functions as a detect evil spell (caster level 8th) except it detects the presence of life rather than a particular alignment. There is no chance the murder-born to be stunned and it is not blocked by stone, wood, or any other material.

Skewer (Ex) If a mythic manticore confirms a critical hit with a spike, the spike pins the target to the ground or a nearby surface. If the target is using winged flight, the spike snares its wings. The target is considered grappled by the manticore (though the manticore is not considered to be grappling) and must escape the grapple to move from its square. A flying creature must escape on its turn or plummet to the ground. As a swift action, a mythic manticore can expend one use of mythic power to skewer all targets hit by its spikes that turn, even if the attacks weren't critical hits.  Spikes (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a mythic manticore can loose a volley of four spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only 24 spikes in any 24-hour period.																												
Mythic Minotaur	6.00	2400	Large	0	17, touch 9, flat-footed 17	72	6	5	5	natural cunning	17		30 ft.	mwk greataxe +12/+7 (3d6+7/x3), gore +11 (1d6+2)		10 ft.	10 ft.	mythic power (2/day, surge +1d6), oubliette, powerful charge (gore, 2d6+7)	Str 21, Dex 10, Con 15, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 8	7	+13 (+17 bull rush)	23 (25 vs. bull rush)	Mythic Adventures	Maze Mastery (Su) A mythic minotaur can designate an area no greater than 100 feet on a side (typically a maze, underground labyrinth, or other confusing structure) as its personal lair. As a move action, the minotaur can teleport from one point in its lair to any other point in its lair, as if using greater teleport. In addition, whenever the minotaur must make a saving throw while inside its lair, it can roll twice and take the higher result. A mythic minotaur can change its lair once per week. A minotaur can share its lair with other creatures (including other minotaurs or mythic minotaurs) without interfering with this ability.  Natural Cunning (Ex) Although a mythic minotaur is not especially intelligent, it possesses innate cunning and logical ability. This gives it immunity to maze spells and prevents it from ever becoming lost. Further, it is never caught flat-footed.  Oubliette (Su) Whenever a mythic minotaur hits a creature with its gore attack as part of a powerful charge, the target must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be sent into an extradimensional prison, as the maze spell but lasting for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Wisdom-based and includes a +2 racial modifier.																												
Mythic Troll	6.00	2400	Large	2	18, touch 11, flat-footed 16	79	11	4	3	primal vigor			30 ft.	bite +9 (1d8+6), 2 claws +9 (1d6+6)		10 ft.	10 ft.	feral savagery (rend), mythic power (2/day, surge +1d6), rend (2 claws, 1d6+9 plus bleed 5 plus feral savagery)	Str 23, Dex 14, Con 23, Int 6, Wis 9, Cha 6	4	11	23	Mythic Adventures	Primal Vigor (Su) If a mythic troll takes damage during a round, its regeneration increases by 5 at the start of its next turn, to a maximum of 25. If the troll is at full hit points at the start of its turn, its regeneration decreases by 5, to a minimum of 5. Damaging the troll with acid or fire only partially suppresses its regeneration. On its turn following this damage, the troll regenerates only half the normal number of hit points (for example, a troll with regeneration 15 would heal 7 hit points) and can die normally on that round.																												
Mythic Winter Wolf	6.00	2400	Large	5	19, touch 10, flat-footed 18	77	9	6	3			vulnerable to fire	50 ft.	bite +11 (1d8+9 plus 1d6 bleed and 1d6 cold and trip)		10 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (1d6), breath weapon (15-ft. cone, 6d6 cold and slow for 2 rounds, Reflex DC 17 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), lingering breath (2d6 cold, 2 rounds), mythic power (2/day, surge +1d6)	Str 22, Dex 13, Con 18, Int 9, Wis 13, Cha 10	6	13	24 (28 vs. trip)	Mythic Adventures

As long as it rages it gains +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and -2 AC. This rage lasts up to 1 minute, but the nazalor can end it early if desired. It is not fatigued when its rage ends. While raging, a nazalor has the following changes made to the statistics block above: AC 16 (+3 Dex, +5 natural, -2 rage), touch 11, flat-footed 13; hp 92; Atk 2 claws +15 (1d8+7) and bite +15 (1d8+7); Fort +12; Str 25; Con 22. Stun (Ex) If a nazalor hits an opponent with both claws and its bite in the same round, that opponent must succeed on a DC 18 (DC 20 when raging) Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Mire Blindness tentacle-injury; save DC 17 Fort; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect blindness and 1d3 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. A creature that fails two saving throws is rendered permanently blinded. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a nothosaurus may take an additional move action in that round.																												
Numerian Fluid Scavenger	6.00	2400	Medium	6	16, touch 12, flat-footed 14	56	9	10	2			addicted	30 ft.	mwk longspear +6 (1d8/3)	dart +7 (1d4 plus poison)	5 ft.	5 ft.	bomb 11/day (4d6+4 fire, DC 17)	Str 10, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 18, Wis 8, Cha 12	5	5	17	Numeria Land Of Fallen Stars	Addicted (Ex) The Numerian scavenger is addicted to Numerian fluids (see page 28). She keeps her ability damage and penalties under control with lesser restoration. Roll once on the Numerian Fluids Side Effects table on page 29. If the result indicates a side effect that includes an addiction, the scavenger is addicted to that specific side effect in addition to Numerian fluids in general. Latest Dose (Ex) There is a 50% chance the Numerian fluid scavenger drank her latest dose of fluid 1d4 hours ago and is still under the effects of the drug when encountered. If she has done so, apply the effects of the dose and roll on the Numerian Fluids Side Effects table on page 29. The alchemist uses alchemical allocation to consume her potion of lesser restoration to cure any ability damage she takes from the dose. The scavenger retains the unused dose of fluids in her inventory, even if she has consumed a dose earlier in the day.																												
Numerian Gunslinger	6.00	2400	Medium	5	20, touch 16, flat-footed 15	61	8	9	5	nimble +2			30 ft.	mwk dagger +8/+3 (1d4+1/19-20)	laser pistol +10 touch (1d8+3 fire) or  mwk pistol +10 touch (1d8/x4)	5 ft.	5 ft.	grit (2), gun training (laser pistol, +3)	Str 12, Dex 17, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 8	6	7	23	Numeria Land Of Fallen Stars	Laser Pistol (Ex) The gunslinger's laser pistol is a one-handed firearm that shoots a beam of highly focused light at its target, dealing 1d8 points of fire damage on a successful hit. The gun has a range increment of 50 feet, and its attacks resolve against the target's touch AC.  Lasers can pass through force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Each shot expends 1 charge of the gun's 10-charge capacity.  As a semiautomatic weapon, the gun fires one shot per attack. If the gunslinger wishes, he can fire an additional shot per round as if using the Rapid Shot feat. This additional shot can stack with the additional shot granted by Rapid Shot, but when it does so, it increases the penalty for all shots fired that round to -6. A laser pistol is worth 10,000 gp and weighs 2 pounds.  Numerian Silverdisks (Ex) These small, coin-sized discs are etched with circuitry, and contain 10 charges each. When placed in a special slot in the gunslinger's laser pistol, a silverdisk transfers its charge into the gun's internal capacitors, effectively reloading the weapon. A silverdisk can be recharged (with a 20% chance of being destroyed) with an active generator. A charged silverdisk glows with light equivalent to that of a candle. A Numerian silverdisk is worth 100 gp as long as it is capable of holding a charge; a dead silverdisk is worth 1 gp.  Rare Resources (Ex) The Numerian gunslinger's access to the rare and expensive technology of the land's many metal ruins increases his wealth to that of a PC of her level.  This increases his CR by 1.

The flames can be thrown as a ranged touch attack at a range of 120 feet with no range increment, and deal 3d6 points of cold damage.  Curse of Darkness (Su) With a touch, an owb can make bright light unbearable to the victim. Any creature touched must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or gain the light blindness weakness. This ability also robs the victim of its coloration, leaving the creature and its equipment in washed-out shades of gray. This effect can be removed with break enchantment or remove curse, unless the target has the dark folk subtype, in which case the effect can only be removed by wish or similar magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Petrified Maiden	6.00	2400	Medium	5	21, touch 11, flat-footed 20	67	6	4	6	channel resistance +2, petrified body, reconstitution	17		30 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 18, Dex 12, Con -, Int 9, Wis 11, Cha 16	6	10	21 (cannot be disarmed)	Inner Sea Bestiary	Curse of Stone (Su) Curse-touch; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Dex. A creature afflicted by the curse of stone slowly turns to stone, its skin turning an ashen gray and hardening into a stony texture. For every 3 points of Dexterity damage taken, the victim gains a +1 natural armor bonus. The curse of stone can only be cured by removing the curse followed by a stone to flesh spell to undo the damage it has done. If the curse is not removed first, stone to flesh only restores 1d3 points of Dexterity, though these can be lost again as the curse continues to spread. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Petrified Body (Ex) The stony flesh of a petrified maiden reacts to certain spells and effects as noted below.  • A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a petrified maiden, with no saving throw.  • Transmute mud to rock immediately heals any and all damage taken by a petrified maiden.  • A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the petrified maiden's structure, but negates its damage reduction and spell resistance for 1 round.  Reconstitution (Su) As long as Geb's original curse that first afflicted the petrified maidens remains unbroken, any petrified maiden (animate or not) that is damaged or destroyed slowly returns to its undamaged form, even if parts of it were utterly destroyed or carried away. For a relatively undamaged petrified maiden, this slow process can be completed in a week or so. For a petrified maiden reduced to rubble, it might take years. If a petrified maiden is destroyed while under the effects of a stone to flesh spell, it cannot reconstitute and is permanently destroyed.  Weapon Expertise (Ex) A petrified maiden is proficient with any one martial weapon. It gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with this weapon.

Therefore, it does not need to make the checks normally associated with riding another creature.																												
Possession Lesser	6.00	2400	Medium	3	17, touch 17, flat-footed 13	59	8	10	7	incorporeal	17	sunlight weakness	30 ft., fly 30 ft. (perfect)	2 claws +10 touch (1d4+3), bite +10 touch (1d6+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	dread, malevolence	Str -, Dex 16, Con 16, Int 15, Wis 17, Cha 17	7	10	24	AP 29	Claws (Su) A gidim's natural attacks inflict real wounds when they rake against physical objects they strike. A gidim's natural weapon damage is modified by its Charisma bonus. Dread (Su) Gidims are adept at using their spell-like abilities to terrifying effect. At will, and while remaining invisible, a gidim can choose to make any of the spell-like abilities noted in its stat block particularly frightening. Any creature that witnesses and is within 10 feet of the effect of one of these spell-like abilities must make a saving throw or be shaken for 1 minute. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Malevolence (Su) Once per day, a gidim on the Material Plane can merge its body with another creature's. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (CL 10th or the devil's HD, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the devil must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 16 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same devil's malevolence for 24 hours. While using this ability, the gidim is not affected by its otherworldly ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. Nourished by Negativity (Su) Gidims seek out volatile mortals to aid them in entering the Material Plane. At the most basic level, negative emotions occur when a creature is dying, raging, or subject to a fear effect. At the GM's discretion, negative emotions might also include non-rules-related effects, such as extreme feelings of anger, betrayal, frustration, hate, or sorrow. Anytime a gidim witnesses a creature affected by negative emotions, it may choose to gain a +1 bonus on its next Will save made to enter the Material Plane, so long as it attempts to enter the plane within 30 feet of that creature and within 24 hours. If within 12 to 24 hours of gaining this bonus the gidim witness the same creature again being affected by negative emotions, it gains an additional +1 bonus on its Will save which stacks with the original and increases the duration of the bonus by an additional 24 hours. Thus, a gidim may gain a stacking +1 bonus to its Will save in this manner once every 12 hours. The devil loses its entire accumulated bonus if it attempts and fails to enter the Material Plane, if 24 hours pass without it witnessing its target creature being affected by negative emotions, or if it takes a bonus from another creature affected by negative emotions. Once on the Material Plane, this bonus applies to a gidim's Will saves made to resist being expelled from the plane. The bonus decreases by 1 every minute until it reaches 0. A gidim that leaves the Material Plane before this bonus reaches 0 retains any remaining bonus. Otherworldly (Ex) Gidims find it difficult to enter the Material Plane. To do so by any means, a lesser possession devil must make a DC 30 Will save, failure meaning it is barred from entry and cannot access the plane again for 12 hours. In addition, after every minute of being on the Material Plane, the devil must make a DC 30 Will save or be expelled, returning to the plane it traveled from. Additionally, as a free action a number of times per day equal to the gidim's Charisma modifier, the devil can empower one of its spell-like abilities to extend out from the Ethereal Plane and affect a target on the Material Plane. Sunlight Weakness (Ex) Gidims' powers are weakened in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), reducing the DCs of their special abilities by -4. In addition, gidims attempting to enter the Material Plane into an area of sunlight take a -4 penalty on their Will save.

A successful DC 17 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Heat (Ex) Touching or being touched by a queen thermite automatically deals 2d6 points of fire damage.  Fire Sense (Ex) A queen thermite notices and locates any fire source equal to a torch or greater within 200 feet. It also senses the intensity of the flame.

However, humanoids with 6 or more Hit Dice and the rage class feature instead become ragewights, retaining the rage powers they had in life. Such spawn are under the command of their creator until its death, at which point they become free-willed undead.  Savage Fury (Ex) A ragewight can trigger a savage fury as a free action. It can use this fury for 24 rounds each day. These rounds don't need to be consecutive. The ragewight gains a +6 profane bonus to its Strength and Charisma and a +3 profane bonus on Will saves when using this fury. When a ragewight ends its fury, it is staggered for 1d4 rounds and can't resume its fury during this time. This ability otherwise functions as the greater rage barbarian class feature, treating the ragewight's racial Hit Dice as its barbarian level for the purposes of rage and any rage powers.																												
Redcap	6.00	2400	Small	8	20, touch 15, flat-footed 16	60	6	10	3			irreligious	60 ft.	Medium scythe +10 (2d4+10/x4), kick +4 (1d4+6)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 18, Dex 19, Con 18, Int 16, Wis 13, Cha 15	4	-5	9	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Boot Stomp (Ex) A redcap wears heavy iron boots with spiked soles that it uses to deadly effect in combat. These boots give the redcap a kick attack that it can make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full-attack action or as part of its movement just as if it had the Spring Attack feat.  Heavy Weapons (Ex) A redcap can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty.  Irreligious (Ex) Bitter and blasphemous, redcaps cannot stand the symbols of good-aligned religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a holy symbol, any redcap that can see the creature must make a DC 15 Will save or become frightened for 1 minute and attempt to flee.  A redcap who successfully saves is shaken for 1 minute.  Red Cap (Su) A redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a redcap gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls (included in the above totals) and fast healing 3. These benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. Caps are not transferable, even between redcaps. A redcap can create a new cap to replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of work, although until the redcap takes a standard action to dip the cap in the blood of a foe the redcap helped to kill, the cap does not grant its bonuses.

The renzer can communicate with any creature it currently commands as if by speak with animals.																												
Revenant	6.00	2400	Medium	7	19, touch 13, flat-footed 16	76	7	6	7		17	self-loathing	30 ft.	2 claws +14 (1d8+7 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	baleful shriek, constrict (1d6+7)	Str 24, Dex 17, Con -, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 19	6	+13 (+17 grapple)	26	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Baleful Shriek (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a revenant can shriek as a standard action. All creatures within a 60-foot spread must make a DC 18 Will save or cower in fear for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Reason to Hate (Su) A revenant's existence is fueled by its hatred for its murderer. As long as the murderer exists, the revenant exists. If the murderer dies, the revenant is immediately slain. A murderer who becomes undead does not trigger a revenant's destruction. When a revenant encounters its murderer, it gains the benefits of a haste spell (CL 20th) that lasts as long as its murderer remains in sight. Against its murderer, the revenant also gains a +4 profane bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, grapple checks, and saving throws.  Self-Loathing (Ex) When confronted with its reflection or any object that was important to it in life, a revenant must make a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming overwhelmed with self-pity. This condition renders the revenant helpless, and lasts until the revenant is attacked or sees its murderer. If a revenant resists becoming overwhelmed, the revenant becomes obsessed with the source that triggered the saving throw and does everything it can to destroy it, reacting to the trigger as if the trigger were its murderer and gaining bonuses from its reason to hate ability.  Sense Murderer (Su) A revenant knows the direction but not the distance to its murderer-this sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks scrying. Against its murderer, a revenant has true seeing and discern lies in effect at all times (CL 20th); these abilities cannot be dispelled.																												
Rhu-Chalik	6.00	2400	Small	7	18, touch 14, flat-footed 15	68	6	5	8	all-around vision			5 ft., fly 60 ft. (perfect)	4 tendrils +10 (1d4+1 plus pain touch)		5 ft.	5 ft.	pain touch, project terror, void transmission	Str 12, Dex 16, Con 19, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 15	6	6	19	AP 86	Pain Touch (Ex) A rhu-chalik secretes an enzyme that coats its tendrils. When this enzyme comes into contact with a living creature, it causes excruciating pain. Any creature that comes into contact with the enzyme must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks for 1d4 rounds. If a creature is affected by multiple pain touch attacks, the duration stacks but the penalty doesn't. Creatures that are immune to pain effects are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Project Terror (Su) As a standard action, a rhu-chalik can harness the fears of any creature it has successfully used detect thoughts on within the last minute. This effect creates visions of that creature's most terrible nightmares in the target's mind; the target must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be frightened and take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Void Transmission (Su) If a creature takes an amount of Wisdom damage from the rhu-chalik's project terror ability that equals or exceeds the creature's Wisdom score, the creature falls unconscious as normal. At that point, the rhu-chalik can take 10 minutes to copy and absorb the creature's entire consciousness and send that consciousness through the void of space to its waiting masters. If the creature's Wisdom damage is healed and the creature is revived prior to the end of this process, this effect fails. If the creature's Wisdom damage is healed after its consciousness is successfully transmitted, the creature awakes disoriented, and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks for 24 hours. This effect otherwise doesn't harm the target, as the target's consciousness isn't eliminated, only duplicated and transmitted.

A stone to flesh spell (or similar effect) restores a petrified rock troll, but if it remains exposed to sunlight, it must immediately start making new Fortitude saves to avoid petrification. Spells like sunray or sunburst that create powerful natural sunlight cannot petrify a rock troll, but the troll is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being exposed to such an effect.

Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex) A rock troll exposed to sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) can only take a single move or attack action and is instantly turned to stone (as if by a flesh to stone spell) in the next round if its fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. This effect is permanent, but can be dispelled if the rock troll is removed from the source of the sunlight and stone to flesh is cast on it. A rock troll must make a new saving throw each round it remains in sunlight.

Every round that part of a rorkoun's space does not occupy the same square as a significant body of water (50 gallons or more), the creature takes damage equal to the number of rounds it has been outside water. The rorkoun stops taking damage as soon as it reenters the water. Gob (Ex) A rorkoun can spit a wad of viscous slaver at its prey. As a standard action, the rorkoun can make a ranged touch attack at a single creature up to 30 feet away. Creatures of Large size or smaller that are struck by the attack must succeed on a DC 18 Reflex save or become entangled. Flying creatures that fail their Reflex save fall to the ground. An entangled creature can escape by making a DC 18 Escape Artist or Strength check. Should an entangled target take any amount of acid damage, the sticky saliva is instantly dissolved. The save, skill, and ability check DCs are Constitution-based. Squeeze (Ex) Able to manipulate the shape of its highly malleable body, a rorkoun can easily slip through spaces not normally accessible to a creature of its size. For the purposes of determining how small a space a rorkoun can squeeze through, treat it as one size category smaller. A rorkoun can move into even smaller spaces by contracting, allowing it to treat its size as two size categories smaller.

A creature attempting to cast a cure spell or heal spell on a creature damaged by the sabrewing's wing slash must make a successful caster level check (DC 18), or the spell has no effect on the injured character. The check DC is Constitution-based.  See Invisible (Sp) A sabrewing can see invisible creatures as if using the see invisibility spell.  This ability is always active. It can be negated, but the sabrewing can restart it as a free action on its next turn.

This attack has a range of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (DC 17 Reflex half) to the primary target. After it strikes, the ball lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to the sea drake's Hit Dice (usually 7) within 20 feet of the primary target. The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt. Once a sea drake has used its ball lightning breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.  Capsize (Ex) A sea drake can attempt to capsize a boat or ship of its size or smaller by ramming it as a charge attack and making a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.

The save DC is Charisma-based.  Confusion Command (Su) As an immediate action, a seugathi can issue a telepathic command to a confused creature within 30 feet. This allows the seugathi to pick a result from the confusion behavior table, rather than the confused creature rolling randomly for its actions that round.

A spartolos flanking a target with another spartolos gains a +4 flanking bonus instead of +2. Disjoin (Su) As a move action, a spartolos can crumble into a pile of bones and tarnished weaponry. While in this state, the undead gains a +8 racial bonus to its Stealth check and its DR rises to 10/bludgeoning. As a move action, a spartolos can reform itself, jolting into its armored skeletal form even if its pieces have been scattered. United Resistance (Su) A spartolos ignores 5 points of damage caused by channel energy. This resistance rises by 5 for every other spartolos within 10 feet to a minimum of 0 damage.

Any creature subjected to a stirge's blood drain attack has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, "Diseases"). Once this check is made, the victim can no longer be infected by this particular stirge, though attacks by different stirges are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses.

Strands (Ex) Most encounters with a stone roper begin when it fires up to six strong, sticky strands up to 50 feet away (no range increment). A roper's attacks with its strands are treated as ranged touch attacks. Strands can be severed by any amount of slashing damage (a strand is AC 20). Once a strand has successfully struck a victim, it remains attached until severed or retracted by the stone roper (which it may do as a free action). Attached strands do no further Strength damage, but the struck individual is subject to the pull effect each round, and is subject to the stone roper's venom pulse ability.  A creature that begins its turn attached to a strand is numbed and weakened by the strange material, and for each strand attached must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based, and poison resistances and immunities apply.  Venom Pulse (Ex) Twice per day, a stone roper can exude a pulse of venom through all of its attached strands as a free action. A creature attached to a strand must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed (multiple attached strands to not require multiple saves or increase the save DC). A paralyzed creature appears to have been turned to stone (DC 20 Spot check or close inspection reveals that this is in fact not the case). One round after being paralyzed, the victim recovers and must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or act as if under the effects of a charm monster spell for 2d4 minutes. A charmed creature fights for and defends the stone roper. If the stone roper is killed, a charmed victim acts as if under the effects of a confusion spell for 1d6+2 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based, and poison resistances and immunities apply.

While in an area of normal or brighter light, anyone who occupies the same square as a stymphalides swarm at the beginning of its turn must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. Those who fail are blinded for 1d4 rounds, while those who make their saves are dazzled until they spend 1 full round outside the swarm's space.

Transformation Ritual (Su) A swan maiden can transform a willing good female humanoid into a swan maiden via a ritual that takes 24 hours. The humanoid loses her class and racial abilities.

Str 12, Dex 12, Con -, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 15	6	7	18	Tome of Horrors 4	Sword Channel (Ex) A sword wight's energy drain ability functions through melee weapon attacks it makes, in addition to its slam attacks.																												
Tear of Nuruu'gal	6.00	2400	Small	-5	6, touch 6, flat-footed 6	62	8	-4	1		17	vulnerability to cold	10 ft., climb 10 ft.	slam +7 (1d6+3 plus burn and grab)	ranged touch -1 (by spell)	5 ft.	5 ft.	burn (1d6, DC 19), constrict (1d6+3), symbiosis	Str 14, Dex 1, Con 24, Int 4, Wis 5, Cha 1	3	4	18	Lost Cities Of Golarion	Symbiosis (Ex) As part of a constrict attack, a tear of Nuruu'gal can attempt to forcefully inhabit a humanoid victim's body.  A DC 21 Fortitude save resists this intrusion and renders immunity to that ooze's symbiosis ability for 24 hours; failure means the ooze spends a full-round action inhabiting its new host. Once absorbed, the ooze grants incredible boons to willing hosts, or slowly incinerates unwilling victims. A willing host ceases aging, is sustained as if wearing a ring of sustenance, and becomes sterile.  He or she also gains the fire subtype, spell resistance, and telepathic abilities of the tear of Nuruu'gal. A host can use the creature's spell-like abilities, with save DCs calculated using the host's Hit Dice and Charisma score, although daily limits of powers still apply. Damage dealt to the host body does not harm the ooze.  Unwilling victims are granted no abilities, and are instead tortured with searing pain. Victims take automatic burn damage each round, and must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. While this occurs, the ooze may telepathically appeal to the host for control of the body to prevent further pain (treat control as magic jar, with no receptacle required). The ooze may vacate the body of a host as a full-round action, bursting forth in a protoplasmic expulsion, dealing double burn damage.  A victim may attempt to expel the creature from his or her body as a full-round action with a DC 21 Fortitude save, but each attempt results in automatic burn damage from the ooze, and damage from the creature's violent exit if successful (as if the ooze had left voluntarily). Remove curse expels the creature, if the caster succeeds on a DC 21 caster level check.  The save DCs are Constitution-based.																												
Tekenu	6.00	2400	Small	8	16, touch 16, flat-footed 11	65	5	7	17	odd anatomy		vulnerable to channeled energy	10 ft., fly 30 ft. (poor)	2 slams +12 (2d6)		5 ft.	5 ft.	canopic consumption, distraction (DC 18)	Str 11, Dex 19, Con -, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 15	7	24	38 (42 vs. trip)	AP 80	Canopic Consumption (Su) As a full-round action, a tekenu can consume a single organ from the body of a helpless or recently dead humanoid or monstrous humanoid. This organ must either be magically preserved or come from a creature that is alive or has been dead no longer than 3 days. Only one organ may be harvested from each body; all others are destroyed in the process as the tekenu rips the body apart. Each organ consumed grants the tekenu a unique ability listed below. When discovered, a tekenu typically has 1d4 of the following abilities, each corresponding to the most recent organs the creature absorbed. Even when the creature has absorbed all four organs (thus gaining a full suite of abilities), it still hungers for more. The challenge rating of a tekenu that possesses all four canopic organs increases by 1.  Intestines: The tekenu gains the grab ability when using its slam attacks. A tekenu can grapple Medium or smaller creatures with this attack, and it gains a +2 racial bonus on its CMB and to its CMD. In addition, the tekenu gains the constrict ability, dealing 2d6 points of damage.  Liver: The tekenu's slam attacks deal 1d3 points of Constitution damage to any living creature that fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Lungs: As a standard action, the tekenu can expel most of the air and moisture from its form, turning into a pile of desiccated viscera. While in this form, the tekenu gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks, and its fly speed increases to 60 feet with good maneuverability. It can revert to its normal form as a free action.  Stomach: The tekenu deals an additional 1d6 points of acid damage with its slam attacks.  Odd Anatomy (Ex) As a collection of various individual organs and flesh, a tekenu is in many ways similar to a swarm. The creature is not subject to critical hits or flanking, and it is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate).  Vulnerable to Channeled Energy (Ex) A tekenu takes 150% as much damage as normal from channeled positive energy.																												
Temporal Crawler	6.00	2400	Medium	8	17, touch 15, flat-footed 17	45	7	9	4	foresight			40 ft., climb 20ft.	bite +8 (1d6+3 plus paralysis)		5 ft.	5 ft.	paralysis (1d4+4 rounds DC 14), slowing webs	Str 15, Dex 19, Con 15, Int 6, Wis 13, Cha 10	6	+15 (+19 grapple)	24 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Slowing Webs (Ex) The web of a temporal crawler emanates a slow effect (as the slow spell, caster level 6th) that affects all creatures within 10 feet of the web.  Affected creatures can make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save the round they are affected to negate the effects.  Creatures are slowed as long as they stay within 10 feet of a web. The slow effects can be counterspelled with the successful casting of a haste spell if the caster makes a successful caster level check (DC 16) before casting the haste spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A temporal crawler can fire a web up to four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the temporal crawler.  An entangled creature can attempt a DC 19 Escape Artist check or burst it with a DC 19 Strength check. Both are standard actions. The check DCs are both Constitution-based and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus.  Temporal crawlers often create sticky sheets of webbing up to 20 feet square. Approaching creatures must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 10 hit points, and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/ magic.  Foresight (Su) A temporal crawler can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents a temporal crawler from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the temporal crawler an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the temporal crawler can restart it as a free action on its next turn.  Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Temporal crawlers are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like).																												
Tendriculos	6.00	2400	Huge	3	19, touch 7, flat-footed 19	76	10	4	9				20 ft.	bite +11 (2d6+7 plus grab), 2 tentacles +6 (1d6+3 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	paralysis (3d6 rounds, DC 18), swallow whole (2d6 acid damage plus paralysis, AC 15, 7 hp)	Str 24, Dex 9, Con 18, Int 3, Wis 8, Cha 3	6	+12 (+16 grapple)	24	PFRPG Bestiary 2

This effect persists until the end of the battle.  Rank Fighting (Ex) Whenever a terra-cotta soldier is adjacent to another terra-cotta soldier, it gains a +2 dodge bonus to its AC and a +2 bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls.																												
Thriae Dancer	6.00	2400	Medium	7	19, touch 13, flat-footed 16	60	6	9	21				30 ft., fly 60 ft. (good)	mwk glaive +12/+7 (1d10+3/x3), sting +10 (1d8+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	inspiring dance, poison	Str 15, Dex 16, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 16	8	36	46	AP 81	Inspiring Dance (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a thriae dancer can consume a dose of merope (honey from the thriae queen) to channel her connection to the natural world into an awe-inspiring dance. This dance may have a variety of effects depending on which of the following performances she chooses. Once she has begun, the thriae dancer may maintain her dance as a free action, and the effects of the dance persist as long as the thriae performs her dance. A thriae dancer can dance for a number of rounds equal to her Hit Dice before becoming fatigued. After that, if she continues dancing for that same number of rounds, she becomes exhausted. A thriae dancer may switch between performances as a swift action. Targets must be within 60 feet and able to see the thriae dancer in order to be affected by her dance. This is a mind-affecting effect.  Dance of Fervor: This performance affects all non-thriae creatures within its range with the effects of both confusion and rage (Will DC 17 negates). When this effect ends, affected creatures are fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the length of time they were affected by the dance of fervor. A creature may not be affected by the same thriae dancer's dance of fervor more than once in 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Dance of Grace: This performance grants all thriae within its range (including the dancer) a +1 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 if three or more thriae dancers are performing a dance of grace within range of the target.  Dance of Passion: This performance grants all thriae within its range (including the dancer) a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 if three or more thriae dancers are performing a dance of passion within range of the target.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Str; cure 1 save.																												
Trench Zombie	6.00	2400	Medium	8	18, touch 15, flat-footed 13	43	4	6	2	bravery +2 channel resistance +4			30 ft.	socket bayonet +9/+4 (1d6+3) or   slam +9 (1d6+4)	Mosin-Nagant M1891 rifle +12/+7 (1d10+6/x4) or   M1914 concussion grenade +10 (3d6)	5 ft.	5 ft.	trench warfare (rifle), weapon training (firearms +1)	Str 17, Dex 18, Con -, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8	6	2	14	AP 71	Trench Warfare (Ex)  Starting at 3rd level, a trench fighter can select one specific type of firearm (such as a machine gun, revolver, or rif le). He gains a bonus equal to his Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), the trench fighter picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well. Furthermore, when behind partial, normal, or improved cover, a trench fighter gains an additional +2 AC bonus from the cover. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.   Symbiote (Ex) A unique relationship with trench mists grants trench zombies immunity to acid. In addition, when a trench zombie reaches 0 hit points and is destroyed, the mustard-colored mist that animates the creature bursts violently from its damaged form. All creatures adjacent to the trench zombie are exposed to the toxic gas and take 4d6 points of acid damage. If the trench zombie is enveloped within the fog of its parent trench mist when this death burst occurs, the mist's fast healing ability increases by 1 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the destroyed trench zombie. The effects of the deaths of multiple symbiotic trench zombies stack.																												
Tribal Totem	6.00	2400	Medium	2	19, touch 12, flat-footed 17	69	3	5	1			ceremonial activation, vulnerable to fire	20 ft.	2 slams +12 (1d10+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	spirit link	Str 17, Dex 14, Con -, Int -, Wis 13, Cha 14	9	3	13 (can't be tripped or bull rushed)	AP 39	Ceremonial Activation (Su) A tribal totem stands inert unless empowered each day by spiritual energy. This activation requires that at least 10 participants perform an hour-long ceremony of chanting and adoration. For each hour this ritual lasts, the totem remains alert and functional for 1 day.  The worshipers need not include the creator or possess any special divine powers.  Effigy (Su) As a full-round action once per day, a tribal totem can mimic the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid within its line of sight, reforming itself into a wooden depiction of that creature. Upon doing so, the target can be affected by the effigy ability. While in this shape, the tribal totem knows the location of its target as if persistently using the spell locate creature. A warp wood or wood shape spell immediately forces the tribal totem to revert to its normal form. Although the tribal totem may only use this ability once per day, it can retain a shape indefinitely.  Mouthpiece (Sp) Although a tribal totem cannot speak on its own, every day it can store a single message for its creator and repeat that message upon a prescribed condition. This ability functions as the magic mouth spell, and its creator may change or reset the conditions of the message each day.  Spirit Link (Su) As a standard action, a tribal totem may attempt to join its animating energies with a creature within its line of sight that also shares its likeness (as per the effigy ability).  The target can resist this effect with a DC 16 Will save. If this save fails, the target is affected as if it had cast the spell shield other, taking half the damage inflicted upon the tribal totem.  In addition, any spell with a range of "creature touched" cast upon the tribal totem affects the linked creature rather than the construct. If the spell allows a saving throw, the linked creature can make a saving throw as normal to resist the effect. Spirit link lasts for 4 hours and ends immediately if the tribal totem no longer possesses the target's shape. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Turtle-shark	6.00	2400	Huge	3	21, touch 11, flat-footed 18	63	10	8	2	shell			10 ft., swim 40 ft.	bite +13 (2d6+8 plus grab), slam +12 (1d8+8)		15 ft.	10 ft.	capsize, swallow whole (1d8+8 plus 1d6 acid damage, AC 15, 6 hp)	Str 26, Dex 16, Con 21, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 8	6	+16 (+20 grapple)	29	Tome of Horrors Complete	Capsize (Ex) A turtle-shark can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the turtle-shark's size, it takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.  Shell (Ex) If severely threatened, a turtle-shark can completely withdraw into its shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When withdrawn, a turtle-shark gains a +8 bonus to its Armor Class and a +4 bonus on Reflex saves.																												
Ubashki Lynx	6.00	2400	Large	7	17, touch 12, flat-footed 14	60	4	7	7			vulnerable to fire	30 ft.	bite +11 (2d6+5 plus ubashki rot), 2 claws +10 (1d8+5)		10 ft.	10 ft.	piercing howl, rake (2 claws +10, 1d8+5)	Str 21, Dex 17, Con -, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 15	6	12	25 (29 vs. trip)	Lost Kingdoms	Piercing Howl (Su) When an ubashki lynx howls, all creatures except other undead within a 300-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become frightened for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same ubashki lynx's piercing howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Ubashki Rot (Su) Curse and disease-bite; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 hour; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Str and 1d6 Wis; cure -. Ubashki rot is both a curse and a disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element of ubashki rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted creature must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Undead Mimic	6.00	2400	Medium	5	17, touch 11, flat-footed 16	59	5	5	7				10 ft.	slam +11 (1d8+7 plus adhesive)		5 ft.	5 ft.	constrict (1d8+7), soul drain, weeping discharge	Str 21, Dex 12, Con -, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 16	5	10	21 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Adhesive (Ex) An undead mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered undead mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the undead mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated undead mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 18 Reflex save. A successful DC 18 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive, but the undead mimic can still grapple normally. An undead mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature is destroyed. The save DC is Strength-based.  Mimic Object (Ex) An undead mimic can assume the general shape of any Medium object, such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. An undead mimic's body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. An undead mimic gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks when imitating an object in this manner. Disguise is always a class skill for an undead mimic.  Soul Drain (Su) An undead mimic can take a move action to devour the soul of an adjacent creature it has recently (within the last hour) killed. A creature whose soul is drained cannot be restored to life until the undead mimic containing its soul is destroyed. Each time an undead mimic drains a soul it gains 1d8 temporary hit points and gains a +2 bonus to Strength for 1 hour. These bonuses stack with themselves. After 24 hours, the soul is completely devoured, and the deceased creature cannot be brought back to life via raise dead (resurrection and more powerful effects work normally though the undead mimic must still be destroyed before this magic works).  Weeping Discharge (Ex) An undead mimic constantly leaks and oozes its foul adhesive in a 20-foot-radius area around its body. The area quickly becomes coated in the fluids and is considered difficult terrain. Undead mimics are not hampered by this secretion (their own or that of another undead mimic). The slimy coating lasts for 1 hour before becoming inert.																												
Undead Ooze	6.00	2400	Huge	-5	3, touch 3, flat-footed 3	27	2	-3	6				20 ft., climb 20 ft.	slam +3 (2d4+1 plus 1d6 cold)		15 ft.	10 ft.	cold, engulf (DC 15, 1d6 cold), skeletons	Str 12, Dex 1, Con -, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 10	4	7	12 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Engulf (Ex) The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.  Skeletons (Su) As a full-round action, an undead ooze can expel 1d6 skeletons from its mass. Skeletons can act in the round they are expelled, and each skeleton conforms to the basic statistics for its size (see the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). Slain skeletons are engulfed by the undead ooze and can be reanimated and expelled again in 1d2 hours. An undead ooze's form holds up to 10 skeletons. These skeletons are included in the determination of the undead ooze's CR.																												
Undead Troll	6.00	2400	Large	2	19, touch 11, flat-footed 17	68	5	4	7				40 ft.	bite +12 (1d8+7), 2 claws +12 (1d6+7 plus bleed)		10 ft.	10 ft.	bleed (1d6), rend (2 claws, 1d6+10)	Str 24, Dex 14, Con -, Int 6, Wis 9, Cha 16	6	14	26	Tome of Horrors 4

As a standard action, a chief vegepygmy can release a cloud of spores in a 40-foot spread. A living creature caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. After the paralysis wears off, the character must succeed on another DC 17 Fortitude save or take 3d6 points of Constitution damage. This save DC is Constitution-based. At Constitution 0 a creature dies, and rises as a 4 HD vegepygmy bodyguard in one day. If a remove disease spell is cast on a paralyzed victim before the paralysis wears off, he does not have to attempt the second Fortitude save and takes no Constitution damage.																												
Verdurous Ooze	6.00	2400	Medium	-5	5, touch 5, flat-footed 5	85	9	-2	-2	split			20 ft.	slam +9 (1d6+4 plus 1d6 acid and grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	acid, constrict (1d6+4 plus 1d6 acid), enliven	Str 16, Dex 1, Con 22, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	6	+9 (+13 grapple)	14 (can't be tripped)	AP 35	Acid (Ex) A verdurous ooze secretes a digestive acid that dissolves flesh and metal quickly. Each time a creature takes damage from a verdurous ooze's acid, the creature's metal equipment and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 21 Reflex save prevents damage to such items. A metal or natural weapon that strikes a verdurous ooze takes 1d6 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a verdurous ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 20 points of acid damage (no save) on the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based. Enliven (Sp) The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze cause nearby plants to twitch into life. While in areas covered in natural growth, all squares within 15 feet of the verdurous ooze are affected as if by the spell entangle. The verdurous ooze has no control over this effect, and if dispelled the effect renews after 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Sleep Aura (Su) The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze have a stronger and opposite effect on living, non-plant creatures that come within a 30-foot radius. All living creatures within the area must make a DC 21 Will save or fall asleep for a number of rounds equal to the ooze's HD. Creatures immune to poison are also immune to this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same verdurous ooze's sleep aura for 24 hours. This is a nonmagical sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a verdurous ooze. Instead, if the verdurous ooze would have taken 10 or more points of damage from a single slashing or piercing attack, it splits into two identical oozes, each with half of the original's current hit points (round down). Slashing or piercing attacks that deal less than 10 points of damage do not cause a verdurous ooze to split. Damage from multiple slashing or piercing attacks is not cumulative. A verdurous ooze with 15 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.

Slow Breath (Su) Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

Any creature entering this area must make a Will save (DC 16) to resist the effect. A creature that makes its save is immune to that vulpinal's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
White Pudding	6.00	2400	Huge	-5	3, touch 3, flat-footed 3	94	8	-2	-2	split (piercing and slashing, 10 hp)			20 ft., climb 20 ft.	slam +7 (2d6+4 plus 2d6 acid plus grab)		15 ft.	10 ft.	constrict (2d6+4 plus 2d6 acid), corrosion	Str 17, Dex 1, Con 21, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	6	+11 (+15 grapple)	16 (26 vs. bull rush, can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Acid (Ex) A white pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material quickly, but does not affect metal or stone. Any melee hit or constriction attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's clothing and armor (non-metal only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 19 Reflex saves. A wooden weapon that strikes a white pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless it succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. If a white pudding remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 19 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Camouflage (Ex) Since a white pudding looks like normal ice and snow when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the white pudding. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice a subterranean-dwelling white pudding.  Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by a white pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.  Suction (Ex) The white pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A white pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a white pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) Will-o'-wisps are immune to all spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except magic missile and maze. Natural Invisibility (Ex) Will-o'-wisps have the ability to extinguish their natural glow as a move action, effectively becoming invisible, as per the spell.

This absorbs the missile and manifests as a glowing nimbus around that hand (which is no longer considered free). The energy lasts 6 rounds or until it is used to create a force bolt. To use this ability, the witchwyrd must be aware of the incoming magic missile and cannot be flat-footed.  Force Bolt (Su) A witchwyrd can "throw" a magic missile (1d4+1 damage) from each free hand as a free action (maximum of two per round). If it has absorbed a magic missile, it can throw an additional force bolt that round, expending the absorbed energy (maximum of two additional bolts per round).

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • Warp wood or wood shape slows a wood golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save).  • Repel wood drives the golem back 60 feet and deals 2d12 points of damage to it (no save).  • A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.  If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A wood golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal cold damage.  Splintering (Su) As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, a wood golem can launch a barrage of razor-sharp wooden splinters from its body in a 20-foot-radius burst.  All creatures caught within this area take 6d6 points of slashing damage (Reflex DC 14 halves). The save DC is Constitution-based.

This functions similar to the audible version of the alarm spell and can be heard to a range of 100 feet.

A xill's eggs hatch in 24 hours, at which point the young consume the host from within, inflicting 1 point of Con damage per hour per young until the host dies. The young then emerge and planewalk to the Ethereal Plane, if possible, to mature. A remove disease spell (or similar effect) rids a victim of all implanted eggs or active young, or they can be cut out one at a time with DC 20 Heal checks (each attempt takes 10 minutes). If a check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient. Multiweapon Mastery (Ex) A xill never takes penalties to an attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons, and treats claws as primary attacks even when also wielding weapons. Planewalk (Su) A xill can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a move action. Shifting from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane takes 2 consecutive full-round actions, during which time the xill is immobile. As a xill fades away, it becomes harder to hit: opponents have a 20% miss chance in the first round and a 50% miss chance in the second. A xill can take a single willing or helpless creature with it when it switches planes.

A xorn cannot be flanked.  Earth Glide (Ex) A xorn can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves no sign of its passage nor hint at its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a xorn moves the xorn back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

This penalty remains until the affected creature takes any amount of magical healing or is healed with a successful DC 20 Heal check. The save DC is Strength-based.  Hallucinatory Aura (Su) Any creature coming within 20 feet of a yaenit must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or succumb to the demon's foul, mind-warping magic. A creature affected by a yaenit's hallucinatory aura takes a -2 penalty on Will saves, caster level checks, Intelligence-based skill checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks for as long as it remains within the aura's range and 1d4-1 rounds after leaving the area of effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save was successful, an affected creature is immune to the same yaenit's hallucinatory aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Ray Reflection (Ex) An ancient crystal dragon's scales reflect ray spells back upon the ray's source if the ray fails to overcome the dragon's spell resistance.  Scintillating Aura (Su) A great wyrm crystal dragon radiates an aura of scintillating color from its jeweled scales to a radius of 60 feet. All within this area must make a Will save each round to avoid being stunned (if the victim has 15 or fewer Hit Dice) or confused (if the victim has more than 15 Hit Dice) for 1 round. The save DC is equal to the dragon's breath weapon save DC. This is a mind-affecting effect. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A crystal dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) upon reaching the listed age category. Very young-color spray; Juvenile-glitterdust; Adult-rainbow pattern; Old- stone to flesh (3/day); Ancient-prismatic spray (3/day); Great wyrm-imprisonment (1/day).  Tremorsense (Ex) Crystal dragons do not gain tremorsense until juvenile age (30 ft.), improving at adult (60 ft.) and old (120 ft.).

Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)  A gray dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.  • Young-fog cloud;  • Juvenile-create water;  • Old-control winds;  • Ancient-control water;  Water Breathing (Ex) A gray dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.																												
Young White Dragon	6.00	2400	Medium	6	20, touch 12, flat-footed 18	66	8	7	5			vulnerability to fire	30 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 150 ft.

This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does. Cold Aura (Su) An adult white dragon radiates an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Freezing Fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice. Ice Tomb (Sp) A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A white dragon gains the following spell-like abilities usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile-fog cloud; Young adult-gust of wind; Ancient-wall of ice; Great wyrm-control weather.

Each Aballonian starts out with one of the abilities listed below. For every two additional abilities it possesses, its CR increases by +1. Aballonians may also add the customizable abilities of animated objects (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14, Pathfinder Adventure Path #43 80), increasing their CRs by +1 for every 2 Construction Points spent in this way. (They are already considered metal.) Aballonians may adapt of their own volition, but it takes 1 day to add each additional ability beyond the first, and they must also possess the rare materials necessary to make such improvements. An ability can only be gained once unless stated otherwise.  • Gain a plasma cutter that deals 1d6 points of fire damage on a melee touch attack.  • Gain advanced treads that increase base speed to 60 feet.  • Modify chassis to gain a burrow, climb, or swim speed of 60 feet. This ability may be taken multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time it is taken, it applies to a new movement type.  • Add a radar dish that grants blindsight 120 feet.  • Gain an additional claw or slam melee attack (1d6 damage).  Lengthen arms to extend reach by 5 feet.  • Gain the rend special attack (2 claws, 1d8+6).  • Add armor plating to gain a +4 natural armor bonus to AC.  • Harden systems to gain resistance 10 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). This ability may be taken multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time it is taken, it applies to a new energy type.  Shortwave (Ex) An Aballonian can communicate with nearby Aballonians via invisible waves. This functions as telepathy 100 ft., but only with other Aballonians. In combat, if any allied Aballonians within range can act in a surprise round, all of them can.  Spark (Ex) As a standard action, an Aballonian can launch an arc of electricity at a nearby creature. This attack has a range of 20 feet with no range increment. In addition, whenever an Aballonian makes a check to maintain a grapple, it can use its spark attack against the creature it is grappling as a free action.  Sunlight Dependency (Ex) Aballonians gain their energy from light. In areas of darkness, they gain the sickened condition.

All creatures adjacent to an aboleth must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 3 hours. Renewed contact with an aboleth's mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 3 hours.  The save DC is Constitution-based.  Slime (Ex) A creature hit by an aboleth's tentacle must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or his skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as it persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This range increases to 120 feet if the opponents are upwind; and decreases to 30 feet if downwind. By making a successful DC 15 Wisdom check the abyssal wolf can determine whether a tiefling or half-fiend is present among the opponents.  Know Alignment (Su) Abyssal wolves always know the alignment of any creature they look upon. This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the abyssal wolf can activate it again as a free action on its next turn.  Paralyzing Gaze (Su) Anyone within 40 feet meeting the gaze of an abyssal wolf must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds.  Half-fiends and tieflings have a -2 circumstance penalty on this save.  Once a successful save is made, the target is immune to the effects of that abyssal wolf's gaze attack for one day.

The adhukait's normal speed does not limit this movement-it can move 10 feet after any successful hit among its four attacks, as long as it has another attack to make.  Dual Mind (Su) An adhukait is a single creature with two distinct minds, so it can attempt two saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If either saving throw succeeds, the mind-affecting effect fails to affect the adhukait.

It cannot make a slam attack during the round in which it engulfs. The algant merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-in a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to an automatic slam attack each round, gain the pinned condition, are in danger of drowning, and are trapped within the algant's body until they are no longer pinned. The save DC is Strength-based.  Animate Plants (Sp) A plant guardian can animate any plants of the same type within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two such plants at a time. It takes 1 full round for the plant to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a plant of the same type as the one animating it (exceptions are noted in each entry below), gaining the plant guardian's vulnerability to fire. If the plant guardian that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the plant immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.

When the angustiden makes a successful grapple attempt following the use of its grab ability, it automatically makes a sunder attempt against the armor worn by the creature grappled as a free action. Each round the grapple is maintained it makes another sunder attempt against its victim's armor.																												
Apparition	7.00	3200	Medium	6	15, touch 15, flat-footed 13	52	5	4	8	incorporeal, channel resistance +2		resurrection vulnerability, sunlight powerlessness	fly 60 ft. (perfect)			5 ft.	5 ft.	create spawn, spectral strangulation	Str -, Dex 14, Con -, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 16	5	7	20	Tome of Horrors Complete	Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid slain by an apparition becomes an apparition itself in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical apparitions, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks. They also receive -2 hp per HD, and a -2 penalty to the Will save DC of their spectral strangulation ability. Spawn are under the command of the apparition that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed apparitions. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.  Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on an apparition destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.  Spectral Strangulation (Su) An apparition attacks an opponent by implanting a suggestion in the victim's mind, convincing it that it is being strangled by the apparition's bony claws. The apparition must be on the same plane as the target creature to use this ability.  The target of the spectral strangulation feels the bony, claw-like fingers of the apparition at its throat-even through armor. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Will save to disbelieve the suggestion. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same apparition's suggestion for one day.  On a failed save, the victim must immediately succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or die from fright due to heart failure.  If the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim acts as if affected by a fear spell for 1d4 rounds. A creature protected by magic circle against evil or protection from evil cannot be affected by an apparition's spectral strangulation. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) Apparitions on the Material Plane are utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. An apparition caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.

If each spell is 3rd-level or less, an arach can cast up to three spells per round; 4th- or 5th-level spells, two per round. An arach cannot multispell spells higher than 5th-level. Poison (Ex) Arach Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Str; cure 1 save. An arach can also coat a single weapon it wields with this poison as a move action. The save DC is Constitution-based. Spider Passivism (Ex) No spiders, monstrous spiders, phase spiders, temporal crawlers, sand stalkers, arachnid werecreatures (such as werespiders) or other spider-like creatures with an Intelligence of 8 or less willingly attack an arach. They can be forced to do so through magical means however. If the arach or one of its allies attacks the creature first, this passivism is negated for that creature for 24 hours.

This cures 1 point of damage per 3 points of damage the spell would otherwise deal (non-damaging spells cure 1 point of damage per spell level). Spells that affect an area are not absorbed, but neither do they affect the arcanoplasm. The arcanoplasm cannot absorb divine magic and is affected normally by such magic. Acid (Ex) An arcanoplasm secretes a highly corrosive acid that dissolves only flesh. Arcane Spell Mimicry (Su) An arcanoplasm can mimic any arcane spell cast within 30 feet of it on its next turn. The spell takes effect as if cast by a 7th-level sorcerer (save DC 14 + spell level) and does not require any components. The arcanoplasm cannot mimic spells a 7th-level arcane caster could not normally cast (i.e., it cannot mimic divine spells, or arcane spells of 5th level or higher). The save DC is Charisma-based. Due to their innately magical nature, an arcanoplasm adds its Constitution modifier in addition to its Charisma modifier to all concentration checks to cast a spell using arcane spell mimicry. Arcanesense (Su) An arcanoplasm can automatically detect the location of any arcane spellcaster within 100 feet. This functions like blindsense but is not blocked by stone, lead, or other material, and can only sense the location of arcane spellcasters Thought to be the result of a failed magic experiment, wizards and sorcerers alike have tried for years to gather information on this alien creature, but thus far such information has eluded even the most resourceful of casters.

Each time a creature suffers damage from a black pudding's acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 21 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a black pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a black pudding remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 21 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by a black pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.  Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a black pudding. Instead, the creature splits into two identical puddings, each with half of the original's current hit points (round down). A pudding with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.  Suction (Ex) The black pudding can create powerful suction against any surface as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A black pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a black pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.

A black troll can induce this effect itself by stepping into a large source of fire that deals 20 or more points of damage in a single round. It must spend one full round in the flames for this method to work. This size change lasts 1 hour before the black troll reverts to its normal size.

Any creature that begins its turn in this area of effect must succeed at a DC 19 Will save, or be affected as per the spell charm person. The blackwood satyr can suppress or resume this ability at will. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Pipes (Su) A blackwood satyr can focus and empower his magical abilities by playing haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot radius must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected by charm monster, deep slumber, reckless infatuation, or suggestion, depending on what tune the satyr chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes' effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the blackwood satyr's other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use of his pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spell-like abilities, and if separated from them, he may continue to use his standard abilities. The pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Each time a brain ooze causes Intelligence damage, it gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Prescience (Su) Limited precognitive abilities grant a brain ooze a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks, on Reflex saves, and to its Armor Class. Brain oozes are never surprised or flat-footed.  Psychic Noise (Su) The discordant psychic noise emitted by  a brain ooze dazes nearby creatures for 1d4 rounds. When a creature begins its turn within the aura, it must succeed at a DC 19 Will save to negate this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same brain ooze's psychic noise for 24 hours. An affected creature may attempt a new save to shake off the effect at the end of each of its turns. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

For 1 minute, the animated bramble (see page 85) then attacks as though it were a Large animated object. The animated bramble is under the control of the brambleblight, which can change the animated bramble's target as a move action. The brambleblight can instead cause the brambles to entwine around creatures as if by the entangle spell (the brambles are considered to be covered in thorns). This effect lasts for 1 hour.  Blight Aura (Su) A brambleblight radiates a palpable aura of rot and decay in a 40-foot radius. Living creatures entering the aura must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. A creature of the animal, fey, or plant type that fails its save is nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 1 minute thereafter. If a creature succeeds at this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. In addition,  any plant creature entering this aura takes 1d6 points of damage each round it is within the area (Fortitude DC 19 half). Creatures that are immune to disease are immune to this aura, and the resist nature's lure class feature applies to the aura's effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Bramble Infestation (Su) A brambleblight can devastate its surroundings, creating an area of dead, thorny brambles. To do so, the brambleblight must root itself in the ground and remain motionless for 24 hours. Over the next day, all plants that are not creatures in a 40-foot radius around the brambleblight sprout thorny brambles, then wither and die. This infestation of brambles persists and nothing grows in this area for as long as the brambleblight remains in the area. If the brambleblight leaves the area, normal growth returns after 1 week.  Improved Woodland Stride (Ex) A brambleblight can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering other impairments. However, it can also move without harm or impediment through thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion.  Plantsense (Ex) A brambleblight can automatically pinpoint the location of anything within 120 feet that is in contact with vegetation.  Rain of Thorns (Ex) With a snap of its thorny vines, a brambleblight can loose a volley of four thorns as a standard action (make an attack roll for each thorn). This attack has a range of 120 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. A brambleblight can launch up to 36 thorns in any 24-hour period.  Thorny (Ex) A brambleblight's surface is covered in a host of thorns. A creature that strikes a brambleblight with a natural weapon, a melee weapon without reach, or an unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. Creatures that grapple a brambleblight automatically take 1d6 points of piercing damage each round they maintain the grapple.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a brass man (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the brass man to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects. Spit Molten Brass (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds (and no more than five times per day), a brass man can spit a stream of molten brass n a 30-foot line; damage 6d6 fire, Reflex half DC 15.

Any melee hit or constriction attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's clothing and armor (nonmetal only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 21 Reflex saves. A wooden weapon that strikes a brown pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a brown pudding remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 21 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by a brown pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.  Suction (Ex) The brown pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A brown pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a brown pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.

When a bulette charges, it can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it makes the Acrobatics check, it can follow up with four claw attacks against foes in reach, but cannot make a bite attack.  Savage Bite (Ex) A bulette's bite is particularly dangerous. It applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage inflicted with its bite attack, and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.

Failure to return to the Elemental Plane of Fire or Plane of Molten Skies after that time deals 1 point of damage per hour to a burning dervish until it dies or returns to the Elemental Plane of Fire.  Flame Form (Su) Three times per day, as a standard action, a burning dervish can change its form to that of a column of fire. In this form it gains two slam attacks. The transformation lasts indefinitely; changing back requires another standard action.

Rage Call (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a capramace can open its mouth and emit a horrible, earpiercing scream to call for its herd. Maintaining a rage call on any round after the first round is a free action and there is no limit to the duration of a sustained rage call.  Non-capramaces within 120 feet that fail a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw are deafened for as long as the capramace maintains its call and for 1d4 minutes afterward.  Any other capramaces within 1 mile can hear this high-pitched cry regardless of external noise conditions, and they instinctively react by sprinting to the capramace in need, moving as fast as possible toward the capramace for as long as it maintains its rage call. A capramace moving toward the source of a rage call is treated as though it possessed the Run feat. Any capramace that comes within 60 feet of another capramace's rage call goes wild with fear and anger, stomping about and attacking the nearest creature in sight for as long as the rage call lasts.  Sound-mitigating effects such as silence or a muzzle of suppression (see page 26) can prevent a capramace from performing its rage call, as can effects that suffocate a capramace. Similarly, a capramace with the deafened condition cannot be affected by the rage cry of another capramace. The save DC is Constitution-based.

If the target fails a DC 18 Will save, the caulborn can alter the victim's memory as if using modify memory. This process deals 1d4 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage to the target. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Cooperative Scrying (Sp) Three or more caulborn joining hands can scry on a place or creature as if using the scrying spell (DC 20), but with no limit to the spell's duration so long as at least three of the caulborn involved continue to join hands and concentrate. This ability functions at CL 7th (or at the highest CL available to the most powerful caulborn in the group). The save DC is Charisma-based, adjusted by the modifier of the caulborn with the highest Charisma score.  Hive Mind (Ex) As long as there are at least two caulborn within 300 feet of each other, if one caulborn in the group is aware of a particular danger, they all are. No caulborn in a group is considered flanked or flat-footed unless all of them are.  Psychic Deflection (Su) A caulborn adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC. The caulborn loses this bonus when unconscious.  Thoughtsense (Su) A caulborn notices and locates living, conscious creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Spells such as nondetection or mind blank make an affected creature undetectable by this sense.

(perfect)	2 slams +15 (1d6 plus chemical burn)		5 ft.	5 ft.	breath weapon (15-ft. cone, 5d6 acid damage plus poison, Reflex DC 18 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), chemical burn (1d6, DC 18)	Str -, Dex 27, Con 20, Int 5, Wis 14, Cha 11	7	-	-	The Emerald Spire	Breath Weapon (Su) In addition to taking acid damage, any creature harmed by a caustic stalker's breath weapon must succeed at an additional DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or be affected by caustic creep poison.  Caustic Creep-inhaled; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Chemical Burn (Su) Any creature struck by the caustic stalker, or that strikes it with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, is affected as if by the burn special attack, but takes acid damage instead of fire damage. The chemical burn persists for multiple rounds, just as a normal burn, but can be ended early if the affected creature is doused in at least 1 gallon of liquid (requiring a full-round action from the victim or another creature) or fully submerges itself in water. Misty Form (Su)A caustic stalker's body is composed of a semisolid chemical mist similar to thick foam. The caustic stalker does not have a Strength score and cannot manipulate or wear solid objects. This form grants it the amorphous defensive ability, and enables it to move through areas as small as 1 inch in diameter with no reduction to its speed. A caustic stalker cannot enter water or other fluids, and is treated as a creature two size categories smaller than its actual size (Tiny for most caustic stalkers) for the purposes of how wind affects it. Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)A caustic stalker takes damage every round that it's exposed to stronger than moderate winds: 1d6 points of damage for strong winds, 2d6 points of damage for severe winds, and an additional 1d6 points of damage for each wind force category beyond severe (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439). Gust of wind is considered severe wind for this ability. A caustic stalker cannot use its breath weapon while being affected by stronger than moderate winds and for 1 minute afterward.																												
Chaos Beast	7.00	3200	Medium	6	20, touch 13, flat-footed 17	85	9	8	4	amorphous, resistant to transformation	18		20 ft.	4 claws +13 (1d6+3 plus corporeal instability)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 17, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 11	9	12	25 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Corporeal Instability (Su) Claw-contact (curse); save Fort DC 17; effect amorphous body and 1 Wisdom drain per round (see below); cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Con-based.  A creature cursed with an amorphous body becomes a spongy, shapeless mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape constantly melts, flows, writhes, and boils. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, helmets, and rings become useless. Large items worn or carried-armor, backpacks, even shirts-hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Speed is reduced to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. The victim gains the amorphous quality, but cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).  A victim can temporarily regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Will save (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. Spells that change the victim's shape (such as alter self, beast shape, elemental body, and polymorph) do not remove the curse, but hold the creature in a stable form (which might not be its own form, depending on the spell) and prevent additional Wisdom drain for the duration of the spell; shapechange and stoneskin have a similar effect. The victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock every round that it ends its turn in an amorphous shape-upon being drained to 1 Wisdom, further Wisdom drain ceases and the amorphous body effect is permanent until removed via magic (no further number of saving throws can cure the condition at this time).  Resistant to Transformation (Ex) Transmutation effects, such as polymorphing or petrification, force a chaos beast into a new shape, but at the start of its next turn, it immediately returns to its normal form as a free action.																												
Charda	7.00	3200	Small	2	20, touch 13, flat-footed 18	85	7	10	7	ferocity			20 ft., swim 60 ft.	bite +13 (1d6+3 plus 1d6 cold), 4 claws +14 (1d4+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	black bile	Str 16, Dex 15, Con 19, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 8	9	+11 (+19 bull rush and trip)	23	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Black Bile (Su) A charda's body seethes with freezing black bile. Its supernaturally cold, black bile is the source of the additional cold damage when a charda bites a creature. As a standard action, a charda can expel its full store of bile as a breath weapon that can take the form of a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone. All creatures in this area take 8d6 points of cold damage (DC 18 Reflex half ). A charda can use this breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds-while its black bile is recharging, it does not deal additional cold damage with its bite. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Cold Vigor (Ex) When a charda is in a cold environment, it becomes more animated and gains a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.  Overwhelming (Ex) A charda gains a +8 racial bonus on bull rush and trip attacks.

Regardless of its type, a chimera's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 6d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 17 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. To determine a chimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below. d10 Head Color Breath Weapon 1-2 Black 40-foot line of acid 3-4 Blue 40-foot line of lightning 5-6 Green 20-foot cone of acid 7-8 Red 20-foot cone of fire 9-10 White 20-foot cone of cold

The tentacles grapple with the same strength as the claw but deal no damage, instead exuding a paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the tentacles must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save each round on the chuul's turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes 1d8+7 points of damage each round from the creature's mandibles.																												
Cinder Ghoul	7.00	3200	Large	9	21, touch 15, flat-footed 15	68	6	9	7	limited gaseous form		vulnerability to cold	fly 40 ft. (perfect)	slam +10 (1d8+4 plus 1d6 fire plus burn plus energy  drain)		10 ft.	5 ft.	burn (1d8, DC 18), energy drain (1 level, DC 18), smoke inhalation	Str 16, Dex 20, Con -, Int 4, Wis 12, Cha 19	6	10	26 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Limited Gaseous Form (Ex) Because it has solid body parts that constantly float and swirl within it, a cinder ghoul has a limited version of the gaseous form ability. Although other gaseous creatures can issue under the crack of a door, a cinder ghoul cannot. A cinder ghoul can, however, make slam attacks, retains its natural armor bonus, and all supernatural attacks. Spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities affect them normally. A cinder ghoul cannot enter water or other liquid. It is not ethereal or incorporeal, and is affected by winds or other forms of moving air to the extent that the wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving.  However, even the strongest wind can't disperse or damage a cinder ghoul. Because it contains burning embers and small bits of perpetually smoldering flesh, a cinder ghoul cannot hide and gets no bonuses to Stealth checks in an area of mist, smoke, or other gas.  Smoke Inhalation (Su) As a standard action, a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its smoky form into the lungs of a living opponent. To initiate this attack it must move into its target's space. The target must then make a successful DC 18 Fortitude save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside the victim's lungs burns the surrounding tissues and organs, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round. The affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each round to cough out the burning residue. The save DC is Charisma-based.

As part of a charge, a deinotherium can move up to twice its base speed in a straight line and make a gore attack at any point during its movement. If this attack is successful, the target is knocked prone and the deinotherium can deal damage with its trample attack before continuing its movement.

Str 15, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 17	10	1	11 (15 vs. trip)	AP 52	Manipulate Path (Su) As a standard action, a dosojin can alter the structure and stability of its ward, making travel along its road or trail either easier or harder for specific groups of travelers. Helping travelers in this way makes a dosojin's ward sturdier and more straightforward, allowing creatures to reach their destination in half the time they would normally take (though this does not grant a bonus to creatures' movement speeds in combat). If a dosojin instead chooses to hinder travelers, it creates unexpected twists and turns within its ward, turning the path into difficult terrain and so causing travelers to take twice as long as they normally would to reach their destination. These effects last as long as the targets stay within the boundaries of the dosojin's ward.  Mimic Statue (Su) As a standard action, a dosojin can assume the appearance of any Medium-sized statue, such as a stone marker, a religious icon, or a sculpture carved into the side of a cliff. A dosojin's body is hard and has the texture of rough stone no matter what appearance it takes. A dosojin gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks when imitating a statue in this manner.

It can only use its breath weapon once every 10 rounds (1/minute).  Flying Charge (Ex) A dragon horse gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls if it charges while flying.  Plane Shift (Sp) A dragon horse can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, Elemental Plane of Air, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the dragon horse and up to two other creatures, provided they are on its back.

All creatures except dragonnes within 120 feet must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Those within 30 feet who fail their saves are also deafened for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spells A drider casts spells as a 6th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard, but does not gain any other class abilities.  Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although a drider is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid's upper torso. As a result, it wields weapons as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium for most driders).																												
Drocha Swarm	7.00	3200	Tiny	4	20, touch 20, flat-footed 16	76	7	7	5	incorporeal swarm traits			0 ft., fly 30 ft.

This allows it to deal its swarm damage to corporeal foes, and to deal normal damage to incorporeal creatures such as ghosts, shadow demons, and even other drocha swarms.  Project Death (Su) As a standard action, a drocha swarm can target a creature within 30 feet and cry mournful wails that fill the listener with images of its own death. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save to steel itself against this morbid onslaught. If that save fails, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim takes 4d6 points of damage. A creature that successfully saves against the initial Will save is not subject to the same drocha swarm's project death ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

When it wields a slashing weapon, the blade inflicts +1d6 cold damage and gains the keen weapon property.  Death's Calling (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a dullahan may place death's calling on a target within 60 feet (DC 22 Fortitude negates). If the dullahan knows and speaks the target's name, the target takes a -2 penalty on the save. If the victim fails the save, he becomes staggered for 1d6 rounds. For the next 24 hours (or until the dullahan is slain), all critical hits against the victim automatically confirm.  Finally, the victim automatically fails all Constitution checks to stabilize while dying. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Summon Mount (Su) As a standard action, a dullahan can summon a war-trained heavy horse with the fiendish creature simple template. This horse remains until it is slain or the dullahan dismisses it. He can only have one such horse in his service at a time.

Each time a creature suffers damage from a dun pudding's acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 20 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a dun pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. If a dun pudding remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 20 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by a dun pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.

The ravenous hounds attack as a single unit, have a +11 attack bonus, deal 2d6+3 points of force damage on a successful hit, and threaten a critical hit on a natural 20. This ability is otherwise identical to mage's sword (CL 7th).  Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a duppy destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.  Strength Drain (Su) Creatures hit by a duppy's touch attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. On each successful attack, the duppy gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This effect activates before the dweomercat is affected by the spell targeting it and regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes its spell resistance. Each power lasts for 1 minute per level of the spell targeting the dweomercat, until the dweomercat uses this ability again, or until the dweomercat chooses to dismiss the effect as a free action, whichever duration is shortest. This ability does not prevent the spell affecting the dweomercat from taking effect; it only provides an additional benefit. Abjuration: Gains acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic resistance equal to 2 per spell level. Conjuration: Gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to +1 for every 5 levels of the spell. Divination: Gains the effects of detect chaos, evil, good, or law. Enchantment: Grants the effects of the spell heroism. Evocation: Inflicts an amount of damage equal to the spell's level upon the spell's caster. Illusion: Grants the effects of invisibility. This effect ends as per the spell. Necromancy: Gains the effects of false life, as if cast by the opposing spell's caster. Transmutation: Gains an enhancement bonus on its natural weapons equal to +1 for every 5 levels of the spell..

The construct must make an additional combat maneuver check against its target to reposition it into an advantageous position. If it succeeds, and the victim remains grappled at the beginning of the construct's next round, the ebon acolytus may make use of its sacrifice ability. An ebon acolytus gains a +2 bonus on its CMB for the purposes of making this check if it is adjacent to an altar or similar site of ceremonial bloodletting. Sacrifice (Su) As a full-round action, an ebon acolytus may make a coup de grace attack with its dagger against any target currently grappled into place using its prostration ability. The target is affected by the coup de grace attack and must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die as normal. If the target is killed by this attack, his soul is sent straight to the plane of the being to which the altar is dedicated, regardless of alignment, and cannot be raised from the dead except by a cleric sworn to the same deity or by a miracle or wish spell. A creature under the effects of a protection from evil spell-or similar spell that opposes the alignment of the god the ebon acolytus is crafted to serve-may be resurrected as normal.																												
Ekimmu	7.00	3200	Medium	7	19, touch 19, flat-footed 15	84	7	5	10	channel resistance +4, incorporeal, rejuvenation			fly 30 ft.

This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.  Lifesense (Su) An ekimmu notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Malevolence (Su) The ekimmu's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ekimmu can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (CL 8th), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ekimmu must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 21 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ekimmu's malevolence for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the ekimmu's Ability Focus feat.  Paralyzing Howl (Su) At will, an ekimmu can let out a fearsome howl that paralyzes all within a 30 feet radius for 1d4+1 rounds unless they succeed on a DC 19 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that ekimmu's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy an ekimmu through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d6 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy an ekimmu is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from entering the underworld.

The save DC is Charisma-based.  Corporeal Form (Su) Whenever an ephemeral echo deals Charisma damage to a creature, it absorbs a portion of its victim's anguish and becomes more real. It loses the incorporeal subtype and gains a Strength score equal to its Charisma score. Its deflection bonus to AC becomes a natural armor bonus, and its incorporeal touch attack is replaced with two slam attacks. The ephemeral echo loses its fly speed and gains a land speed of 30 feet. These changes last for 1d4 rounds or until the ephemeral echo takes any Charisma damage, whichever comes first. The third time in a day an ephemeral echo deals Charisma damage, its corporeal form lasts for 24 hours or until it takes Charisma damage, whichever comes first.  Rejuvenation (Su) Each ephemeral echo is tied to a unique fetter-some event, location, or object that reminds it of the sadness of its former life. Resolving this fetter (by consecrating the location or destroying the item, for example) destroys the ephemeral echo permanently. If the echo is physically injured or killed but its fetter remains unresolved, the echo rejuvenates fully in 1d10 days.  Stolen Power (Su) Whenever an ephemeral echo deals Charisma damage or drain, it gains a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks until the end of its next turn. The echo also gains 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour.																												
Flagstone Golem	7.00	3200	Large	1	20, touch 10, flat-footed 19	74	2	3	2	energy absorption, flatten			30 ft.	2 slams +13 (2d8+6 plus stun)		10 ft.	10 ft.	stunning blow	Str 22, Dex 12, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	8	15	26	Tome of Horrors Complete	Camouflage (Ex) While flattened, a flagstone golem is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding floor. It takes a DC 25 Perception check to notice a flattened flagstone golem for what it is. Dwarves get a +2 bonus on Perception checks to notice a flattened flagstone golem. Energy Absorption (Su) Any energy-based (acid, fire, cold, electricity, sonic) attack that directly targets a flagstone golem is absorbed into its body dealing no damage to the golem. A flagstone golem can use the absorbed energy to repair itself, healing 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage the attack would have otherwise dealt. Or it can release the energy in a 30-foot cone that deals 3d8 points of energy damage (of whatever type was absorbed) to all within the area. An affected opponent can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitutionbased. The flagstone golem can store the energy before releasing it as an energy blast for a number of rounds equal to half its Hit Dice (four rounds for the standard flagstone golem). Flatten (Ex) As a standard action, once per round, a flagstone golem can flatten its form to become (or appear to become) a section of floor, road, or any other stone surface. While flattened it cannot move or attack and its damage reduction increases to 20/adamantine. A flagstone golem can reform into its humanoid shape as a standard action. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A flagstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A transmute mud to rock spell heals all its lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem's structure, but it negates the flagstone golem's damage reduction for 1 round. Stunning Blow (Ex) Any creature hit by a flagstone golem's slam attack must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Flesh Golem	7.00	3200	Large	-1	20, touch 8, flat-footed 20	79	3	2	3				30 ft.	2 slams +13 (2d8+5)		10 ft.	10 ft.	berserk	Str 20, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	9	15	24	PFRPG Bestiary	Berserk (Ex) When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which requires a DC 19 Charisma check. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem's berserk chance to 0%.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save).  • A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.  A flesh golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.

This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 7d6 points of cold damage (DC 18 Reflex half) to all creatures in a 20-foot-radius spread. The mist cakes all surfaces in the area with a sheet of slippery ice that turns the area into difficult terrain for 2d4 rounds, after which the ice cracks or melts enough to revert to the normal terrain features in the area. Once a frost drake has used its freezing mist breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like spider climb, but the surfaces the drake climbs must be icy. It can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a frost drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.  Snow Vision (Ex) A frost drake can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

It takes 1d4 points of cold damage every round it is exposed to direct sunlight.  Compulsive Hunger (Ex) Despite being undead, a gaki is plagued by an insatiable hunger, and believes it can gain a normal body or rest in peace if it consumes the right mixture of flesh, food, and drink. A gaki that finds a corpse or is offered food, wine, holy water, or flowers must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or spend one turn trying to grab and consume it. Its narrow neck prevents it from swallowing more than a tiny amount, and it gives up after 1 round of attempting to do so. A gaki that consumes holy water in this way is not harmed by it.

Creatures hitting an acid quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack. Acid Swimmer (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic nature of their environment on their home plane. Drench (Ex) The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals the quasi-elemental's HD). Fumes (Ex) The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body act as an inhaled poison. Creatures within 5 ft. of an acid quasi-elemental must make succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage each round. This poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves more than 5 ft. away from the acid quasi-elemental. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by water. An acid quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasi-elemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental.

It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 5 for each growth point it gains. For every 2 growth points, a barghest's caster level for its spell-like abilities and its CR increase by +1. When a barghest reaches 4 growth points, it sheds its skin and becomes a greater barghest, losing all of its growth points (and bonuses) but gaining the stats presented on this page for a greater barghest.

Any creature in a space directly in front of a greater basilisk must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the breath of the same greater basilisk for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Gaze (Ex) Turn to stone permanently (as stone to flesh), range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 18 negates. A creature petrified in this manner that is then coated (not just splashed) with fresh basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk no more that 1 hour dead) is instantly restored to flesh. A single greater basilisk contains enough blood to coat 1d4 Medium creatures in this manner. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A creature caught in the area can make a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics for each elemental's death throes. Molten Glass (Ex) A successful hit against an obsidian quasi-elemental with a piercing or slashing weapon (or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage equal to its current HD opens a wound that spurts molten glass. The wound bleeds for 1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a Reflex save or take fire damage from the splash. A new save must be made each round the wound bleeds and a creature is within the area. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.

As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a halsora can jerk its head and flick the acidic tears on a single creature within 20 feet. That creature takes 2d6 acid damage (Reflex DC 18 half). A creature that fails its save takes an additional 1d4 points of acid damage at the end of the halsora's turn for 1d4 rounds or until the acid is scraped off, which requires a full-round action on the part of the creature taking the damage or a creature adjacent to that creature. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spores (Ex) A halsora's claws are covered in mutated russet mold spores. A creature hit by a claw attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution damage per round. It can attempt a new Fortitude save each round to halt the growth. A creature reduced to 0 Constitution by these spores explodes in a mess of viscera and spores. Creatures within the burst must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or be affected as if they were hit by the halsora's claw attack. This is a disease effect. The save is Constitution-based.

Creatures in the area must make a DC 20 Will save or believe the hangman tree to be a perfectly ordinary tree- or at worst, a treant or some other friendly tree-like creature. An affected creature becomes passive for 2d6 minutes and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time. An affected creature can attempt a new Will save each round that the tree attacks an ally-if a hallucinating creature is attacked by the tree, it gains a +4 bonus on its Will save to see through the hallucination. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vines (Ex) A hangman tree's vines are primary attacks that deal bludgeoning damage. When a hangman tree grapples a foe with its vines, the tree does not gain the grappled condition. A hangman tree that uses swallow whole transfers a pinned creature from a vine to inside its trunk.

Hallucinatory Spores (Ex) As a standard action, a hangman tree can release a cloud of spores in a 50-foot radius spread. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell for 2d6 minutes. Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be a treant or other such friendly tree creature). An affected creature becomes passive and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. An affected creature can attempt a new Will save (DC 19, +1 per previous save) each round. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected by the hallucinatory spores of that hangman's tree for 24 hours. Paralyzed by Cold (Ex) Cold-based effects paralyze a hangman tree as if by a hold person spell. Slowed by Darkness (Ex) Spells that generate darkness (such as darkness or deeper darkness) slow the hangman's tree (as the slow spell) for 1 round per caster level. Vines (Ex) The vines of a hangman tree have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a hangman tree's vine does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the vine is currently grappling a target, the hangman tree takes a -4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a vine deals no damage to a hangman tree.

They may use greater teleport (self only) once per round as a swift action and plane shift (self only) 3/day as a standard action (caster level 10th). A hound of Tindalos can use these powers anywhere, but its destination point must be adjacent to a fixed angle or corner in the physical environment, such as a wall, floor, or ceiling (as determined by the GM); temporary angles created by cloth, flesh, or small items are not sufficient. It cannot use these abilities to enter curved architecture or open outdoor environments.  Otherworldly Mind (Ex) Any non-outsider attempting to read the thoughts of a hound of Tindalos or communicate with it telepathically takes 5d6 points of nonlethal damage and must make a DC 18 Will save or become confused for 2d4 rounds.  This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Ripping Gaze (Su) 5d6 slashing damage, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 18 negates. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to that hound's gaze for 24 hours. Damage caused by a ripping gaze can be defeated by damage reduction, but it bypasses DR/magic and slashing. The save DC is Charisma-based.

If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Earth Mastery (Ex) An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)

Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds.

Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A control water spell cast on an area containing a burrowing ice elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the elemental climbs must be icy. The elemental can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Numbing Cold (Su) When an ice elemental deals cold damage to a creature, that creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is listed in the elemental's stat block and is Constitution-based. Snow Vision (Ex) An ice elemental can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Lava Puddle (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a puddle of lava (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) that fills its space to a depth of 2-3 inches and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round. The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after a number of rounds equal to the elemental's Hit Dice. At the GM's discretion, this puddle of lava could start secondary fires.

An entangled opponent suffers tentacle damage and the effect of its poison each round the hold is maintained. An entangled creature still receives a save to avoid the effects of its poison. While a foe is entangled, the sea wasp cannot attack any other creature. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; the effects of the poison are determined by the creature's size (see table below). The DC of the save is Constitution-based. Size Fort DC Frequency Effect Cure Tiny 10 1/round for 1d4 rounds 1 Con 1 save Small 11 1/round for 1d4 rounds 1d2 Con 1 save Medium 11 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d3 Con 1 save Large 13 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d4 Con 2 consecutive saves Huge 15 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d6 Con 2 consecutive saves Gargantuan 20 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d8 Con 3 consecutive saves Jet (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp can jet backward once per round as a full-round action at a speed equal to four times its swim speed. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting. Transparent (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp is nearly invisible floating in the water. An observer must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice the sea wasp. Watersense (Ex) Monstrous sea wasps can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with water.																												
Huge Mud Elemental	7.00	3200	Huge	3	20, touch 12, flat-footed 16	95	11	10	3				20 ft., burrow 10 ft., swim 30 ft.	2 slams +15 (2d6+7 plus entrap)		15 ft.	15 ft.	entrap (DC 19, 10 minutes, hardness 5, hp 15)	Str 24, Dex 16, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	10	19	33	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing mud elemental can pass through dirt, gravel, or other loose or porous solid matter as easily as a fish swims through water. It cannot use this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Entrap (Ex) The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3 rounds of immersion in water.

Burn (Ex) A smoke elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn as hot as a true fire elemental's flames.  Engulf (Ex) A smoke elemental can engulf creatures of its size or smaller into its smoky form as part of a standard action. It cannot make any other attack in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that are not adjacent to them.  Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Gaseous (Ex) A smoke elemental can pass through small holes or narrow openings without reducing its speed.  Vulnerability to Wind (Ex) A smoke elemental is treated as two sizes smaller for purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.																												
Huge Water Elemental	7.00	3200	Huge	4	21, touch 13, flat-footed 16	95	11	11	3				20 ft., swim 90 ft.	2 slams +15 (2d6+7)		15 ft.	15 ft.	drench, vortex (DC 22), water mastery	Str 24, Dex 18, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	10	19	34	PFRPG Bestiary	Drench (Ex) The elemental's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental's HD). Vortex (Su) A water elemental can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (see page 306), but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water. Water Mastery (Ex) A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.

A gliding hydrodaemon gains the pounce ability.  Sleep Spittle (Ex) A hydrodaemon can fire a line of spittle at a single target within 20 feet, making a ranged touch attack as a standard action. A target hit by the spittle must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or fall asleep for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Creatures that are fatigued or under the effects of see invisibility can see an ikelos, but its nature is partially obscured. An ikelos gains the benefit of partial concealment against such creatures. In addition, its claws deal 3d6 points of damage to such creatures, instead of 2d6. Creatures that are exhausted or under the effects of true seeing can see the ikelos clearly. They suffer no miss chance when striking the ikelos. However, an ikelos's claws deal 4d6 points of damage to such creatures, instead of 2d6.  Fear Dependency (Ex) An ikelos is a creature of nightmares, and it depends completely on fear for its sustenance. An ikelos doesn't recover hit point damage naturally and cannot heal by any means other than its feed on fear ability.  Feed on Fear (Su) Anytime an ikelos is within 15 feet of a dying creature or a creature subject to a fear effect, it gains fast healing 5.  Frightful Gaze (Su) Creatures within 30 feet that meet an ikelos's gaze must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be  paralyzed with fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect and a paralysis effect. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to the frightful gaze of that ikelos for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Lethargy Aura (Su) An ikelos exudes an aura that makes nearby creatures increasingly lethargic. Creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become fatigued. Fatigued creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become exhausted. The effects of the aura end 10 rounds after an affected creature exits the aura. An ikelos can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action. Ikeloses are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Natural Invisibility (Ex) This ability is constant-an invisible stalker remains invisible at all times, even when attacking. As this ability is inherent, it is not subject to the invisibility purge spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint it, the invisible stalker gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving, or +40 when standing still-these bonuses are not included in the statistics above.																												
Irradiated Dead	7.00	3200	Medium	7	19, touch 14, flat-footed 15	85	6	6	9	channel resistance +2			30 ft.	2 slams +12 (1d6+5 plus radiation)		5 ft.	5 ft.	create spawn, radioactive, radioactive spew	Str 20, Dex 16, Con -, Int 7, Wis 15, Cha 17	7	11	26	AP 87	Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by an irradiated dead's radiation becomes an irradiated dead itself in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical irradiated dead, taking a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and having 2 fewer hit points per Hit Die. Spawn are under the command of the irradiated dead that created them and remain enslaved until its destruction, at which point they lose their spawn penalties to d20 rolls and become full-fledged and free-willed irradiated dead. They don't possess any of the abilities they had in life.  Radioactive (Ex) Any creature that comes in contact with an irradiated dead risks infection from the radiation that consumes the creatures. Any creature hit by an irradiated dead's slam attack or radioactive spew risks infection, as does any creature who touches an irradiated dead. On a failed saving throw, the target is affected by medium radiation and radiates low radiation in a 10-foot radius for as long as it remains afflicted. For more information on radiation, see page 55 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Radiation: Slam-contact; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Radioactive Spew (Ex) Three times per day as a standard action, an irradiated dead can spew a 15-foot cone of irradiated viscera from its mouth. Creatures in the area take 2d6 points of acid damage and are subjected to the creature's radiation. A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. Creatures that takes damage from this effect are subject to the irradiated dead's radioactive special ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)  A gray dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.  • Young-fog cloud;  • Juvenile-create water;  • Old-control winds;  • Ancient-control water;  Water Breathing (Ex) A gray dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.

This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.

Even if the save is successful, the creature suffers 2d6 points of damage as the kamarupa clutches its heart. Often, a creature surviving a touch attack acquires a harmless trait or characteristic for 2d4 months. Traits can be a white streak of hair, a nervous twitch, pale complexion or dilated eyes. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Frightful Gaze (Su) A kamarupa's glance creates dread in living beings, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures meeting the gaze must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or become panicked for 3d4 rounds. Even if successful, the subject becomes shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Nightmare (Su) Once per night, a kamarupa places a nightmare on one creature it has encountered. They prefer to send the nightmare to particularly powerful opponents or priests night after night until the opponent dies. The target can resist the attack with a DC 17 Will save. A creature that drops any possession (while panicked) near the kamarupa suffers a -4 penalty to the save until the item is recovered. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the nightmare for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Powerless in Sunlight (Ex) Kamarupas are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and fl ee before it. A kamarupa caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a single move action each round. Kamarupas lose one-third of their hit points each round spent in direct sunlight.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals sense the kamarupa's unnatural presence at 30 feet. They panic if forced to get closer and remain panicked while within range.

Whenever a creature strikes a magma ooze with a weapon, that weapon takes 4d6 points of fire damage unless the attacker makes a DC 19 Fortitude save. Damage caused to weapons in this manner is not halved, but hardness does help prevent some of the damage dealt. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A significant amount of water, such as that created by a create water spell, the contents of a large bucket, or a blow from a water elemental, that strikes a magma ooze forces the creature to make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 2d4 rounds. A magma ooze that is immersed in water must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (this DC increases by +1 each subsequent round) or become petrified, reverting once the water is gone.

Any melee hit deals 2d6 points of fire damage initially and 1d6 points of damage for the next 1d3 rounds. Creatures attacking a magmoid unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage each time one of their attacks hits just as if the magmoid had hit with a melee attack. Magma Blast (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a magmoid can release a line of magma to a range of 40 feet. This deals 2d6 points of damage in the round it hits a foe (DC 17 Reflex save for half), and 1d6 points of damage for another 1d3 rounds (no save). Melt Weapons (Ex) Any metal weapon that strikes a magmoid must make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-based.

She does not detect as undead during the day, but is still an undead creature. At night, her upper torso rips away (this is a full round action that occurs at sunset), leaving her lower torso behind. Her lower torso is helpless, but her upper torso gains its fly speed and natural attacks at this time. The upper and lower portions share the same pool of hit points (despite any intervening distance), and if the helpless lower portion is damaged, the manananggal is immediately aware of the attack. Since manananggals can be destroyed by damage to their lower bodies, they prefer to hide their lower torsos when separated. A manananggal must return to its lower torso and reattach to it (a full-round action) within the hour before sunrise-each round a manananggal remains separated after sunrise, it takes 1d6 points of damage until it rejoins its lower torso or it crumbles into dust.  Vulnerable to Light Blades (Ex): Light blades (such as daggers, kamas, kukris, rapiers, short swords, sickles, and starknives) deal double the weapon's base damage on a successful hit against a manananggal.

The save DC is Charisma-based.  Lash of Fury (Su) The mordnaissant can lash out with its negative energy powers and directly attack the vitality of living creatures, in the form of a twisting stream of black energy. The mordnaissant must make a ranged touch attack against its target as an attack action. If the ray hits, the victim must make a DC 22 Fortitude save for half damage or duration, depending on the specific effect chosen by the mordnaissant. The save DC is Charisma-based. The lash of fury has a range of 30 ft. with no range increment.  The mordnaissant can pick from three possible lashes; it must make its choice prior to rolling the attack. The three options are: whip the flesh (as inflict moderate wounds, 2d8+9 damage), whip the mind (1d4 points of Intelligence damage), or whip the soul (stun 1d4+1 rounds). A critical hit doubles the damage rolled or the duration, in the case of whip the soul.  Lifesense (Su) A mordnaissant notices and locates living creatures within 60 ft., just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Pain Wail (Su) As a swift action, the mordnaissant can produce a terrible wailing sound that reflects the pain it experiences every moment of its existence. All living creatures within 20 ft. must make a DC 20 Will save or be dazed for one round. For every 20 points of damage the mordnaissant takes, the save DC increases by +1.  Shield of Agony (Su) A mordnaissant harnesses the pain of its existence to shield it. It adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC and CMD.

Any melee hit deals acid damage.  Divide (Ex) A mustard jelly can, as a standard action, split itself into two identical jellies, each with half of the original's current hit points (round down). A jelly with 10 hit points or less cannot divide itself. When divided, each jelly moves faster than the original (base speed 40 feet per round).  Energy Absorption (Ex) A mustard jelly is immune to electrical effects and magic missiles. If targeted by an electricity effect (including area effects) or a magic missile spell, the mustard jelly gains temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage it would have otherwise sustained.  These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.  Poison Aura (Ex) The mustard jelly exudes an aura of poison in a 10-foot radius centered on it that slows (as the slow spell) any creature in the area as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward if it fails a DC 21 Fortitude save. A new save must be made each round a creature is within 10 feet of the mustard jelly. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to the lamia's aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Spells A mythic lamia casts spells as a 6th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a mythic lamia.  Wisdom Drain (Su) A lamia drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time she hits with her melee touch attack. (Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a lamia does not heal any damage when she uses her Wisdom drain.) Lamias try to use this power early in an encounter to make foes more susceptible to charm monster and suggestion.																												
Mythic Mummy	7.00	3200	Medium	0	23, touch 10, flat-footed 23	92	4	2	8			vulnerable to fire	20 ft.	slam +15 (1d8+12 plus mummy rot)		5 ft.	5 ft.	create spawn, mythic power (3/day, surge +1d6)	Str 26, Dex 10, Con -, Int 6, Wis 15, Cha 15	6	14	24	Mythic Adventures	Create Spawn (Su) As a swift action, a mythic mummy can expend one use of mythic power to transform a slain opponent into a non-mythic mummy with the advanced simple template. The new mummy is under the command of the mummy that created it, and remains enslaved until the mythic mummy's death, at which time it becomes a free-willed creature. The spawn retains none of the abilities it had in life  Desert Mastery (Su) A mythic mummy can command earth and sand within 100 feet to c reate a variety of spell-like effects. As a s tandard action, a mummy can reduce rock to sand (as transmute rock to mud) or create lifelike shapes made from sand (as major image, though these shapes collapse if disbelieved or attacked). The mummy can expend one use of mythic power to summon a giant advanced sandman (Bestiary 2 236). The mummy's caster level equals its Hit Dice for these effects.  Despair (Su) All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a mummy must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. A creature only has to attempt this save against a particular mummy's despair ability once every 24 hours. This is a paralysis and mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Mummy Rot (Su) Curse and disease-slam; save Fort DC 18; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure -. This otherwise functions like standard mummy rot. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Nabasu Demonling	7.00	3200	Medium	5	23, touch 11, flat-footed 22	73	10	3	8		18		30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Living creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner transforms into a ghoul in 1d4 rounds under the control of the nabasu that created it. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the nabasu dies, any ghouls under its control become free-willed. Plane Shift (Su) Three times per day a nabasu demonling can shift to the Material Plane, and a mature nabasu can shift between the Abyss and the Material Plane or back. This transports the nabasu and up to six other creatures provided they all link hands with the nabasu. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (CL 10th for the demonling and CL 13th for the mature nabasu). Feed (Su) When a nabasu creates a ghoul with its gaze attack, it gains a growth point. It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, caster level checks, and skill checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 10 for each growth point it gains and its caster level increases by 1. For every 2 growth points, its natural armor bonus, SR, and CR increases by +1. Each time it gains a growth point, the nabasu demonling makes a DC 30 caster level check-success indicates it becomes a mature nabasu. At 10 growth points, a demonling automatically becomes a mature nabasu.																												
Naunet	7.00	3200	Large	7	20, touch 12, flat-footed 17	94	11	11	6	amorphous anatomy, freedom of movement	18		30 ft., fly 30 ft.

As a free action once per round, a naunet may infuse all of its natural attacks with adamantine, silver, or cold iron, thereby allowing it to overcome damage reduction of those types as well.  Coalesce Chaos (Su) Once per day as a standard action, three or more naunets working together can create a roiling cloud of multicolored chaos matter. This effect is identical to solid fog (CL 12th) and lasts for 2d6 rounds. If six or more naunets are present, the coalesced chaos instead functions as acid fog (CL 12th).  Confusion (Su) A creature struck by a naunet's tentacle attack is infused with raw chaos, and must make a DC 19 Will save or be confused for 1 round. Rounds of confusion dealt in this manner stack. A creature with a chaotic component to its alignment gains a +4 bonus on saves against this effect, and creatures with the chaotic subtype are immune. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Any living creature within this area takes 1 point of damage per round until it leaves the area. Undead in the area heal 1 hit point each round they remain in the area. Undead cannot more hit points than their normal total from the netherspark's aura.  Negative Energy Burst (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a netherspark can release a burst of negative energy in a 20-foot radius around it. Creatures in the area take 1d8+10 points of negative energy damage. Undead take no damage but heal a number of hit points equal to what the ray would otherwise deal.  Negative Energy Ray (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a netherspark can release a ray of negative energy with a rangte of 40 feet as a ranged touch attack. A target hit takes gains one negative level if it fails a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw. On a successful save, the target avoids the negative level but still takes 1d8 points of negative energy damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Str 10, Dex 14, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 18	2	2	15	Tome of Horrors 4	Spells Niserie can cast divine spells as 7th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.  Water Form (Ex) As a standard action, a niserie can turn into a mobile pool of water. This functions like gaseous form, except that the niserie cannot fly in this form. It retains its own base speed, and its swim speed doubles to 80 feet. The niserie can remain in her water form for a number of minutes equal to twice her Constitution bonus and can end this ability as a standard action.  A spell with the cold descriptor inflicts no damage on a niserie in its water form, but instead automatically slows the creature as per the spell for 1d6 rounds or until she leaves her water form.  A spell with the electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor inflicts normal damage on a niserie in its water form.																												
Nixudaemon	7.00	3200	Large	5	20, touch 10, flat-footed 19	95	7	8	9		18		40 ft.	2 slams +12 (1d8+3), 2 +1 deadly merciful vicious whip arms +13 (1d8+4 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.

Attacks with these whips count as natural attacks for the nixudaemon, have a reach of 20 feet, and don't provoke attacks of opportunity. The whips can't be disarmed or sundered, nor can they be dropped to allow the nixudaemon to avoid being tripped because of failing a combat maneuver check to trip. The nixudaemon decides before each attack roll whether to apply the weapon's merciful special ability, its vicious special ability, both, or neither.  Dead Tired (Su) A nixudaemon's attacks drain every bit of vitality from its victims when they die. Raising a creature killed by a nixudaemon (via raise dead or another effect that restores life) requires a successful DC 20 caster level check. The restored creature gains the exhausted condition, regardless of the spell used to raise it. The DC of this caster level check is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. A nixudaemon can use its temporary resurrection spell-like ability without attempting this check, even if another nixudaemon killed the subject.  Enslave (Su) If a nixudaemon successfully uses its grab ability to grapple a foe with its whip attack, its tendril wraps around the victim's throat. The daemon can forgo its constrict damage and instead attempt to dominate the subject, as the spell dominate monster (Will DC 18 negates). A creature dominated by a nixudaemon is immune to fatigue, exhaustion, and pain effects. At the beginning of its turn, a dominated slave automatically receives a new saving throw to end the effect. The nixudaemon can dominate only one creature at a time per whip arm it possesses (typically two). The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based.

The target must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be affected by this effect. In addition to being subject to suggestion's normal effects, any creature affected by the contagious whisper can pass the enchantment on to other targets. Doing so requires the target to communicate the nogitsune's suggestion, forcing the new target to save as if it were the initial target. If such a secondary target resists the contagious whisper, it is unaffected, but this does not remove the suggestion from the initial target. Failing  the save puts another creature under the nogitsune's compulsion. Newly affected creatures are also able to spread the suggestion. A nogitsune's compelling whisper can affect a number of creatures equal to the its Hit Dice and lasts for a number of hours equal to its Hit Dice. Creatures that successfully save versus the nogitsune's compelling whisper (as a primary or secondary target) cannot be affected by that particular nogitsune's compelling whisper for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Fleet Distraction (Su) A nogitsune can make a Bluff check or use its obscuring mist spell-like ability as a swift action in any round in which it moves up to half its base land speed.  Poison Use (Ex) Nogitsune are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Their aptitude is such that they often paint their weapons and nails with blue whinnis.  Blue Whinnis: injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; initial effect 1 Con damage; secondary effect unconsciousness for 1d3 hours; cure 1 save

They literally run over (as an overrun that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) anything of size Gargantuan or smaller that is in their path, but no CMB check is necessary, and the target cannot choose to let them pass without taking any damage. The stampede deals 5d6 points of damage for every two aurochs in the herd (rounded up). Any victims of the stampede can make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Nymph	7.00	3200	Medium	5	23, touch 23, flat-footed 17	60	13	18	16				30 ft., swim 20 ft.	mwk dagger +10 (1d4/19-20)		5 ft.	5 ft.	stunning glance	Str 10, Dex 21, Con 18, Int 16, Wis 17,  Cha 25	4	9	27	PFRPG Bestiary	Blinding Beauty (Su) This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet of a nymph. Those who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Inspiration (Su) A nymph can choose an intelligent creature to inspire and serve as a muse by giving that creature some token of her affection (typically a lock of her hair).  As long as the nymph retains her favor for this creature and as long as the creature carries the nymph's token, the creature gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. A bard who has a nymph for a muse in this way can use his bardic performance for an additional number of rounds per day equal to his nymph muse's Charisma modifier. The nymph retains a link to her token and its carrier as if she had cast a status spell on the carrier. The nymph can end this effect at any time as a free action. A single nymph may only inspire one creature at a time in this manner.  Spells A nymph casts spells as a 7th-level druid, but cannot swap out prepared spells to cast summon spells.  Stunning Glance (Su) As a standard action, a nymph can stun a creature within 30 feet with a look. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Unearthly Grace (Su) A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.  Wild Empathy (Su) This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except the nymph has a +6 racial bonus on the check. The nymph's effective druid level is equal to her HD for determining her total modifer to the check.

After this limit, she takes 1 point of Constitution damage each hour until immersed in salt water.  Water Magic (Su) An oceanid can use her spell-like abilities only when she is in the ocean or within 1 mile of the ocean.  Water Telekinesis (Su) When immersed in water, an oceanid can manipulate water to affect creatures and objects within 500 feet that are in contact with the same body of water. This functions as the combat maneuver form of the telekinesis spell (caster level 9th, combat maneuver bonus +14), including the need to maintain concentration. This ability also allows her to create a small waterspout as a standard action once per round, striking an opponent within 100 feet with a blast of water as a ranged attack that deals 7d6 points of bludgeoning damage.  Waveglide (Su) An oceanid can create waves and currents to double or halve the speed of creatures or objects traveling on the surface of the water, affecting up to 100 contiguous 5-foot squares in a shapeable area (typically enough for one warship or two small sailing ships). This ability has a range of 1,000 feet, requires line of effect to some part of the area, and lasts as long as the oceanid concentrates. An unwilling target can ignore the effect for 1 round by succeeding at a DC 19 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops, and once per week the oracular cyclops can apply this ability to one creature of her choosing. The target of this boon must be within 30 feet of the oracular cyclops and be able to be seen.  Protective Foresight (Su) An oracular cyclops can peer into the future to protect itself. This ability grants the cyclops a +4 insight bonus to AC.

Its claws infect targets with bubonic plague, and any willing contact with its skin (such as through caressing, grappling, or more) exposes victims to the shakes.  Bubonic Plague: Claw-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day; frequency 1/ day; effect 1d4 Str damage, 1 Cha  damage, and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Shakes: Contact; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d8 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Lustful Dreams (Su) Pairakas can torment sleeping creatures. While an intelligent creature sleeps, a pairaka can slip into the target's mind and twist its dreams to lusty nocturnal visions. The victim must be asleep for the pairaka to use this ability and the pairaka must be within 100 feet. If the victim fails a DC 21 Will save, it experiences vivid hallucinations of a lurid nature that leave it breathless and fatigued upon waking. The victim, even a depraved soul, rarely considers the sexual nature of these dreams enjoyable, as the images exploit any number of taboos the pairaka suspects its victim might harbor. The save DC is Charisma-based. Creatures that do not sleep or dream are immune to this effect.																												
Pestilential Cadaver	7.00	3200	Medium	1	19, touch 11, flat-footed 18	64	2	3	2				30 ft.	2 slams +12 (1d8+3 plus sickness)		5 ft.	5 ft.	disease aura, sickness	Str 16, Dex 12, Con -, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 12	8	11	22	Tome of Horrors 4	Disease Aura (Ex) A pestilential cadaver exudes a putrid aura in a 30-foot radius around itself. Creatures entering or caught in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract one of the diseases listed on the table below. A creature that saves is immune to the disease aura of that pestilential cadaver for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  1D8 DISEASE  1 Blinding sickness  2 Cackle fever  3 Filth fever  4 Mindfire  5 Red ache  6 Shakes  7 Slimy doom  8 Roll twice, ignoring any results of 8  Fast Healing (Ex) A pestilential cadaver's fast healing only works if it is within 30 feet of a fresh corpse. A fresh corpse is defined as any living creature killed within the last 24 hours.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A pestilential cadaver is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: A magical attack that deals fire damage dazes a pestilential cadaver (as the daze spell) for 3 rounds (no save). A magical attack that inflicts disease heals the cadaver of 1d6 hit points per level of the spellcaster. A remove disease spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a pestilential cadaver. The creature can attempt a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half. A heal spell functions as a harm spell against a pestilential cadaver.  Sickness (Ex) A living creature hit by a pestilential cadaver's slam attack must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become sickened for 2d6 rounds. A creature that fails its save by 5 or more is must immediately attempt another DC 15 Fortitude save or be subjected to one of the diseases above just as if it had been affected by the cadaver's aura. A creature that succeeds on the second Fortitude save is not subject to the disease effects of this ability for one day, even if it fails any subsequent Fortitude saves by 5 or more. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This ability is always active and can be dispelled, but the protector can restart it as a free action on its next turn.  Know Alignment (Su) A protector automatically knows the alignment of any creature within 50 feet that it looks upon.

When you use this ability, you lose your resistance bonus granted by the Protection domain for 1 minute.  Touch of Law (Sp) You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, infusing it with the power of divine order and allowing it to treat all attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round as if the natural d20 roll resulted in an 11.

Undead created by this ability are not immediately under the control of a pukwudgie, but they receive a -4 penalty on saves against a pukwudgie's control undead spell-like ability.  Poison (Su) Claw or quill-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Quills (Ex) A pukwudgie can fire two of its quills as a ranged attack as a standard action. These quills have a range increment of 40 feet. Any creature attacking a pukwudgie with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons, or an unarmed strike takes 1d3 points of piercing damage. A creature that grapples a pukwudgie takes 2d4 points of piercing damage. Anyone who takes damage from these quills is also exposed to the pukwudgie's poison.

This smell comforts and distracts humanoids and animals that come within 15 feet of the qallupilluk, causing such creatures to take a -2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting effects.  Curse of Scales (Su) If a qallupilluk grapples a Medium or Small humanoid opponent, her target begins transforming into an aquatic monster. Starting on the third consecutive round of grappling, the grappled target must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save every round or fully transform into a grindylow (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 148), reefclaw (Bestiary 2 234), bunyip (Bestiary 2 50), merrow (Bestiary 2 189), or scrag (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 268). Once fully transformed, the creature is slavishly devoted to the qallupilluk that created it. If the qallupilluk is slain, the creature loses this devotion but remains transformed. The transformation ends after 1 hour or if the creature is slain. A qallupilluk can make this transformation permanent by performing a ritual that takes 10 minutes and deals 30 points of damage to the qallupilluk. This is a curse and polymorph effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

On a failed save, the infested creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage per round as the rot grubs burrow through and consume its flesh-this effect continues as long as the victim remains in the swarm and continues for 1d6 rounds after it leaves the swarm. Any energy-based attack (including damage from negative energy) that deals at least 5 points of damage to the victim automatically destroys all of the rot grubs infesting it, ending the effect prematurely. Additionally, any effect that removes disease instantly ends a rot grub infestation. Immunity to disease offers no defense. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Salikotal	7.00	3200	Medium	10	23, touch 17, flat-footed 16	76	9	12	7		18		30 ft., fly 60 ft.

At the beginning of each day, it determines an individual to serve as its target and which one of its three vengeances it may make use of that day. It may not change this target or ability until the next day. The target may be any specific creature the salikotal knows of, even if it has not seen its target before. This target is treated as being known to a salikotal for the purposes of using its locate creature ability, even if the devil has never seen its victim before. Sneak Attack (Ex) Anytime a salikotal's opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, or if a salikotal flanks his opponent, he deals an extra 3d6 points of damage. This ability is just like the rogue's sneak attack and subject to the same limitations. Suicide (Su) As a standard action, a salikotal may target itself with a coup de grace attack. If the salikotal reduces itself to fewer than 0 hit points-or fails to do so but still fails the associated Fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage dealt)-the salikotal erupts in a burst of destructive energy. Any creature within 15 feet of a salikotal that commits suicide is damaged by a blast of metal shards and needle-like scales, taking 6d6 points of damage (DC 17, save for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon using this ability, a salikotal is permanently destroyed. This effect only takes place if a salikotal willingly ends its own life, not if it is killed by outside effects. Vengeance (Su) While seeking a victim a salikotal prepares itself daily, honing its will to effectively slaughter its intended quarry. On a given day, chosen as part of its contract killer ability, a salikotal may gain the benefit of any one of the following powers, either the one it feels will most aid it or whichever one its summoner requests. Only one of these abilities is active on a given day, and it only comes into effect when a salikotal kills its intended target with a coup de grace. These executions only function on living creatures. Fideicide: The victim's soul is immediately shunted to a infernal prison on Erebus, the third layer of Hell. The soul can be returned to life, but upon casting the spell, the spellcaster attempting the resurrection takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 x the victim's number of Hit Dice, and must make an immediate concentration check (DC 10 + damage delt + spell level) or lose the spell. Necrocide: After 1d4 rounds, the victim's body animates as a zombie under the salikotal's control. The devil may permanently grant control of the zombie to any sentient creature as a free action. Omnicide: The victim's body is utterly destroyed, disintegrating without a trace. Its clothing and possessions remain unharmed. Only spells that do not require a portion of the corpse may return the victim to life.

If the target fails its saving throw, the sangoi gains the benefit of aid (caster level equal to the target's Hit Dice). In addition, a sangoi gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, and opposed skill checks against any creature affected by its curse of misery. A creature that successfully saves can not be affected by the same sangoi's curse for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Curse of Misery: Touch-contact; save Will DC 19; frequency 1 day; effect permanent crushing despair.  Hear Heartbeat (Ex) A sangoi can hear the beating hearts of living creatures nearby, granting it blindsense 30 feet and blindsight 5 feet; it can locate all creatures taking bleed damage within 30 feet as if it had blindsight. This ability does not reveal the location of creatures without hearts, including elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and incorporeal creatures.  Horrific Critical (Ex) When a sangoi enters a blood rage, its claws and teeth elongate and sharpen, threatening a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 (in addition to the other benefits of blood rage). If a sangoi reduces a humanoid to -1 or fewer hit points with a critical hit from one of its natural weapons, it can tear out the target's heart and consume it as a free action (Fortitude DC 19 negates), killing it instantly. If successful, the sangoi gains 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. Any humanoid within 30 feet who witnesses this attack must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become shaken and sickened for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Sideways Glance (Su) Sangois fade from view when in a creature's peripheral vision. They automatically gain concealment against creatures that they flank with another creature (another sangoi or otherwise). They can also attempt a Bluff check to feint in combat as a swift action, but only against a foe that can clearly see them.  Sunlight Transparency (Ex) Direct sunlight causes a sangoi to partially fade from view. Their bodies become almost transparent (20% miss chance), and they become fatigued and take a -10 penalty on Disguise checks as long as they remain in direct sunlight.

Attacking with a weapon that provides reach allows a creature to avoid taking this damage.  Entropic Touch (Ex) A sceaduinar's natural attacks can strike incorporeal creatures as if they were ghost touch weapons. All of a sceaduinar's natural attacks deal +1d6 points of negative energy damage to the target. This energy does not heal creatures healed by inflict spells.  Void Child (Ex) Sceaduinars are immune to effects that target souls (such as trap the soul) or require knowledge of a creature's identity (such as scrying). When one is slain, it cannot be restored to life by magic save by a miracle or wish, or by divine intervention.

The serpopard must begin and end this movement in an area of dunes. Using this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  Far Wanderer (Ex) Knowledge (geography) and Survival are class skills for serpopards.  Limber Neck (Ex) A serpopard can use its long neck to make bite attacks as part of a rake attack against grappled opponents.

A shadow demon caught in such light cannot attack and can take only a single move or standard action. A shadow demon that is possessing a creature using magic jar is not harmed by sunlight, but if it is struck by a sunbeam or sunburst spell while possessing a creature, the shadow demon is driven out of its host automatically.

It takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls against airborne or waterborne opponents. Metalmorph (Su) As a standard action, a shaitan may touch a single metal object of no more than 10 pounds and transform it into any other metal for 1 day. Stone Curse (Su) If a shaitan wins a bull rush check by 5 or more and pushes its target into a stone barrier, the target must make a DC 19 Reflex save or be forced into the barrier as if the target had cast meld into stone until the victim makes a successful DC 19 Fortitude save as a full-round action to exit the stone. The save DCs are Strength-based. Stone Glide (Su) This functions as the earth elemental's earth glide ability, except the shaitan can move through stone, dirt, crystal, or metal.																												
Shark-Eating Crab	7.00	3200	Huge	2	20, touch 10, flat-footed 18	84	12	4	3				30 ft., swim 60 ft.	2 claws +13 (1d8+9 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	constrict (1d8+9), darting claw	Str 29, Dex 14, Con 22, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 2	6	+17 (+21 grapple)	29 (41 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Darting Claw (Ex) Evolved for snatching fast prey, a shark-eating crab is exceptionally quick with its claws. When making a full attack, if a shark-eating crab misses with both of its claw attacks, it can make an additional claw attack at a -2 penalty against any creature within its reach.

Str 19, Dex 21, Con -, Int -, Wis 23, Cha 16	7	12	27	AP 57	Salted Wound (Su) Any living creature damaged by a ship sentinel must make a successful DC 16 Fortitude save or take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls for 1 round as salty brine drips painfully onto the wound. On a successful critical hit, the target takes an additional 3d6 points of damage as its flesh cracks and withers from dehydration. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Ship Sight (Su) A ship sentinel is treated as having tremorsense out to 100 feet while onboard a ship, as its senses permeate the vessel's timbers. It can only detect creatures in contact with the vessel or on objects in contact with the vessel. It cannot use this ability to detect creatures not in contact with the ship, even if they are within the ability's 100-foot radius.																												
Shoggti	7.00	3200	Large	7	21, touch 12, flat-footed 18	80	11	5	9	uncanny dodge			30 ft.	bite +12 (1d8+6), 4 tentacles +8 (1d4+3 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	braincloud, horrific appearance (DC 15), constrict (1d4+6)	Str 22, Dex 16, Con 23, Int 12, Wis 19, Cha 15	7	+14 (+18 grapple)	27 (31 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Braincloud (Su) Once per round, in place of a melee attack with a tentacle, a shoggti can make a melee touch attack with the pincer on the end of that tentacle. If it hits, the target takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Shoggti use this ability to mentally debilitate their victims so they can more easily use their charm spell-like abilities against them.  Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to a shoggti's horrific appearance become fascinated by the creature's hypnotically wriggling tentacles and the strange, shimmering colors in its eyes. This effect persists for 1d6 rounds (but can be ended by the normal methods of defeating the fascinated condition).																												
Slag Giant	7.00	3200	Large	1	20, touch 10, flat-footed 19	85	11	6	4	rock catching			40 ft.	warhammer +15/+10 (2d6+12/x3) or 2 slams +14 (1d8+8)	rock +8 (1d8+8)	10 ft.	10 ft.	rock throwing (120 ft.)

Soul Eater	7.00	3200	Medium	10	21, touch 17, flat-footed 14	82	5	13	7				30 ft., fly 100 ft. (perfect)	2 claws +18  (1d6+1/19-20 plus 1d6  Wisdom damage)		5 ft.	5 ft.	find target, soul drain	Str 13, Dex 22,  Con 14, Int 12,  Wis 11, Cha 11	11	12	29 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Caster Link (Ex) When a soul eater is summoned, it creates a mental link between itself and its conjurer. If the soul eater's assigned target (see find target ability) dies before the soul eater can drain its soul, or if the soul eater is defeated by its target (but not slain), it returns to its conjurer at full speed and attacks her. While the soul eater and the conjurer are on the same plane (regardless of plane-traveling interruptions), it can use its find target ability to locate its conjurer.  Find Target (Su) When a soul eater's conjurer orders it to find a creature, it can do so unerringly, as though guided by a locate creature spell that has no maximum range and is not blocked by running water. The conjurer must have seen the desired target and must speak the target's name.  Soul Drain (Su) If the Wisdom damage from a soul eater's claw attacks equals or exceeds an opponent's actual Wisdom score, rendering the victim helpless, the soul eater can devour that creature's soul as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This attack kills the victim. The dead victim can resist having her soul eaten by making a (DC 17) Fortitude save; success means she is still dead, but can be restored to life normally. If she fails this save, her soul is consumed by the soul eater. A victim slain in this manner cannot be returned to life with clone, raise dead, or reincarnation. She can be restored to life via resurrection, true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but only if the caster can succeed on a DC 30 caster level check. If the soul eater is killed within 120 feet of its victim's corpse, and the victim has been dead for no longer than 1 minute, the victim's soul returns to her body and restores her to life, leaving her unconscious and at - 1 hit point. This is a death effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Wisdom Damage (Su) A creature hit by a soul eater's claw must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Soul Eater	7.00	3200	Medium	6	25, touch 17, flat-footed 18	75	9	13	3				fly 100 ft., (perfect)	2 claws +16 (1d6+1/19-20 plus 1d6 Wis damage)		5 ft.	5 ft.	soul drain, Wisdom damage	Str 13, Dex 22, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 11, Cha 11	10	11	28 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Find Target (Sp) When ordered to find a creature, a soul eater does so unerringly, as though guided by discern location. The being giving the order must have seen the creature to be found and must know the target's name. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. Link to Caster (Ex) When a soul eater is summoned to the Material Plane, it creates a mental link between itself and the caster who summoned it. If a soul eater's victim (i.e., the creature it is summoned to slay) is killed before the creature can devour its soul, the soul eater returns at full speed to the caster and attacks him. Likewise, if a soul eater is defeated in battle (but not slain) by its target, the creature returns to the caster and attacks him. So long as both the caster and soul eater are on the same plane of existence, the soul eater can successfully locate the caster (again as though guided by discern location). If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster returns, or the soul eater enters a plane the caster is on, the link is immediately restored. Soul Drain (Su) When a soul eater slays a foe, it devours the victim's soul. Such a creature cannot be returned to life by any means save a deity's intervention. Wisdom Damage (Su) A creature hit by a soul eater's claw attack must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature brought to Wisdom 0 dies.																												
Soulbound Mannequin	7.00	3200	Medium	7	19, touch 13, flat-footed 16	85	3	6	3			susceptible to mind-affecting effects	30 ft.	2 claws +15 (1d8+4 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	constrict (1d8+4)	Str 18, Dex 16, Con -, Int 11, Wis 10, Cha 9	10	+14 (+18 grapple)	27	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Alignment Variation (Ex) Soulbound mannequins are at least partially neutral in alignment, although they can also be chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. They have an alignment-dependent spell-like ability usable once per day as listed below. • Chaotic Neutral: confusion (DC 13) • Lawful Neutral: fear (DC 13) • Neutral: hold monster (DC 13) • Neutral Evil: enervation • Neutral Good: greater invisibility  Disguise Self (Sp) The soulbound mannequin can only disguise itself as the living person it used to be at approximately the age it was when its soul was used to make the mannequin (this allows it to take the appearance of another creature type).  Soul Focus (Su) The soul bound to the mannequin lives within a focus integrated into the doll or its apparel, typically a carved mask. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another mannequin, at the same cost as creating a new soulbound mannequin. The new mannequin retains its personality and memories. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.  Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) Unlike most constructs, a soulbound mannequin is not immune to mind-affecting effects.																												
Spectre	7.00	3200	Medium	7	15, touch 15, flat-footed 12	52	4	5	9	incorporeal, channel resistance +2		resurrection vulnerability, sunlight powerlessness	fly 80 ft. (perfect)	incorporeal touch +10 (1d8 plus energy drain)		5 ft.	5 ft.	create spawn, energy drain (2 levels, DC 16)	Str -, Dex 16, Con -, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 15	6	6	21	PFRPG Bestiary	Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoids slain by a spectre become spectres themselves in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical spectres, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive -2 hp per HD, and only drain one level on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the spectre that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed spectres. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a spectre destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) Spectres are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. A spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered. Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a spectre at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so as long as it is within 30 feet of the spectre.																												
Spellscar Fext	7.00	3200	Medium	7	19, touch 13, flat-footed 16	85	7	6	8		18	vulnerable to glass	30 ft.	2 slams +14 (1d6+7/18-20)		5 ft.	5 ft.	deadly slam, dispelling critical	Str 25, Dex 16, Con -, Int 8, Wis 13, Cha 19	7	14	27	Inner Sea Bestiary	Deadly Slam (Ex) A Spellscar fext threatens a critical hit with its slam attack on rolls of 18-20.  Dispelling Critical (Su) Whenever a Spellscar fext successfully scores a critical hit with its slam attack, the creature struck must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by the targeted dispel version of a dispel magic spell (caster level 10th). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Ravage Magic (Su) Any targeted spell or spell-like ability that fails to penetrate a Spellscar fext's spell resistance is absorbed by the fext and warped into a form of primal magic. A Spellscar fext can twist only a number of spell levels per round equal to its Charisma modifier (4 for most Spellscar fexts); any spells in excess of this limit automatically bypass a Spellscar fext's spell resistance and don't trigger this ability. Roll on the following table to determine the effect of a spell that has been affected by a Spellscar fext's ravage magic ability. Alternatively, a Spellscar mutant may use any of the sample primal magic events found effects with the CR of the Spellscar fext.  d% Effect  01-40 The spell has no effect.  41-70 The Spellscar fext emits a burst of negative energy, dealing a number of points of negative energy damage equal to 1d6 x the spell level of the triggering spell to all creatures in a 30-foot-radius burst.  71-90 The Spellscar fext instantly switches places with the spellcaster that targeted the fext with the triggering spell as though by dimension door.  91-100 The spell is immediately turned back on its caster via spell turning.  Vulnerable to Glass (Ex) A Spellscar fext's hide is particularly vulnerable to the penetrations of glass and glass-based weapons. Spellscar fexts take 150% as much damage as normal from glass-headed piercing or slashing weapons.																												
Spire Drake	7.00	3200	Large	1	20, touch 10, flat-footed 19	84	10	7	6				30 ft., climb 30 ft., fly 60 ft.

The attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 5d6 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 18 half) to all creatures in a 20-foot radius. Affected creatures take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1d4 rounds (or for 1 round on a successful Will save). As long as these motes cling to a creature, the effect of any conjuration (healing) effect used on that creature is halved. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Soul Corruption (Su) If a spire drake successfully performs a coup de grace upon a creature afflicted by its accursed breath, the slain target arises 1d4 rounds later as a wight (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 276). This wight is not under the drake's control, and the wight and any spawn that it creates perish 1d6 days after arising.  Speed Surge (Su) Three times per day as a swift action, a spire drake can draw on its draconic reserves for a boost of strength and speed, allowing it to take an additional move action in that round.																												
Steam Hog	7.00	3200	Huge	4	19, touch 8, flat-footed 19	94	10	6	6	ferocity			30 ft., burrow 10 ft.	gore +14 (2d6+7 plus 1d6 fire), 2 hooves +9 (1d8+3)		15 ft.	10 ft.	steam cloud, trample (1d8+10, DC 21)	Str 24, Dex 11, Con 18, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 9	9	18	28 (32 vs. trip)	Monster Codex	Steam Cloud (Ex) As a standard action, a steam hog can emit a cloud of steam from its snout in a 10-foot-radius spread. The initial burst of steam deals 2d6 points of fire damage to any creature in the area. The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds once created, acting as a 10-foot-radius obscuring mist. Any creature that begins its turn in the area of the steam must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. A steam hog can use its steam cloud only once every 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Stegosaurus	7.00	3200	Huge	6	22, touch 10, flat-footed 20	90	13	10	5				30 ft.	tail +16 (4d6+12 plus trip)		15 ft.	15 ft.		Str 27, Dex 14, Con 17, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 10	9	19	31 (35 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary

This attack has a range of 100 feet and deals 7d6 points of electricity damage (DC 18 Reflex half) to all creatures within a 20-foot radius spread. Once a storm drake has used its lightning breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Savage Bite (Ex) A storm drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a storm drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.  Storm Vision (Ex) A storm drake can see through fog, clouds, and similar obscuring effects with perfect clarity, including areas affected by spells such as obscuring mist and fog cloud.																												
Storm Hag	7.00	3200	Medium	2	21, touch 13, flat-footed 18	85	6	9	8		18		30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Thus, she could sniff out a child's hiding place or a den of wolf pups, but not the child's parents or the den mother.  Storm Rider (Su) A storm hag is considered two size categories larger than she actually is in regard to wind effects.  Storm Strike (Su) Each time a storm hag makes a successful attack with her bite, claws, or when she uses a weapon that is predominantly made of metal the attack deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage.  Whipping Winds (Su) As a standard action, a storm hag can use her gust of wind spell-like ability to trip her foes. This ability can only affect one target within 30 feet, and the storm hag uses her combat maneuver bonus as if tripping a creature normally. The gust of wind spell doesn't possess its normal effects, but instead sweeps a creature off its feet. Attempting to trip a creature with this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity, but casting the spell-like ability provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.																												
Stygira	7.00	3200	Medium	7	19, touch 13, flat-footed 16	76	6	9	14		18	light blindness	30 ft.	2 claws +11 (1d4+3 plus stone curse)		5 ft.	5 ft.	gem gaze, stone curse	Str 17, Dex 16, Con 18, Int 17, Wis 22, Cha 15	8	11	24	AP 33	Gem Eye (Su) Stygiras possess a special connection with gemstones. While holding or otherwise in contact with a gemstone of at least the size of a human eye, a stygira can see through the gemstone like a magical eye, viewing her surroundings as if her blindsense extended to 120 feet and she were under the effects of true seeing, which grants her a +4 bonus on Perception checks. Gem Gaze (Su) Shaken for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. A stygira can only make use of this ability while holding a gemstone. Light Blindness Despite their effective blindness, stygiras remain sensitive to light. Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds stygiras for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. Stone Curse (Su) Any creature struck by a stygira's claws must make a DC 18 Will save or be affected by a curse that gradually drains it of color, stiffens its joints, and finally turns the victim to stone. This curse proves frighteningly unpredictable, forcing another save against its effects every 1d3 hours. Any creature that is drained to 0 Dexterity or fails three saves against the curse is permanently petrified. Even if a creature is petrified and then restored to flesh, it is still affected by the curse and is petrified again upon failing its next save against the curse. A stone curse can only be removed in one of two ways: by casting remove curse or by spending a full hour in unobstructed natural sunlight. Magical radiance like daylight does not affect a stone curse, and remove curse does not return a petrified creature to flesh. The save DC is Constitution-based. Stone curse: Claw-curse; save Will DC 18; frequency 1/1d3 hours; effect 1d6 Dex damage, failing 3 saves results in petrification; cure casting remove curse or spending 1 hour in natural sunlight																												
Succubus	7.00	3200	Medium	3	20, touch 13, flat-footed 17	84	7	9	10		18		30 ft., fly 50 ft. (average)	2 claws +11 (1d6+1)		5 ft.	5 ft.	energy drain, profane gift	Str 13, Dex 17, Con 20, Int 18, Wis 14, Cha 27	8	11	22	PFRPG Bestiary	Energy Drain (Su) A succubus drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before the succubus can use this ability. The succubus's kiss bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another act of passion from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 22 Will save to negate the suggestion. The DC is 22 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based. Profane Gift (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a succubus may grant a profane gift to a willing humanoid creature by touching it for 1 full round. The target gains a +2 profane bonus to an ability score of his choice. A single creature may have no more than one profane gift from a succubus at a time. As long as the profane gift persists, the succubus can communicate telepathically with the target across any distance (and may use her suggestion spell-like ability through it). A profane gift is removed by dispel evil or dispel chaos. The succubus can remove it as well as a free action (causing 2d6 Charisma drain to the victim, no save).																												
Suspiridaemon	7.00	3200	Medium	7	20, touch 14, flat-footed 16	85	9	9	8		18		30 ft.	2 claws +13 (1d4+4), tongue +8 (1d6+6/19-20 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.

Every creature within 30 feet must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 5d6 points of sonic damage and become sickened  for 1d4 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save takes only half damage and is not sickened. A suspiridaemon cannot perform this ability if it is currently grappling a creature with its tongue. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Strangle (Ex) Suspiridaemons have an unerring talent for seizing their victims by the neck. A creature that is grappled by a suspiridaemon cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.  Suffocate (Ex) A creature affected by the daemon's strangle ability cannot breathe and must hold its breath. Because of the daemon's thin air aura, this can quickly render an opponent unconscious.  Thin Air (Su) A suspiridaemon's aura makes the air around it difficult to breathe. Creatures that need to breathe can only hold their breath half as long as normal while within this aura, and suffer from altitude sickness as if in a low peak or high pass (see Altitude Zones, Core Rulebook 430).																												
Tallow Golem	7.00	3200	Medium	-1	18, touch 9, flat-footed 18	75	3	2	21			vulnerability to fire	20 ft.	2 slams +13 (2d8+3 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	chemisorb	Str 16, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	10	36	59	Tome of Horrors Complete	Chemisorb (Ex) A tallow golem can break down and absorb chemicals from a living victim by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the pin is maintained. Additionally, this causes skin discoloration. The victim must make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Charisma drain. Whether the save succeeds or fails, that victim cannot be affected again by the skin discoloration of that tallow golem's chemisorb attack for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Tendrul	7.00	3200	Large	2	21, touch 12, flat-footed 18	76	6	5	8				10 ft.	bite +10 (1d8+5 plus grab), tail slap +5 (1d6+2)		10 ft.	5 ft.	constrict (1d8+5), gnashing of teeth	Str 21, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 3, Wis 12, Cha 6	6	13	26 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Gnashing of Teeth (Ex) If a tendrul scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with its bite attack and subsequently confirms the critical hit, it deals triple normal damage.  Keen Scent (Ex) A tendrul notices creatures by scent in a 90-foot radius and detects blood in the water at ranges of up to 500 feet.																												
Theletos	7.00	3200	Medium	6	20, touch 15, flat-footed 17	76	9	5	7		18		30 ft., fly 30 ft. (poor)	2 slams +13 (1d6+4), 2 tentacles +8 (1d4+2 plus fate drain)		5 ft.	5 ft.	wreath of fate	Str 18, Dex 14, Con 17, Int 11, Wis 19,  Cha 12	9	7	21	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Fate Drain (Su) A theletos possesses a pair of flexible crystalline tentacles with which it can drain a creature's sense of fate and destiny. Whenever it strikes a foe with these tentacles, the creature struck must make a DC 17 Will save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage.  Until a creature's Charisma damage from this ability is healed, the victim takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws (regardless of the actual total amount of Charisma damage it takes). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Wreath of Fate (Su) As a full-round-action every 1d4 rounds, a theletos can release a 60-foot cone of energy from its chest. Any intelligent creature struck by this cone must make a DC 15 Will save or become nearly overwhelmed with the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in store for him-there is no way to make sense of these myriad dooms and boons, and as a result, the victim is staggered. As long as this condition persists, the victim may choose to make two rolls when attempting an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check-he must accept the worse of the two rolls, but in so doing the wreath of fate passes from his soul and he is no longer staggered by this ability. Wreath of fate is a curse effect, and as such can be affected by remove curse or break enchantment-the effective caster level of this curse is equal to the theletos's HD (CL 9th in most cases). The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Tormentor Devil	7.00	3200	Medium	8	24, touch 14, flat-footed 20	76	6	10	5		18		30 ft.	#ERROR!	soulcatcher net +12 (1d6 plus grapple)	5 ft.	5 ft.	ghost touch	Str 18, Dex 18, Con 18, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 15	8	8	24 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Ghost Touch (Ex) A tormentor devil deals damage normally with its claws against incorporeal creatures.  Soul Track (Su) A tormentor devil can track the soul of any creature that enters any of the planes of Hell. Tracking a soul has a base DC of 20 and follows the rules for tracking.  A tormentor devil must be on the same plane as the soul it is tracking.  Soulcatcher Net: A tormentor devil's net looks like a normal net and follows the rules for net attacks. The net has 20 hit points; the Escape Artist check to get free is DC 30; the net can be broken with a successful DC 30 Strength check. The net can entrap incorporeal creatures.  The net has many small razor-sharp barbs lining it. These barbs deal 1d6 points of damage each round to any creature caught in the net, including incorporeal creatures.  (The incorporeal creature's 50% chance to avoid damage from a corporeal source does not apply to this attack.)																												
Totenmaske	7.00	3200	Medium	10	20, touch 16, flat-footed 14	85	7	9	2				50 ft.	bite +13 (1d8+4 plus 1d4 Cha drain), 2 claws +13 (1d6+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	fleshdrink, shape flesh	Str 18, Dex 23, Con -, Int 16, Wis 15, Cha 19	7	10	21	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Charisma Drain (Su) A totenmaske can eat the hopes and dreams of a creature it bites, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma drain unless the victim makes a DC 21 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Fleshdrink (Su) If a totenmaske hits a single creature with both claw attacks, the hollow claws drain away some of the target's flesh, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage and making the victim sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 19 Fortitude save negates the Constitution damage and reduces the sickened condition duration to 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shape Flesh (Su) By spending 1 minute in contact with a helpless creature, a totenmaske can reshape the target's face, causing flesh to cover vital features. The target may attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save to resist. Changes are permanent, but can be reversed with heal, restoration, or regeneration, or by surgically opening the sealed flesh with a DC 15 Heal check that takes 1d3 rounds and deals 1d4 points of damage even if the check is not successful. A totenmaske can use this ability on one of four different features per use: ears (target becomes deaf ), eyes (target becomes blind), mouth (target cannot speak or eat), or nose (target cannot smell). Multiple uses can have increasingly serious effects (such as sealing the mouth and nose, which causes suffocation). The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Tunnel Worm	7.00	3200	Huge	1	16, touch 9, flat-footed 15	112	12	9	5				20 ft., burrow 20 ft.	bite +14 (2d6+9 plus grab)		15 ft.	10 ft.	rend armor	Str 22, Dex 13, Con 22, Int 1, Wis 10, Cha 6	9	+17 (+21 grappling)	28 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Rend Armor (Ex) If a tunnel worm grapples an opponent wearing armor, it attempts to chew away the armor with its powerful mandibles. With a successful grapple check it deals double its regular bite damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.																												
Tupilaq	7.00	3200	Small	4	20, touch 15, flat-footed 16	59	3	7	3				30 ft., swim 60 ft.	bite +15 (1d8+10/19-20 plus grab), 2 claws +15 (1d4+5)		5 ft.	5 ft.	seek target, shearing jaws	Str 21, Dex 18, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 5	9	+13 (+17 grapple)	27	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Scrimshaw Magic (Sp) When a tupilaq is created, its creator can inscribe a single spell he knows (as long as that spell is no higher than 2nd level and requires no material components) into the tupilaq as a complex scrimshaw design. The tupilaq gains the ability to use that spell as a spell-like ability (CL 7th) three times per day. The tupilaq's creator can inscribe a new spell onto the tupilaq if he wishes, replacing the previous scrimshaw. Inscribing a new scrimshaw requires 24 hours of work and an expenditure of 500 gp in materials. The tupilaq presented here utilizes invisibility in this manner. Erase can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator becomes  the target of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case. If a tupilaq's creator is already dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out the nearest living creature and attacks this new target on sight, continuing this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed.  Seek Target (Su) A tupilaq's creator can place a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body in the tupilaq's maw as a standard action. From that point on, the tupilaq constantly knows what direction that creature is located in, and gains a +20 insight bonus on all Perception checks made to locate the creature. A new target cannot be assigned to a tupilaq in this manner until its previous target is dead.  Shearing Jaws (Ex) All tupilaqs are crafted with oversized jaws capable of tearing and pulling. A tupilaq applies twice its Strength modifier to damage with a successful bite attack and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A tupilaq is treated as Large for all checks made to move a grappled opponent.																												
Two-headed Troll	7.00	3200	Large	0	16, touch 9, flat-footed 16	95	11	3	5				30 ft.	longsword +12/+7 (2d6+6), longsword +12/+7 (2d6+6), 2 bites +7 (1d8+3) or 2 claws +12 (1d6+6 ), 2 bites +12 (1d8+6)		10 ft.	10 ft.	rend (2 claws, 1d6+9), superior two-weapon fighting	Str 22, Dex 11, Con 19, Int 9, Wis 10, Cha 6	7	14	24	Tome of Horrors Complete	Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex) A two-headed troll fights with a weapon in each hand. Because each of its two heads controls an arm, the two-headed troll does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.																												
Ugothokra	7.00	3200	Small	9	20, touch 17, flat-footed 14	85	7	8	10	infected blood			50 ft., climb 50 ft.	bite +9 (1d4+1 plus poison)	6 flechette spray +13 (1d4+1 plus viral infection)	5 ft.	5 ft.	combined arms	Str 13, Dex 20, Con 18, Int 10, Wis 17, Cha 13	7	7	23 (35 vs. trip)	AP 88	Combined Arms (Ex) When taking a full-attack action, an ugothokra can attack with its bite and its flechette spray attacks simultaneously. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity with its flechette spray attacks when using combined arms.  Expert Climber (Ex) An ugothokra's feet allow it to climb any surface, no matter how slick or sheer. In effect, an ugothokra is treated as constantly being under the effects of spider climb, though this is effect is natural rather than magical.  Flechette Spray (Ex) An ugothokra can fire bursts of calcified bone and horn from the vents along its abdomen. All six vents can fire as part of a full-attack action, or it can fire one vent as a standard action. This attack has a range increment of 50 feet. An ugothokra generates the "ammunition" it uses for this attack internally by feeding on organic material, and effectively has an unlimited supply of flechette material at any one time, but an ugothokra that is currently starving can't use this attack until at least 1 hour after feeding.  Infected Blood (Ex) A creature that damages an ugothokra with a slashing or piercing melee weapon (regardless of how often the ugothokra is damaged) must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw at the end of its turn or be sprayed by the ugothokra's infected blood. A creature that damages an ugothokra with a slashing or piercing natural weapon automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature is exposed to a random viral infection (see below), but gains a +4 bonus on the Fortitude save to resist contracting whatever disease it is exposed to. Unlike when a victim contracts an infection from an ugothokra's flechette spray, diseases caught via contact with the monster's blood have normal onset times as determined by the disease in question. The Reflex save is Dexterity-based.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con plus sickened for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Viral Infection (Su) An ugothokra's body is infested with numerous potent and highly infectious diseases engineered by their Dominion creators to cause highly specific conditions in those they infect. An ugothokra's blood carries these diseases, and while the creature can transmit random infections by means of contact with its blood, the most efficient method of transmission is via its flechette spray. Most ugothokras carry the following three contagions in their systems, and they can decide which one to inflict on a target as part of the act of firing a flechette spray-it can even inflict different diseases with different sprays in the same round if it so chooses. Some ugothokras carry additional viral infections that are tailored by their Dominion creators for incredibly specialized tasks. A creature exposed to any of these viral infections can resist the infection with a successful DC 19 Fortitude save, but on a failed save, the effect occurs immediately and the onset time is ignored. Contracting an infection via the ugothokra's blood is not as efficient and uses the listed onset time. The most common viral infections available to an ugothokra are listed below.  Aklo Submission: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Wisdom drain (can't drain Wisdom below 0) plus susceptibility to Aklo; cure 2 consecutive saves. As long as a creature is infected with this disease (even if the creature isn't currently suffering any Wisdom drain from the disease), it becomes unusually compliant and responsive to commands issued to it in Aklo. Any Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check attempted against the character while speaking in Aklo gains a +4 bonus. Furthermore, as a full-round action, any creature can issue a command to the victim in Aklo to attempt to affect the victim with a suggestion effect (effective CL 5th, regardless of the commander's level)-the victim can resist this suggestion with a successful DC 14 Will save. Once a victim of Aklo submission succeeds at a Will save to resist such a suggestion, it can't be further affected in this way by any Aklo-speaking creature for 24 hours.  Flesh Ripen Fever: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage plus stench; cure 2 consecutive saves. A character suffering from flesh ripen fever exudes a nauseating stench as his skin decays and sloughs off, leaving behind reeking pits of stinking flesh. The victim is automatically sickened by its own smell, as are all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save allows a creature to ignore the sickening effect for 24 hours-the victim of flesh ripen fever doesn't get such a saving throw to avoid being sickened. This stench is a poison effect that doesn't affect creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black.  Implant Rejection Syndrome: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con drain plus 1d2 Int drain plus implant rejection; cure 2 consecutive saves. This insidious sickness is particularly devastating to creatures with cybernetic implants. Such creatures take a -2 penalty on all saving throws attempted to resist this disease. Further, each time a saving throw to resist its effect is attempted and failed, the creature takes 2d6 points of damage and loses the use of one randomly selected cybernetic implant for 24 hours.																												
Vanth	7.00	3200	Medium	3	20, touch 13, flat-footed 17	76	11	6	10		18		30 ft., fly 50 ft. (average)	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 18, Dex 16, Con 17, Int 13, Wis 19, Cha 17	9	13	26	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Fear Aura (Su) A creature of fewer than 10 Hit Dice that fails its save (DC 17) against the vanth's fear aura is shaken for as long as it remains within the aura. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that vanth's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Reaper's Scythe (Su) Every vanth carries a distinctive adamantine scythe as both a weapon and a symbol of its duty. When the vanth wields its own scythe, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. As a free action, the vanth can summon its weapon from a personal demiplane or any other location and have it appear in its hands instantly. It can also dismiss its scythe back to its personal demiplane as a free action. If a vanth's scythe is destroyed, it can summon a new one in 24 hours.																												
Very Young Blue Dragon	7.00	3200	Medium	5	19, touch 11, flat-footed 18	68	8	7	7				40 ft., burrow 20 ft., fly 150 ft.

Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 16) or be destroyed.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.																												
Very Young Bronze Dragon	7.00	3200	Medium	1	19, touch 11, flat-footed 18	68	8	7	9				40 ft., fly 150 ft.

Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.																												
Vilkacis	7.00	9600	Medium	10	19, touch 19, flat-footed 13	85	6	11	9	channel resistance +2, incorporeal, rejuvenation		vulnerability to silver	fly 50 ft. (perfect)	2 incorporeal touches +15 (1d8 plus 2d6 cold)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bestial possession, curse of lycanthropy (DC 18)	Str -, Dex 23, Con -, Int 8, Wis 14, Cha 17	7	13	26 (30 vs. trip)	AP 45	Bestial Possession (Su) A vilkacis is a spirit of savagery and can take control of other beings, afflicting them with its savage nature. Once per round, the vilkacis can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th), except it does not require a receptacle and lasts for up to 3 hours (or a number of hours equal to the vilkacis's Charisma modifier, whichever is greater). To use this ability, the vilkacis must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 18 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same vilkacis's bestial possession for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Upon being possessed by a vilkacis, the target takes on a number of bestial features, most notably growing claws and vicious fangs, and flies into a savage rage. The victim gains two claws and a bite natural attack appropriate to its size (1d4 and 1d6 for Medium creatures; see Table 3-1 on page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary), and gains a barbarian's greater rage class ability (see page 31 of the Core Rulebook).  This rage lasts for as long as the victim is being possessed by the vilkacis. After the possession ends, the victim is fatigued for a period of time equal to double the duration of the possession. The victim also gains low-light vision and scent.  The possessed creature loses all of these natural attacks and abilities immediately when the vilkacis leaves its body.  Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) Any humanoid who is bitten by a creature possessed by a vilkacis must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be infected with lycanthropy as if bitten by a werewolf. If the victim's size is not within one size category of the possessed creature's, this ability has no effect. The save DC uses the vilkacis's ability scores and is Charisma-based.  Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex) A vilkacis or creature possessed by a vilkacis can communicate and empathize with wolves and dire wolves. It can use its Diplomacy to alter such an animal's attitude, and when so doing gains a +4 racial bonus on the check.  Rejuvenation (Su) A vilkacis that is destroyed in combat restores itself after 2d4 days. The only way to permanently do away with a vilkacis is to locate its canopic stone, the occult artifact that binds it to the Material Plane, and then destroy the artifact in the presence of the vilkacis's mortal remains. Once the canopic stone is destroyed, the vilkacis can no longer rejuvenate and can be destroyed as normal.  Vulnerability to Silver (Su) Vilkacis are particularly susceptible to silver. A vilkacis struck with a silver weapon takes an additional 2d6 points of damage. If a creature under the effects of a vilkacis's bestial possession is damaged by a silver weapon, it also takes this extra damage and receives another saving throw to resist the bestial possession.  If successful, the possession ends, and the vilkacis is driven into an adjacent square and cannot use its bestial possession ability again until the following day.

Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, they are immediately destroyed. Hellstrider (Su) A levaloch is not impeded by rough terrain, and can move or charge through such squares as normal. It can also cross areas covered with deadly impediments (such as caltrops or thorns) without being damaged or hindered. In addition to being entirely immune to fire, the creature's legs are immune to acid and cold, allowing it to cross even rivers of acid or lava without being damaged or hindered as long as the material is less than 4 feet deep. This ability does not protect a levaloch against magical hindrances like black tentacles, web, or similar spells. Merciless Blow (Su) Levalochs show no mercy to the vulnerable. Any trident attacks they make against entangled creatures (including those entangled by its net) deal an extra 2d6 points damage. Phalanx (Ex) Devils gain a +1 morale bonus on attacks and to AC while adjacent to a levaloch. Stability (Ex) Levalochs receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground. Summon Devil (Sp) Once per day a levaloch can attempt to summon 1d4 lemures or 1 bearded devil with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell. Skills Levalochs have a +2 racial bonus on Stealth and Perception checks. This Stealth bonus increases to +8 when a levaloch is concealed amid metal objects or debris.

Static Discharge (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as part of a move action taken to fly at least 10 feet, a warmonger wasp's wings can discharge a bolt of electricity to a range of up to 60 feet. The bolt explodes upon reaching its target, creating a 20-foot-radius burst that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half).

These boots give the winter redcap a kick attack that it can make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full-attack action or as part of its movement, just as if it had the Spring Attack feat.  Heavy Weapons (Ex) A winter redcap can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty.  Irreligious (Ex) Bitter and blasphemous, winter redcaps cannot stand the symbols of good-aligned religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a holy symbol, any winter redcap that can see the creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become frightened for 1 minute and attempt to flee. A winter redcap who successfully saves is shaken for 1 minute.  Red Cap (Su) A winter redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a winter redcap gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls (included in the above totals) and fast healing 3. These benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. Caps are not transferable, even between other redcaps. A winter redcap can create a new cap to replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of work, but until the winter redcap takes a standard action to dip the cap in the blood of a foe the winter redcap helped to kill, the cap does not grant its bonuses.

Sandstorm (Su) An ancient or older brass dragon can create a powerful sandstorm once per day as a full-round action.

Desiccating Bite (Su) An ancient brine dragon's bite causes weakness, dealing 1d2 points of Strength drain in addition to its normal damage. A great wyrm's bite deals 1d4 points of Strength drain. A Fortitude save (DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC) negates the Strength drain.  Painful Strikes (Su) A great wyrm brine dragon's natural attacks are so laden with salt and acidic crystals that every time it strikes a creature with one of these attacks, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC) or be stunned for a round from the pain.

When a cloud dragon uses its breath weapon, make a single bull rush attack using the dragon's CMB against the CMD of any creature that failed its Reflex save and is three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. This bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the dragon cannot choose to move with any opponent pushed back. In addition to being pushed back, affected creatures are knocked prone and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back. Flying creatures are buffeted and pushed back twice the distance and sustain 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back.

An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. Breath Weapon (Su) A mist dragon's breath weapon is a cone of cloudy scalding vapor. In still air, the vapor lingers for 1d4 rounds and forms a cloud that covers a radius equal to the cone's length; on the second round, the vapor condenses into a heated smothering fog that deals 1d6 points of fire damage to creatures each round they remain in the area (Fortitude save halves this damage). The fog also blinds creatures (as the blindness spell) that fail the save as long as they remain within in the cloud and for 2 rounds after they leave the area. Mist Form (Su) As a standard action, a juvenile or older mist dragon can assume gaseous form, but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. A great wyrm mist dragon's abilities while in mist form improve drastically. As a standard action a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can make a single melee attack of its choice at its highest attack bonus. This attack deals normal damage.

In dust form, the axiomite looks like a shifting mass of glowing mathematical symbols and equations. In this form it can fly and gains the incorporeal quality; it can use spell-like abilities but cannot make physical attacks. In its solid form, an axiomite cannot fly. Both shapes are the axiomite's true form, and it does not revert to a different form if killed. A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.  Summon Inevitable (Sp) Once per day, four axiomites may join hands to summon a single zelekhut inevitable as a full-round action.																												
Azgenzak	8.00	4800	Large	3	22, touch 12, flat-footed 19	95	8	6	8	amorphous			20 ft., swim 20 ft.	3 slams +11 (1d6+4 plus burn and grab)		10 ft.	5 ft.	burn (1d6, DC 20), burning blindness, constrict (1d6+4), swallow whole (2d6 fire, AC 15, 9 hp), swarming pyrocules	Str 18, Dex 17, Con 20, Int 7, Wis 13, Cha 12	7	+12 (+16 grapple)	25	AP 69	Burning Blindness (Su) When an azgenzak confirms a critical hit or a creature fails its save against the distraction attack of its swarming pyrocules, the azgenzak attempts to pluck out one of the target's eyes (Fortitude DC 20 negates). If the save fails, the target takes 1d6 additional points of fire damage, is sickened by pain for 1d4 rounds, and becomes permanently dazzled. If this results in the loss of all of the target's eyes, it is permanently blinded.  Inversion (Ex) As a move action, an azgenzak can invert its sac-like body, turning itself inside out and exposing its innumerable burning eyes. Doing so surrounds the azgenzak with a fiery aura and activates its frightful presence ability. These abilities are suppressed when the azgenzak is not inverted. When it's inverted, creatures adjacent to the azgenzak take 2d6 points of fire damage and risk catching on fire. A successful DC 16 Reflex save halves this damage and keeps the creature from catching on fire. An inverted azgenzak loses its racial bonus to Stealth underwater and takes a further -10 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, when inverted, an azgenzak can't swallow its victim whole; however, if it begins its turn with a creature grappled, it can revert itself as a move action and then use its swallow whole ability. A creature swallowed by an azgenzak is subject to its fiery aura and frightful presence even when the azgenzak is not inverted.  Swarming Pyrocules (Su) As a full-round action, an azgenzak can disgorge a swarm of burning eyeballs. This swarm has the same statistics as a bat swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 30), except it lacks the wounding special ability, which is replaced by the azgenzak's burn ability and immunity to fire. An azgenzak using this ability takes 2d6 points of damage (though damage dealt to the swarming  pyrocules does not damage the azgenzak). The swarming pyrocules can't survive long separated from the azgenzak, and take 1 point of damage each round at the end of its turn. The swarming pyrocules can be reabsorbed by the azgenzak as a full-round action, healing the creature of 1d6 points of damage.

Dream Eating (Su) A baku can feed upon the dreams of any single sleeping creature within 100 feet. Alternatively, the baku can feed upon the dreams of a creature that it manages to contact with its dream spell-like ability. A creature can resist this effect with a DC 22 Will save. When a baku feeds in this way, it can elect to consume only nightmares or all dreams. If it only consumes nightmares, the target creature is immune to the effects of the nightmare spell, the dream haunting ability of the night hag, and other similar attacks for that period of sleep. If the baku instead feeds on all of the creature's dreams, that creature is fatigued upon waking and does not gain any benefits it would have received from sleep, such as natural healing or the ability to regain spells after resting. This is a mind-affecting sleep effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Mental Drain (Su) When a baku attacks with a claw, it can choose, as a swift action, to deal 1d4 points of Intelligence damage on that attack. A DC 22 Will save negates this ability damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Balban Demon	8.00	4800	Large	2	23, touch 11, flat-footed 21	103	14	5	8		19		40 ft.	2 slam +16 (2d6+8), bite +16 (1d8+8)		10 ft.	10 ft.	double damage against objects, pound, trample (2d8+12, DC 22)	Str 26, Dex 14, Con 23, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 12	9	18	30	Tome of Horrors Complete	Double Damage against Objects (Ex) A balban's powerful fists are particularly effective against objects. A balban deals double damage against an object or structure. Pound (Ex) A balban that makes a successful grapple check against a foe smaller than itself can smash the opponent into nearby solid objects (walls, floor, ground, etc.) as a standard action. This deals 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. Further, the victim must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. A balban can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.

The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be branded with a painless, glowing icon on its chest-usually the holy symbol of the deity or empyreal lord the balisse angel serves. This brand lasts for a number of days equal to the balisse angel's Hit Dice (10 days for most balisse angels). Anyone who attacks the branded target gains a +2 sacred bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls and a +2 sacred bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target's spell resistance. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Using this ability returns a blood hag to her normal form. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Fiery Form (Su): As a standard action, a blood hag who has removed her skin by using mask evil can assume the form of a flying ball of fire for up to 12 rounds. After leaving fiery form, a blood hag must wait 1d4 rounds before assuming it again. A blood hag in this form who enters the same space as another creature stops moving for that round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 negates) to that creature. A blood hag can suppress her heat and dim her light to that of an ember if she chooses, and can pass through openings and cracks as though in gaseous form. A blood hag in fiery form retains her AC and also has immunity to nonmagical attacks and effects. A successful targeted dispel magic spell or 20 points of cold damage returns her from her fiery form to her normal form. A blood hag can assume fiery form a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (typically 4). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Mask Evil (Su) During the day, a blood hag "wears her skin," giving her the appearance of a young woman. When so disguised, the blood hag can't use her bite, claws, or fiery form ability. At night, she bursts out of her skin and returns to her monstrous form. The hag regrows her skin each dawn. While a blood hag is wearing her skin, her alignment is masked as though by a constant undetectable alignment spell.

Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save each round or take 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stun (Su) Whenever a blood reaver hits with a dire flail attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.  This ability is a function of the blood reaver, not the dire flail.																												
Blood Weird	8.00	4800	Large	7	17, touch 12, flat-footed 14	75	7	10	8	transparency			40 ft.	bite +14 (2d6+6 plus siphon and grab)		10 ft.	5 ft.	drench, drown	Str 19, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 16	10	+15 (+19 grapple)	28 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Blood Pool (Ex) A blood weird's pool is a bubbling, flowing mass of dark, rich, red blood. Creatures pinned underneath the blood are subject to drowning (see below).  Drench (Ex) The weird's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic cast by a sorcerer whose level equals the weird's HD total.  Drown (Ex) If a blood weird grapples a foe, it can fully immerses its victim in its blood pool as a free action. A victim completely immersed must hold its breath or drown. See the "Drowning" section in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook.  Reform (Ex) When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a blood weird collapses back into its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any damage taken from fire-based spells and effects.  Siphon (Su) A blood weird that hits a foe siphons off a portion of its blood. This attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each time the blood weird hits. A creature struck can make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save to negate the ability damage that round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures without blood (GM's discretion) are immune to this effect.  Transparency (Ex) A blood weird is effectively invisible in its pool until it attacks.

The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid slain by a bodak's death gaze rises as a bodak 24 hours later. This is a death effect.  Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex) Bodaks loathe sunlight, for its merest touch burns their impure flesh.  Each round of exposure to direct sunlight deals 2d6 points of damage to a bodak.																												
Bog Creeper	8.00	4800	Medium	4	15, touch 10, flat-footed 15	95	12	3	5	camouflage			10 ft., swim 20 ft.	slam +11 (1d6+4), bite +11 (2d4+4), 4 tendrils +9  (1d4+2 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Camouflage (Ex) Since a bog creeper looks like a plant when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.  Marsh Move (Ex) A bog creeper can move across marshy terrain without incurring any movement penalties.																												
Bone Golem	8.00	4800	Large	6	21, touch 11, flat-footed 19	90	3	5	3				30 ft.	bite +14 (1d8+4), 2 slams +14 (2d6+4)		10 ft.	10 ft.	bone prison (ranged touch +12)	Str 18, Dex 15, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 1	11	+16 (+20 disarm or grapple)	28	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Bone Prison (Ex) As a standard action, a bone golem can throw some of its bones at a creature within 30 feet-it must make a ranged touch attack to hit. These bones magically duplicate and form a cage surrounding struck creatures. Each round, the cage makes a combat maneuver check to deal the golem's slam damage, using the golem's CMB. If the check fails, the target is still trapped but takes no damage. The target can escape the grapple normally, or can break out of the bones by dealing 15 points of damage to the prison, which has the same AC, DR, and saves as the bone golem itself. Damage to the prison has no effect on the golem. The golem can only have one bone prison active at a time. If it wishes to create a second one, it (or some other creature) must first destroy the existing one.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A bone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • Magical effects that heal living creatures slow a bone golem (as the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds (no save).  • A magical attack that deals negative energy damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A bone golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal negative energy damage.  • A raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection spell negates its DR and immunity to magic for 1 minute.

This bonus applies on combat maneuver checks and to CMD.  Camouflage (Ex) Because a canopy creeper blends in with the foliage that is its natural habitat, a DC 20 Perception check (modified for distance) is required to notice it before it attacks for the first time. Any creature with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use either of those skills (also modified for distance) instead of Perception to notice the plant.  Feed (Ex) When a canopy creeper grapples a creature with its tendrils, it begins to drain the creature's bodily fluids through the target's pores or other body orifices with its tendrils. This feeding deals 1d8 points of damage and 1 point of Strength damage to the target. If the vine tendril is severed or the target breaks the grapple, this feeding ceases until a new grapple is established.  Vine Tendrils (Ex) A canopy creeper can take control of any network of vines it has attached itself to and use up to four of those vines as weapons to strike out at targets up to 100 feet away. The vine tendrils have 10 hit points, DR 5/slashing, and a Break DC of 21. If one of these vines is destroyed, the canopy creeper can assume control of another vine as a move action to bring it to bear in combat.

These creatures must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be stunned for 1 round. Creatures that successfully save are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Wisdom-based.  Dazing Strike (Su) A creature struck by the cephalophore's slam attack must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be dazed for 1 round. Those who save are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Wisdom-based.  Shatter Weapon (Ex) When a character strikes a cephalophore with a weapon, the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage (apply its hardness normally). A weapon that takes damage in excess of its hardness gains the broken condition.  Statue Form (Ex) If a cephalophore stands perfectly still, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue. An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the cephalophore is alive. If a cephalophore initiates combat from this pose, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.

This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Cocoon (Ex) Once per round as a standard action, and no more than three times per day, a cerebral stalker can cocoon a grappled foe by shooting sticky webbing from its body. The webs cover as much of the victim as possible, excluding the top of the victim's head, its eyes, and its nose. The webs remain attached to the cerebral stalker's body and stretch from just under its arms to its knees. A cocooned victim is anchored to the cerebral stalker and cannot move. The cocooned creature can, as a standard action, break free with a successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check. The webbing has 8 hit points. Note the victim is still grappled even if it breaks the webbing and must succeed at a grapple check to get completely free of the cerebral stalker's grasp. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus. Once a victim is cocooned, the cerebral stalker can use its sink ability.  Consume Brain (Ex) Once it has its victim underground, the cerebral stalker begins gnawing on the victim's head, rapidly chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 2d8+4 points of damage each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker has reached its goal-the victim's brain, which it promptly devours. A victim slain in this manner is ejected from the ground and becomes a zombie (see below).  Create Zombie (Su): A creature whose brain is devoured by a cerebral stalker is ejected from the ground and animates as a zombie in 1d4 rounds. Zombies created in this manner are not under the control of the cerebral stalker.  Earth Glide (Ex) A cerebral stalker can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water.  Its gliding leaves no sign of its passage or hint of its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense. A move earth spell cast on an area.  Sink (Su) After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker begins sinking into the ground, taking the cocooned victim with it. It takes four full rounds for the stalker and foe to completely sink into the ground. In the first round, the creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist; in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both stalker and foe are completely underground.  opportunity.  Creatures attempting to grab the cocooned victim and prevent the sinking must first break or burn the webbing (see above), and then succeed at a grapple check against the cerebral stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold monster spell) for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker fails a Fortitude save. The stalker can make a new save each round to negate the paralysis. The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the victim is placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis).  The spot where the cerebral stalker and victim sunk radiates magic and can be detected normally. Spells such as locate object, discern location, scrying, and other divinatory magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A freedom spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects both it and the stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the surface.

They may climb icy surfaces as if under the effects of the spider climb spell.  Implements of Ice (Su) A cold rider wears full plate armor and wields a +2 icy burst glaive made of magical ice as hard as steel. Its armor does not restrict it in any way. When a cold rider dies, its armor and glaive melt into water in 1d6 rounds.  Susceptible to Shatter (Ex) A shatter spell deals 3d6 points of damage to a cold rider (no save) and reduces its armor bonus by 2 for 1 minute. Shatter spells automatically overcome a cold rider's spell resistance.																												
Common Time Elemental	8.00	4800	Medium	9	21, touch 18, flat-footed 15	102	7	13	10	foresight	19		fly 20 ft. (perfect)	2 slams +17 (1d6+3 plus cell death)		5 ft.	5 ft.	cell death, multi-manifestation	Str 16, Dex 20, Con 16, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 11	12	15	33	Tome of Horrors Complete	Alter Age (Su) Once per day, a noble time elemental can age a creature simply by touching it (this requires a melee touch attack). If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack. An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age. A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger). Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day. Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell. Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common). Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spell-like abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time. Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all. Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell. Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day. Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based. Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD).

Deadfall Scorpion	8.00	4800	Huge	2	21, touch 10, flat-footed 19	95	12	5	2				50 ft.	2 claws +13 (1d8+8 plus grab), sting +13 (1d8+8 plus poison)		15 ft.	15 ft.	constrict (1d8+8), sudden strike	Str 27, Dex 15, Con 20, Int -, Wis 14, Cha 2	7	4	12	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Sudden Strike (Ex) A deadfall scorpion is adept at moving quickly when its foes are surprised.

Deathtrap Ooze	8.00	4800	Large	-4	10, touch 5, flat-footed 10	126	10	0	8				20 ft., climb 20 ft.	slam +13 (2d6+7 plus 2d6 acid and grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	constrict (2d6+7 plus 2d6 acid)	Str 20, Dex 3, Con 22, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	9	17	29 (41 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Acid (Ex) A deathtrap ooze secretes acid that dissolves only flesh. Creatures made of materials other than flesh are immune to this acid.  Trap Form (Su) Taking 1 minute to do so, a deathtrap ooze can assume the form of any Medium or Large mechanical trap that has no more than one moving part (excluding pits). The ooze can maintain this form indefinitely. The trap it can assume the form of must be of a CR equal to or less than that of the deathtrap ooze itself-appropriate traps from pages 420-421 of the Core Rulebook include the swinging axe trap (CR 1), the wall scythe trap (CR 4), and the falling block trap (CR 5). In trap form, the ooze uses its attack bonus, but otherwise functions as the emulated trap and uses that trap's statistics and damage. If a creature searching for traps exceeds the DC to find the ooze's trap form, a successful follow-up DC 19 Knowledge (dungeoneering) check allows the creature that discovered the trap to discern its true nature. If the ooze takes any damage, it reverts to its normal form as a free action. Otherwise, reverting to its normal form takes a swift action.

Constructs, elementals, and other creatures that do not possess flesh are immune to this effect. A successful DC 19 Fortitude save reduces the Dexterity drain to 1 point. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Planar Fast Healing (Su) A denizen of Leng maintains a connection to Leng at all times, and when away from Leng, it has fast healing 5. It loses this ability on Leng or in areas where planar connections do not function. If killed, a denizen's body dissolves into nothingness in 1d4 rounds, leaving behind its equipment. A slain denizen reforms in Leng, similar to a slain summoned creature; it can only be permanently killed if its fast healing is negated.  Unusual Anatomy (Ex) A denizen's internal anatomy varies from individual to individual, and has a 50% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack against it as a normal hit.

Sandstorm Breath (Su) As a standard action, a desert drake can spit a ball of electrically charged sand that bursts into a cloud. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of slashing damage plus 4d8 points of electricity damage in a 15-foot-radius spread (Reflex DC 19 half ). The cloud  remains for 1d4 rounds, dealing no damage but otherwise acting as obscuring mist. Once a desert drake uses its breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Savage Bite (Ex) A desert drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a desert drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an additional move action that round.

It can adjust the harmonics of its sonic cry to generate one of two different effects on targets within the area of effect, but can only create one of these effects with each use of this ability. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Destruction: All creatures within the area of effect of the destructive harmonics take 8d6 points of sonic damage-a DC 19 Reflex save halves this damage. If the destrachan wishes, this damage can instead deal nonlethal damage rather than sonic damage. Alternatively, the destrachan can target a single crystal, metal, stone, or wooden object within 80 feet with this attack-that object takes 8d6 points of damage. This damage is not halved when applied to the object's hit points, but is reduced by the object's hardness.  A magical or attended object can attempt a DC 19 Reflex save to halve the damage.  Pain: Rather than deal damage, the destrachan can cause intense pain and overwhelming sound to affect all creatures within the area. Targets in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d6 rounds.  Protection from Sonics (Ex) A destrachan gains a +4 racial bonus on all saves against sonic attacks. It is immune to the effects of its own destructive harmonics. A destrachan whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded, treating all targets as if they had total concealment.																												
Dimensional Shambler	8.00	4800	Medium	7	21, touch 13, flat-footed 18	94	11	8	7	resist conjuration			30 ft.	2 claws +14 (2d6+5 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	dimension mastery, shift planes	Str 21, Dex 16, Con 20, Int 7, Wis 14, Cha 13	9	24	33 (can't be tripped)	AP 46	Dimension Mastery (Ex) A dimensional shambler can take actions normally after using dimension door effects. A dimensional shambler under the effects of a dimensional anchor or dimensional lock spell can ignore the effects of the spell for 1 round by making a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check as a move action.  Resist Conjuration (Ex) Dimensional shamblers detest being conjured by other creatures. They are immune to all spell effects of the summoning school, and are treated as if they had double their actual Hit Dice (18 HD for most dimensional shamblers) for the purposes of determining if they can be conjured by spells like planar ally or planar binding.  Shift Planes (Su) A dimensional shambler can shift between planes once per hour, using an effect that is similar to that created by the plane shift spell, save that a dimensional shambler is a master of such travel and can manifest at an exact location on its destination plane if it makes a DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. If it exceeds this DC by 10 or more, it can place itself in such a position upon arrival that if combat immediately results from its appearance, it gains a +10 bonus on its resulting initiative check.  Using shift planes is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, during which the dimensional shambler shimmers and grows increasingly transparent.  A dimensional shambler can use this ability while grappling a creature-doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity from the creature it is grappling. If the creature is of the dimensional shambler's size or smaller (Medium for most dimensional shamblers), that creature shifts planes with the dimensional shambler unless it makes a DC 15 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Str 18, Dex 17, Con 21, Int 4, Wis 14, Cha 15	6	13	28 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Enervating Aura (Su) Negative energy weeps from a dreadweed's form. Living creatures in the area take 2d6 points of negative energy damage each round. A successful DC 19 Fortitude save negates the damage that round. A new save must be made each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Enervating Ray (Su) Once per round and no more than three times per day, as a standard action, a dreadweed can fire a ray of negative energy at a single target to a range of 30 feet. This ray functions as an enervation spell (CL 8th). Each time a dreadweed uses this ray, it suppresses its enervating aura for 1d4 rounds.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save DC 19 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vines (Ex) A dreadweed can extend up to four vines from its body at a time, launching them to a maximum range of 20 feet. A dreadweed's attacks with its vines resolve as ranged touch attacks. These vines are quite strong, but can be severed by any amount of slashing damage (a vine is AC 20).If a dreadweed uses its pull ability to pull a target within reach of its bite attack, it can immediately make a free bite attack with a +4 bonus on its attack roll against that target.

The target takes 6d6 points of acid damage. A successful DC 18 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

If the target can't breathe water, it's unable hold its breath and immediately begins to drown. At the start of its next turn, the target must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save to cough up this water or it falls unconscious and is brought to 0 hit points. On the next round, the target must save successfully again or drop to -1 hit point and start dying; on the third round it must save successfully again or die. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Heavy Aura (Su) Whenever a creature enters the drowning devil's heavy aura, it must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or reduce its speed as if carrying a load one step higher or wearing armor one category heavier (whichever is worse), and its armor check penalty increases by 2. A creature already carrying a heavy load or wearing heavy armor that fails its save can't move as long as it remains in the affected area. A creature that saves against a drowning devil's heavy aura is immune to that devil's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Slam-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.

The dust ghoul can control and direct these creatures as long as it is "alive" and within 100 feet. The dust creatures have a speed of 10 feet and each has only one attack; a grapple. Each has a CMB equal to 1/2 dust ghoul's HD + its Strength modifier (+12 CMB for the standard dust ghoul). A dust creature holds but does not harm creatures it grapples. The dust humanoids are immune to all attacks and spells, except water-based spells and effects. A gallon of water instantly destroys a dust humanoid. If the dust ghoul moves more than 100 feet away from a dust creature, that dust creature collapses into a pile of harmless dust. If the dust ghoul is destroyed, all dust creatures it animated collapse. Augmented Critical (Ex) A dust ghoul's claws are razor-sharp. It threatens a critical hit on an attack roll of 19-20. On a successful critical hit with a claw, it deals triple damage. Earth Mastery (Ex) A dust ghoul gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if its foe is touching the ground. If an opponent is waterborne, the dust ghoul takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Limited Flight (Ex) A dust ghoul can fly for a number of minutes equal to its Charisma modifier (minimum 1). After that, it must rest for 10 minutes before it can fly again. Paralyzing Shriek (Su) Once per minute, a dust ghoul can unleash a hellish shriek that paralyzes any creature within 60 feet that hears it. Affected creatures that succeed on a DC 19 Will save negate the paralysis. This is a mind-affecting, fear and sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the efreeti chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Heat (Ex) An efreeti's body deals 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples.																												
Ember Weaver	8.00	4800	Medium	6	22, touch 16, flat-footed 16	104	11	8	12		19		30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Any living or dead creature within 300 feet with line of sight to the dancing embers must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or else any protections or immunities it has against charm, fear, and mind-affecting effects are suppressed for as long as the ember weaver uses a free action to maintain the effect each round and for 1 round thereafter. Once a creature succeeds at this saving throw, it can't be affected by an eerie radiance for 24 hours. The light has no effect on psychopomps, creatures that can't see, and creatures the ember weaver chooses to exclude. This is a sight-based abjuration effect.  Rush of Souls (Su) As a standard action every 1d4+1 rounds, an ember weaver can call forth a rush of souls to trample its foes. This ability deals 6d6 points of force damage to all creatures in a 60-foot cone. A successful DC 19 Reflex saving throw halves the damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Mindfeed (Su) If an encephalon gorger begins its turn grappling an opponent, it can attempt to suck its brain fluid with a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains cerebral fluid, dealing 1d4 points of Intelligence drain each round the pin is maintained. On each successful mindfeed attack, the encephalon gorger gains 5 temporary hit points.  This ability does not work against nonliving creatures or creatures without a central brain mass. The encephalon gorger must be able to reach the head or neck of the target creature to use this ability.  Mindsense (Su) As a move action, an encephalon gorger can gauge the relative intelligence level of any creature within 60 feet as follows: unintelligent, animal (Int 1-2), low (3-8), average (8-12), high (13-16), genius (17-20), or supra-genius (21+).  Mind Screen (Ex) The mind of an encephalon gorger is an alien and dangerous place. Should a creature attempt to scan the mind or read the thoughts of an encephalon gorger (with detect thoughts, telepathy, or the like), it must make a successful (DC 20) Will save or be driven permanently insane (as by an insanity spell, caster level 15th); if the save succeeds, the creature is instead confused (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Intelligence-based.

Any creature that takes damage from a fallen's attacks must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear. If a creature that has immunity to fear fails this saving throw, its immunity is temporarily suppressed. This effect lasts as long as a creature still suffers damage taken from a fallen's attacks. This effect is removed if the creature is healed of all damage inflicted by a fallen. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Curse of the Unburied (Su) Once per day, a fallen can demand that a good-aligned cleric, paladin, or cleric whose deity is opposed to the creation of undead locate its remains and perform a funeral for it on holy ground (through specific use of consecrate or hallow). The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or take a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, the target can attempt a new saving throw; success keeps the target from accruing an additional -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. No ability score can be reduced below 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed immediately upon completing the funeral rites for the fallen. The target does not need to complete the rites personally, but it is responsible for seeing that they're carried out. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Phantom Armaments (Su) A fallen possesses a semblance of the gear it carried in life. A fallen's weapons and armor are formed of force, allowing the fallen to make physical attacks and wear protective armor. Though solid and formed of force, this gear cannot be disarmed or removed from the fallen. Arrows fired from the fallen's longbow vanish after dealing damage to their target.  Rejuvenation (Su) A fallen is tied to the place where it fell in battle or the location where its remains were dragged after it fell in combat. Unless slain permanently, it reforms there 2d4 days later. A fallen is permanently destroyed and its soul is released when funeral rites lasting at least 1 minute are performed on its remains while on consecrated or hallowed ground.  Touch of the Grave (Su) All of a fallen's melee and ranged attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage.

Deadly Bleeding (Su) A feeder in the depth's bite causes bleeding wounds that resist healing. The first bite that damages a creature deals 1d4 points of bleed damage, and each subsequent bite increases the amount of bleed by 1d4. Stopping the bleeding requires a successful DC 20 Heal check or the application of any magical healing. However, anyone attempting to cast a healing spell on a creature suffering from deadly bleeding must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check or the spell doesn't affect the bleeding creature. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Keen Scent (Ex) A feeder in the depths can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater, and can detect blood in the water at a distance of up to 1 mile.

Giving the corpse a proper burial (or cremation) prevents it from becoming a festering spirit.  Ghost Touch (Su) A festering spirit can manipulate corporeal objects that weigh up to 25 pounds as if those objects had the ghost touch special ability.  Slime (Su) A festering spirit's slime resembles the putrefying sludge of decaying corpses. Any creature that is hit by the spirit's incorporeal touch attack, passes through its square, or hits it with a natural weapon or unarmed strike must attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is nauseated for 1d4 rounds, and on a success the creature is staggered for 1 round. A festering spirit's slime persists on objects and creatures for 1d10 minutes but has no harmful effect after its initial contact. Creatures immune to poison or disease are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Trample (Ex) The DC of a festering spirit's trample is Charisma-based.

Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be blinded for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Chant (Su) By chanting for one full round, a firebird can create any one of the following effects: cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness, remove disease, remove fear, or slow poison. Each is usable once per round at will, but a single creature can only gain the benefit of each one once per day. Each functions as the spell of the same name with a caster level equal to the firebird's Hit Dice.

This acid quickly falls and covers a 10-foot-radius burst around the fountain fungus. Creatures in the area take 7d6 points of acid damage. A DC 21 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save is Constitution-based.  Camouflage (Ex) Since a fountain fungus looks like a normal moss-covered fountain when at rest, a DC 20 Perception check is required to notice it before it attacks for the first time. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use either of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.																												
Frightful Haunter	8.00	4800	Medium	7	16, touch 15, flat-footed 12	60	5	5	9				fly 40 ft. (perfect)	terrifying touch +9 (3d8 plus Will DC 17 or shaken)		5 ft.	5 ft.	create haunt, terrifying touch (DC 17)	Str -, Dex 17, Con -, Int 15, Wis 17, Cha 16	6	6	21	Monster Codex	Aura of Cowardice (Su) A frightful haunter radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 30 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of a frightful haunter with this ability.  Create Haunt (Su) A frightful haunter has so much rage and desire to create fear that it can actually create a haunt (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 242) once per hour. Each haunt has a CR no greater than the frightful haunter's CR - 2, and often takes a form either tied to the location the frightful haunter selects for it or inspired by the victims the frightful haunter hopes to frighten.  Unlike a typical haunt, those created by a frightful haunter are destroyed when neutralized, and fade away after a number of days equal to the creator's Hit Dice. A frightful haunter cannot have more than 1 haunt active per HD; if any haunt is created that exceeds that limit, the oldest active haunt is neutralized.  Fear Eater (Su) A frightful haunter has an amount of fast healing equal to the number of creatures within 30 feet currently suffering from a fear effect.  Made of Fear (Su) A frightful haunter is immune to the effects of a haunt, even those it does not create.  Terrifying Touch (Su) A creature struck by a frightful haunter's touch attack takes 3d8 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or be shaken for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds at the save can't be made shaken by the terrifying touch for 24 hours, but can still take damage from it. Successfully using terrifying touch multiple times extends only the duration of its effect; it does not create a stronger fear condition. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.

Affected creatures must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Those making their save are blinded for 1d4+4 rounds. Those failing their save take 10d6 points of damage. A creature that makes its save is immune to the annihilating wail of that galley beggar for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Draining Touch (Su) The incorporeal touch of a galley beggar drains 1d4 points of Charisma. On a successful attack, the galley beggar also heals 5 points of damage to itself.  Incorporeal Touch (Su) By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the galley beggar inflicts 5d6+3 damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.  Unholy Touch (Su) A galley beggar adds its Charisma modifier to damage for its incorporeal touch attack.																												
Gammenore	8.00	4800	Large	5	22, touch 10, flat-footed 21	102	11	11	7	shell of ice		vulnerable to fire	40 ft., climb 20 ft.	claw +17 (1d6+6/19-20), pincer +17 (2d6+9 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	constrict (2d6+9), ice spikes, oversized pincer	Str 23, Dex 12, Con 16, Int 3, Wis 16, Cha 7	12	+19 (+23 grapple)	30 (42 vs. trip)	AP 89	Ice Spikes (Su) As a standard action, a gammenore can force freezing water through pores in its carapace to produce long, sharp spikes of ice. These spikes impale nearby creatures, dealing 6d6 points of piercing damage to each creature adjacent to the gammenore (Reflex DC 19 half). Additionally, the spikes shatter easily, embedding shards of ice in the flesh of creatures that fail their saving throws against the attack-these shards deal 1d6 points of bleed damage each round until the wounds are healed. A gammenore can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Oversized Pincer (Ex) A gammenore's pincer attack is a primary attack that deals the indicated amount of damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier.  Shell of Ice (Su) Much of a gammenore's carapace is encased in a thick layer of jagged icicles. This shell of ice functions much like spiked armor, dealing 1d8 points of piercing damage to the target of any successful grapple combat maneuver check made by the gammenore.  Additionally, this frozen shell helps to regulate the gammenore's cold body temperature, granting it resistance 10 to fire. The shell can absorb up to 60 points of fire damage before melting. Once the shell melts, the gammenore takes a -4 penalty to its natural armor bonus, it loses its fire resistance, and it deals no additional damage when grappling. A gammenore can reconstitute a melted shell by spending time in areas of intense cold. This process takes 2 hours in a cold environment, 3d10 minutes in areas of severe cold, and 1d10 minutes in areas of extreme cold.

A gargoyle guardian that uses freeze can take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.  Snatch (Ex) A gargoyle guardian can start a grapple when it hits with both claw attacks, as though it had the grab ability. If it grapples a creature of size Medium or smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic claw damage with a successful grapple check. A gargoyle guardian can fly while holding a creature that weighs 350 pounds or less. It cannot throw creatures it is carrying, but can drop them as a free action.

With a successful ranged touch attack, the target takes 10d6 points of acid damage (no save).  Malleable (Ex) A giant slug's body is very malleable, allowing it to fit into narrow areas with ease.  A giant slug takes no penalty to its speed or checks when squeezing in an area that is one size category smaller than its actual size (10 feet wide for most giant slugs). A giant slug can squeeze normally through an area two size categories smaller than its actual size (5 feet wide for most giant slugs).  Susceptible to Salt (Ex) A handful of salt burns a giant slug as if it were a flask of acid, causing 1d6 points of damage per use.

It can squeeze through tight spaces as if it were a Medium-sized creature.  Rubbery Hide (Ex) A giant slug's rubbery hide grants it immunity to critical hits and precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks.  Salt Vulnerability (Ex) A giant slug is highly susceptible to salt, and takes 1d6 points of damage per pound of salt it contacts.  Spit Acid (Ex) Every 1d4 rounds, a giant slug can spit a line of acid at an opponent within 60 feet (no range increment).  A successful ranged touch attack is required to hit. If struck, a target takes 4d8 points of acid damage.

Any creature within 30 feet must make a DC 19 or be blinded for 1d6 minutes. A creature can defend against this effect in the same way it would a gaze attack. This is a sight-based effect. The DC is Constitution-based. Wing Razors (Ex) A giant stymphalides's metallic feathers are razor-sharp. In addition to being able to slash creatures with its wings as a melee attack, it may beat its wings, flinging two large, feathered shards at a single target. These wing razors deal 2d6 points of damage and cause bleed. A giant stymphalides can use this attack a number of time per day equal to its Constitution modifier.

Str 35, Dex 13, Con 24, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2	7	23	34 (46 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Barbed Hairs (Ex) A tarantula can throw barbed hairs from its back at a creature as a ranged touch attack (range increment 20 feet).  A creature struck by these hairs must make a DC 22 Fort save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. A creature that attacks a giant tarantula with a non-reach melee weapon must make a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid being struck by these hairs. The save DC is Con-based.  Poison (Ex) Bite- injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Save DC is Con-based with a +2 racial bonus.

Scorpion Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save that it works only on scorpions. A girtablilu gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice (normally +10). Scorpions are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing girtablilus to train scorpions and use them as guardians (though it does not grant them skills or feats).

Once a creature makes its save against this ability, it is immune to that golem's brightness for 24 hours. The DC is Constitution-based.  Immune to Magic (Ex) A glass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a glass golem, as noted below.  • A shatter spell damages a glass golem as if it were a crystalline creature.  • A keen edge spell affects all of a glass golem's slam attacks as if they were slashing weapons.  • A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a glass golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no saving throw).  • A magical attack that deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A glass golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.  Reflect Spells (Ex) As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, a glass golem can align its internal structure to enhance its resistance to magic for 1 round. During this time, the golem reflects spells (even spells that function differently against the golem as described in its immune to magic ability) as if under the effect of a spell turning spell.

Those caught in the area of the gas can attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save to resist the effects, but those who fail the save are immediately petrified. This petrification is temporary-each round, a petrified creature can attempt a new DC 21 Fortitude save to recover from the petrification as long as it is not caught within the area of effect of the gorgon's breath weapon a second time while petrified. A creature exposed to the gorgon's breath a second time while already petrified becomes permanently petrified, and can no longer attempt to make additional Fortitude saves to recover naturally.

This effect is especially devastating to plants, animals, and aquatic creatures, which take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Earth Mastery (Ex) A salt elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)  Salt Poisoning (Ex) Anyone hit by a salt elemental's claw attack is sickened for 3 rounds + 1 round per Hit Dice of the salt elemental. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A salt elemental submerged in water that covers at least half its body takes 1d6 points of damage each round until it escapes. Damage from water-based attacks (such as the slam attack of a water elemental) deal +50% damage to a salt elemental.

This is a negative energy effect. A creature dies if this Strength damage equals or exceeds its actual Strength score.																												
Guecubu	8.00	4800	Medium	8	21, touch 15, flat-footed 16	104	8	7	11	channel resistance +2			30 ft., burrow 15 ft.	bite +14 (1d8+6 plus misfortune), 2 slams +14 (1d6+6 plus misfortune)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 22, Dex 18, Con -, Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 21	8	14	29	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Broken Ground (Su) The ground in a 30-foot radius around a guecubu ripples and shudders unnaturally. This transforms the area surrounding a guecubu into difficult terrain. A guecubu can move through this area with no penalty. Consecrated ground cannot be affected by this ability, nor can any area warded by a magic circle against chaos or a magic circle against evil.  Misfortune (Su) A creature struck by a guecubu must make a DC 20 Will save or become permanently cursed with misfortune. The victim of this curse takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and any critical threat against the victim automatically confirms. If a guecubu hits a creature already suffering from this curse, the victim must make a DC 20 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Inhabiting a body requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large. The swarm can abandon the body at any time as a full-round action. Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm's DR, resistances, and immunities may negate some or all of this damage.  When a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it effectively transforms the corpse into a zombie of the appropriate size under the swarm's control. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and actions as if using dominate monster. Hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour.  A hellwasp-inhabited creature is easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of the insects inside. A swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a -4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host.  A remove disease or heal spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.  Poison (Ex) Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Creatures caught in the webs when they catch fire take 2d6 points of fire damage each round until they escape. After escaping, creatures continue taking this damage each round unless they succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save. A new save can be made each round to extinguish the fire.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save DC 23 Fort; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage plus 1d6 fire damage and staggered; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  Venom Resistance (Ex) Hellwidows gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against spider venom.

Anyone within 30 feet who sets eyes upon the hooded horror must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be instantly weakened, taking 1d6 points of Strength damage. Creatures that are affected by this ability or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same hooded horror's horrific appearance for one day. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals. Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals. Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

Creatures viewing this burst must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. See the table below for the save DC for each positive energy elemental's blinding flash. The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Throes (Su) A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura). Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's positive energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's positive energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. All creatures in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC as the elemental's positive energy save DC) or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Positive Energy (Ex) A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with positive energy. This deals extra damage to an undead or negative energy based target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) by the same amount. Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of positive energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each positive energy elemental's save DC. Positive energy (such as a cure spell or positive energy channeling) can heal positive energy elementals. Positive Energy Aura (Su) A positive energy elemental radiates an aura of pure positive energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher.

While gliding, the hydrodaemon gains the pounce ability.  Sleep Spittle (Su) A hydrodaemon can spit at a single target within 20 feet, making a ranged touch attack as a standard action. A target hit by this spittle must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or fall asleep for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Iku-Turso	8.00	4800	Medium	7	21, touch 14, flat-footed 17	102	8	9	11			light blindness	20 ft., swim 60 ft.	bite +16 (1d8+7 plus disease), 2 claws +16 (1d6+7)		5 ft.	5 ft.	light lure	Str 24, Dex 16, Con 19, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 17	9	16	30 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Disease (Su) An iku-turso's bite inflicts a strange, supernatural disease called tursas. This disease causes the victim's skin to grow painfully scaly, causes strange hallucinations, and eventually transforms the victim into an iku-turso.  Tursas: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 20; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Wis damage and 1d6 Cha drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. As long as a victim suffers any ability damage from tursas, it gains the ability to breathe water. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma by this disease transforms into a fully grown and healthy iku-turso-it immediately forgets its previous life and abilities and seeks out the nearest iku-turso community to join it. A wish or miracle can reverse this transformation. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Light Lure (Su) As a standard action, an iku-turso can call forth a few small points of light, functioning like a dancing lights spell (CL equals the iku-turso's HD) except as described here. Creatures within 100 feet of one of these lights must make a DC 19 Will save upon sighting them or be compelled to approach them by the safest and most direct path. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same iku-turso's light lure for 24 hours. If a subject of this effect has to move through hazardous terrain to reach the lights, that subject receives another saving throw to end the effect before entering the hazardous terrain. This effect ends once the character reaches the light or takes any form of damage. This is a visual mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Str 20, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 15, Wis 16, Cha 15	8	14	27 (can't be tripped)	Plunder & Peril	Black Coral Secretion (Ex) An incutilis lord's tentacles generate an oily black residue that quickly hardens into a dense, coral-like substance. A single application covers a 5 foot square and completely hardens in 1 minute, even when exposed to water. This substance is malleable until hardened, allowing an incutilis lord or the lord's minions to shape it into armor, walls, and more. Once calcified, it has a hardness of 4 and 8 hit points per inch of thickness. An incutilis lord can produce one application of black coral per Hit Die each day.  Calcified Minion (Su) A calcifying stinger imparts a strong psychic connection between a calcified target and the incutilis lord who implanted the stinger. Once the target succumbs to the incutilis lord's will (see the calcifying sting ability, below), the target's whole body is infused with new secretions that allow the incutilis lord to dictate the target's actions and restore any Dexterity lost to the calcifying sting, as the secretions assist the minion's movement rather than hindering it. The incutilis lord can control a number of minions equal to its Charisma modifier as a free action. If the incutilis lord attempts to control a new minion in excess of this limit, it must first release one of its current calcified minions; see the calcifying sting ability, below. The minions have no will of their own but retain a small portion of their identity, giving the incutilis lord access to their feats, physical skills, extraordinary abilities, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A calcified creature moves under the direct control of its incutilis lord until the stinger is removed from its body.  While under the incutilis lord's control, a calcified minion takes its own normal actions each round, as directed by its controller. A minion can survive this process for a number of days equal to its Constitution score. After this time, the calcified minion dies, though its body retains a semblance of life. The dead minion is treated as a living creature and can be controlled in the same fashion as before until the calcifying stinger is removed or the incutilis lord that controls the creature dies.  Calcifying Sting (Su) The tentacles of an incutilis lord inject a painful stinger that constantly generates a black coral secretion. A creature stung by an incutilis lord must attempt a DC 19 Fortitude saving throw at the beginning of every turn until the stinger is removed. Each time it fails this save, the creature takes an additional 1d6 points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity drain. If this causes the creature to reach 0 or fewer hit points or a Dexterity score of 0, it loses all will of its own and immediately comes under the control of the incutilis lord (see the calcified minion ability, above).  As a swift action, the incutilis lord can psychically command one of its stingers to remove itself from a stung creature, releasing its control over that creature. Another creature can forcefully remove a stinger from a willing or unconscious target by a succeeding at a DC 19 Heal check. Regardless of whether this Heal check succeeds or fails, attempting to remove the stinger deals 1d8 points of damage to the target. If the stinger is removed or the incutilis lord dies, the fluid seeps out of the controlled creature's wounds and the creature is released from the incutilis lord's control-though the creature may be dead by that time. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This is a coup de grace attempt that inflicts 8d4+3d6+8 points of damage.  If the victim is slain (or already dead), the intellect devourer usurps control of the body and may use it as its own, as if it controlled the target via a dominate monster spell. The intellect devourer has full access to all of the host's defensive and offensive abilities save for spellcasting and spell-like abilities (although the intellect devourer can still use its own spell-like abilities). A host body may not have been dead for longer than 1 day for this ability to function, and even successfully inhabited bodies decay to uselessness in 7 days (unless this time is extended via gentle repose). As long as the intellect devourer occupies the body, it knows (and can speak) the languages known by the victim and basic information about the victim's identity and personality, yet has none of the victim's specific memories or knowledge. Damage done to a host body does not harm the intellect devourer, and if the host body is slain, the intellect devourer emerges and is dazed for 1 round. Raise dead cannot restore a victim of body theft, but resurrection or more powerful magic can.  Vulnerable to Protection from Evil (Ex) An intellect devourer is treated as a summoned creature for the purpose of determining how it is affected by a protection from evil spell.

This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals.  Swamp Stride (Ex) A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.  Water Breathing (Ex) A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

This functions as gust of wind, but any creature in its path must make a Fortitude save (DC 19) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand.  Move Sand (Su) A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell.  Sleep Breath (Su) Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a cone of sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+4 rounds.

The creature can make a DC 18 save DC to resist the effects. The save DC is Constitutionbased.  Underwater Concealment (Ex) The main body of a kelp devil remains submerged even when attacking.

Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a lamia matriarch.  Wisdom Drain (Su) A lamia matriarch drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time she hits with her melee touch attack. The first time each round that she strikes a foe with a melee weapon, she also drains 1 point of Wisdom. A DC 21 Will save negates the Wisdom drain. Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a lamia matriarch does not heal damage when she uses her Wisdom drain. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Heated Flesh (Ex) Any metal weapon striking a lava lizard must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 3d6 points of fire damage. Wooden weapons take double damage. Damage caused to weapons in this manner is not halved, but hardness does help prevent some of the damage dealt. Unarmed and natural attacks made against the lava lizard deal 2d6 points of fire damage to the attacker. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Lava Affinity (Ex) A lava lizard can breathe and swim while submerged in lava and magma.																												
Lava Weird	8.00	4800	Large	7	19, touch 12, flat-footed 16	95	10	6	8			vulnerability to cold	40 ft.	bite +15 (1d8+7 plus grab)		10 ft.	5 ft.	control elemental, drown, fire, lava pool	Str 21, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 16	10	+16 (+20 grapple)	29 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Control Elemental (Ex) Lava weirds can attempt to command any outsider with the "Earth," "Elemental," or "Fire" subtype that is within 50 feet. The Will save to avoid control has a DC of 21. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus. This effect is similar to the dominate monster spell. The elemental receives a Will save to avoid being commanded. If the save succeeds, that elemental is immune to the control elemental ability of that lava weird for one day. If the save fails, the elemental falls under the control of the lava weird and obeys it to the best of its ability until either it or the weird dies. There is no limit to the number of HD of elementals a lava weird can control using this ability. The range is unlimited though both the lava weird and the elemental must be on the same plane of existence; otherwise, the weird loses control of the elemental. Lava weirds cannot control other lava weirds using this ability. Fire (Ex) Lava weirds are living creatures of elemental magma; any successful melee hit deals fire damage and the victim must make a successful Reflex save (DC 16) or catch on fire (see Catching on Fire in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook). The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures attacking a lava weird unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage and must make a successful Reflex save to avoid catching on fire just as if the lava weird had hit with its attack. Drown (Ex) If a lava weird pins a grabbed foe, it fully immerses its victim in its lava pool. A victim completely immersed takes fire damage (see Lava Pool below) and must hold its breath or drown. The victim can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. After that, the victim must make a successful Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each round to continue holding its breath. If the victim fails a check, it drowns. In the first round, the victim falls unconscious (0 hp). In the next round, the creature is dying (-1 hp), and in the third round the victim drowns. Lava Pool A lava weird's pool is a bubbling, churning, morass of molten rock mixed with elemental fire. Flammable materials that contact the lava pool automatically catch fire on the round contact is made. Creatures touching the pool take 2d8 points of fire damage per round of contact. Damage from the lava pool continues for 1d3 rounds after contact ceases, but this extra damage is only half of that dealt during contact (1d8 points of damage). Creatures immune to fire are unaffected by the lava weird's pool and take no damage, though they can still drown if completely immersed. Reform (Ex) When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a lava weird collapses back into its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any damage taken from coldbased effects or attacks. Transparency (Ex) A lava weird is effectively invisible in its lava pool until it attacks.

Electric Healing (Ex) Electricity damage heals a lightning treant 1 point of damage for every 3 points it would otherwise deal. If the amount would cause the lightning treant to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points-these temporary hit points last for 2 hours.

The Will save to avoid control has a DC of 20. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  This effect is similar to the dominate monster spell. The elemental receives a Will save to avoid being commanded.  If the save succeeds, that elemental is immune to the control elemental ability of that lightning weird for one day.  If the save fails, the elemental falls under the control of the lightning weird and obeys it to the best of its ability until either it or the lightning weird dies. There is no limit to the number of HD of elementals a lightning weird can control using this ability. The range is unlimited though both the lightning weird and the elemental must be on the same plane of existence; otherwise, the lightning weird loses control of the elemental. Lightning weirds cannot control other lightning weirds using this ability.  Electricity (Ex) Lightning weirds are living creatures of elemental lightning; any successful melee hit deals electricity damage. Creatures attacking a lightning weird unarmed or with natural weapons are subject to electricity damage.  Lightning Pool A lightning weird's pool is a crackling, dancing, arcing, ball of electricity. Creatures touching the pool take 2d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact. Creatures wearing metal armor must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 16) each round they are in contact with the pool or be stunned for that round.  Creatures immune to electricity are unaffected by the lightning weird's pool and take no damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Reform (Ex) When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a lightning weird collapses back into its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any damage taken from earthor fire-based attacks and effects (including attacks by earth or fire elemental creatures).  Transparency (Ex) A lightning weird is effectively invisible in its lightning pool until it attacks.

The save DC is Charisma-based.  Preserved Mind (Ex) A living effigy is inhabited by an entrenched spirit that holds on to some aspects of its former intellect. A living effigy can choose two Knowledge skills, typically Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (religion). These Knowledge skills are class skills for the living effigy, and it gains a +4 racial bonus on checks with these skills.  Shape Self (Sp) Three times a day, a living effigy can shift its facial expression as if using stone shape, even though the  construct exceeds the volume the spell can usually affect and is a creature rather than an object.  Silent Watcher (Su) As a standard action, a living effigy can use greater teleport (self only) as long as there are no creatures with an Intelligence score higher than 2 within 150 feet that can see the effigy. When using this ability, the living effigy can travel up to 10 miles from its settlement.  Statue (Ex) A living effigy can remain perfectly still and emulate a statue. An observer must succeed at a DC 25 Perception check to notice that the living effigy is alive. If a living effigy initiates combat from this pose, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.  Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) Unlike most constructs, a living effigy isn't immune to mind-affecting effects.

When armed and thrown, it detonates at the beginning of the machine slayer's next turn. The explosion deals 5d6 points of electricity damage to all targets within a 20-foot-radius spread (Reflex DC 15 half). An arc grenade weighs 1 pound and is worth 750 gp.

For every four creatures affected by this ability, the maenad gains 1d10 temporary hit points and her Charisma score increases by 1; these benefits end if the affected creatures break free of the dance.  Mad Feast (Su) As a full-round action, a maenad can conjure a supernatural feast. Creatures eating from this feast gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution, 1d8 temporary hit points, and a +4 morale bonus on fear saves for 12 hours. Creatures affected also take a -4 penalty on Will saving throws (this penalty does not apply on saves against fear), and find it more compelling to engage in debauchery, excess, and violence.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Energy Bolts (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, a marai's six snake arms can each spit a bolt of energy to a maximum range of 60 feet. Each bolt deals 1d8 points of damage and has an additional effect if the target fails to resist it with a DC 19 Fortitude save, as summarized below. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Amethyst Viper: Cold damage plus sickened for 1d4 rounds.  Crimson Viper: Fire damage plus burn (1d4, DC 19).  Emerald Viper: Acid damage plus nauseated for 1 round.

Marrowstone Golem	8.00	4800	Large	0	21, touch 9, flat-footed 21	85	3	3	3				30 ft.	2 slams +14 (2d6+5 plus 2d6 negative energy)		10 ft.	10 ft.	create spawn	Str 20, Dex 11, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	10	16	26	Inner Sea Bestiary	Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by a marrowstone golem rises from death as a free-willed ghoul in 24 hours. A creature with four or more class levels rises as a ghast instead. In either case, the ghoul or ghast has a 25% chance of retaining whatever class levels it had in life.  Immunity to Magic (Su) A marrowstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the golem, as noted below.  • A transmute rock to mud spell slows a marrowstone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  • Effects that heal undead heal half that amount of damage to a marrowstone golem, to a limit of its full normal hit points.  • A marrowstone golem that fails its save against a magical attack that deals positive energy damage (including the channel energy ability when used to harm undead, but not when used to heal living creatures) does not take any damage from the attack, but it loses its create spawn ability, its necrotic field aura, and the negative energy damage from its slam attack for 1d4 rounds.  Necrotic Field (Su) Undead within 30 feet of a marrowstone golem gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws, increase the save DCs of their extraordinary and supernatural abilities by 2, and gain a +4 bonus to channel resistance. Positive energy effects cause only half damage to a creature within the marrowstone golem's aura. Their aura particularly strengthens ghouls and ghasts, giving them a +2 bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.

Deadly Embrace (Ex) A mihstu that pins an opponent completely surrounds that creature and deals 1d2 Constitution damage every round as it siphons away blood, tears, and other vital fluids. Maintaining a pin is a free action for a mihstu and it does not gain the grappled condition (allowing it to attack other creatures with its tentacles).  Susceptible to Cold (Ex) Magical cold stuns a mihstu rather than damaging it. If the creature fails its save against a magical cold effect, it is stunned for 1 round and then staggered for an additional 1d4 rounds.  Wind Defense (Ex) The churning winds of a mihstu's body automatically deflect nonmagical projectiles (such as arrows, bolts, and sling stones). All other ranged weapons (including magical projectiles and thrown weapons) have a 20% miss chance. Weapons of significant size, such as giant-thrown boulders, siege engine projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected by this ability.																												
Mohrg	8.00	4800	Medium	8	23, touch 15, flat-footed 18	91	6	10	9				30 ft.	2 slams +15 (2d8+5 plus grab), tongue +10 melee touch (paralysis)		5 ft.	5 ft.	create spawn, paralysis (1d4 minutes, DC 21)	Str 21, Dex 19, Con -, Int 11, Wis 10, Cha 14	10	+15 (+19 grapple)	30	PFRPG Bestiary	Create Spawn (Su) Humanoid creatures killed by a mohrg rise immediately as fast zombies under the mohrg's control. The sudden bloom of unlife when a mohrg's victim dies and becomes a zombie causes a surge of negative energy to flow through the mohrg. Whenever a mohrg creates a zombie in this manner, it is healed 1d6 hit points per HD possessed by the slain creature and acts as if hasted for the round immediately following the spawn's creation.																												
Moonflower	8.00	4800	Huge	4	21, touch 8, flat-footed 21	104	12	3	4			vulnerable to fire	20 ft.	bite +15 (2d6+9 plus grab), 2 tentacles +13 (1d8+4)		15 ft.	15 ft.	light pulse, pod prison	Str 28, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 5, Wis 12, Cha 17	8	+19 (+23 grapple)	29 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Light Pulse (Su) As a standard action, a moonflower can release a pulse of bright light. All creatures within a 50- foot burst that can see the moonflower must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Moonflowers are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Pod Prison (Ex) This works like the swallow whole ability, except the moonflower can only use it once every 1d4 rounds, and the swallowed creature is immediately wrapped in a tight digestive cocoon and expelled into an adjacent square, where it takes damage every round (2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 acid, AC 15, 25 hp). The cocooned target cannot use Escape Artist to get out of the cocoon. Other creatures can aid the target by attacking the cocoon with piercing or slashing weapons, but the creature within takes half the damage from any attack against the cocoon. Once the cocoon is destroyed, it deflates and decays. Each creature swallowed by a moonflower is encased in its own cocoon.  Pod Spawn (Ex) Should a moonflower's pod prison kill and digest a Small or larger creature, the pod transforms into an adult moonflower with full hit points after 1d4 hours. The newly formed moonflower has its own consciousness, but some aspect of its trunk or blossoms resembles the creature that died within. The dead creature's equipment remains inside the new moonflower and can be retrieved by killing it.

Goblins, goblin dogs, worgs, hell hounds, and barghests gain double the normal bonuses from this ability.  Improved Bite (Ex) A mythic barghest's bite has a critical threat range of 18-20 and critical multiplier of x3.  Vorpal Bite (Su) If a mythic greater barghest confirms a critical hit against a non-mythic opponent, it can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to bite off the opponent's head, instantly killing it (Fort DC 15 negates).

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Power Lift (Ex) A mythic wyvern can expend one use of mythic power to withdraw as a move action (instead of a full-round action), moving up to its speed instead of double. It can even move straight up. If it's grappling a creature, the wyvern can bring the grappled creature with it. Usually a wyvern uses this ability to carry off its prey and drop it from above onto a hard surface. Since this is a move action, the wyvern can damage its target, withdraw, and drop its target all in the same round.																												
Nabasu	8.00	4800	Medium	7	22, touch 14, flat-footed 18	103	9	9	9		19		30 ft., fly 60 ft.

It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, caster level checks, and skill checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 10 for each growth point, and its caster level for spell-like abilities increases by 1. For every 2 growth points, its natural armor bonus, SR, and CR increase by 1. Every time it gains a growth point it makes a DC 30 caster level check-success indicates it matures (gaining both the advanced and the giant simple templates) and plane shifts to the Abyss in a burst of smoke. A nabasu can have a maximum of 20 growth points-it automatically matures if it has not done so already when it reaches 20 growth points. Death-Stealing Gaze (Su) As a free action once per day per growth point (minimum of 1/day), a nabasu can activate its deathstealing gaze for a full round. All living creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner immediately transforms into a ghoul under the nabasu's control. A nabasu's gaze can only create one ghoul per round-if multiple humans perish from the gaze in a round, the nabasu picks which human becomes a ghoul. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Necromantic Golem	8.00	4800	Large	0	21, touch 9, flat-footed 21	90	3	3	5				30 ft.	2 slams +14 (2d6+4 plus 1d6 negative energy)		10 ft.	10 ft.	enervating ray, unholy blast	Str 18, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 1	11	6	17	Tome of Horrors 4	Enervating Ray (Su) Once per day, a necromantic golem can unleash a ray of negative energy in a 30-foot line. A creature struck must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or gain 2d4 negative levels. Even on a successful save, the victim gains 1d4 negative levels. Assuming the target survives, it regains lost levels after 11 hours have passed. Negative levels from a necromantic golem do not have a chance of becoming permanent. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A necromantic golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: A magical attack that heals living creatures slows a necromantic golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). A magical attack that deals negative energy damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A necromantic golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal negative energy damage. A raise dead spell deals 6d6 points of damage to a necromantic golem. A necromantic golem gets no saving throw against this effect. A resurrection or true resurrection spell negates its DR and immunity to magic for 1 minute. In an area affected by a hallow spell, a necromantic golem takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, checks, and saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. In areas affected by an unhallow spell, a necromantic golem gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, checks, and saves, and a +2 bonus to AC.  Rejuvenation (Su) A necromantic golem heals 1 hit point every hour up to its maximum hit points. If reduced to 0 hit points or less, the golem continues to heal. A necromantic golem can be permanently destroyed by reducing it to 0 hit points or less, casting a hallow spell on the corpse, and dousing the golem with holy water.  Unholy Blast (Su) As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, a necromantic golem can unleash a blast of negative  take 6d6 points of negative energy damage (good-aligned outsiders caught in the area take 6d8 points of negative energy damage). A DC 15 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Each stored brain grants a neh-thalggu a cumulative +1 insight bonus to AC, concentration checks, and Knowledge checks. A neh-thalggu can extract a brain from a helpless opponent with a coup de grace attack, or as a standard action from a body that has been dead for no more than 1 minute. A neh-thalggu that has fewer than seven brains gains one negative level for each missing brain. These negative levels can never become permanent, but they can only be removed by replacing one of its collected brains. The stats presented here assume a monster with a full collection.

Nephilim	8.00	4800	Large	2	22, touch 11, flat-footed 20	104	13	7	10	soul of sorrow	19		40 ft.

The save DC is Strength-based.  Mortal Challenge (Su) When a nephilim spends a standard action to roar a battle challenge, all humanoids and monstrous humanoids within 100 feet of the nephilim must make a DC 18 Will save to avoid becoming frightened for 5d6 rounds. On a successful save, the creatures only become shaken for that time. Creatures with more HD than the nephilim become shaken if they fail their save, and suffer no effect if they succeed. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to that nephilim's mortal challenge for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Soul of Sorrow (Ex) A nephilim gains a +2 bonus on Will saves against fear effects and any effect that causes sorrow.

Any melee hit deals acid damage. Creatures attacking an ooze golem unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the ooze golem's slam attack. Amorphous (Ex) An ooze golem's body is malleable and shapeless. It can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or oneeight its space when squeezing. Death Throes (Ex) When an ooze golem is reduced to 0 or less hit points its body collapses into a bubbling pool of acidic slime that covers a 10-foot square area. Creatures touching this acidic pool take 2d6 points of acid damage (no save) for 1d3 rounds. The acid pool remains for 10 rounds (1 minute) before dispersing. Fast Healing (Ex) An ooze golem heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.																												
Phantasm	8.00	4800	Medium	9	18, touch 18, flat-footed 13	114	11	11	12	incorporeal			fly 60 ft. (perfect)	incorporeal touch +17 (1d6+2 plus energy drain)		5 ft.	5 ft.	energy drain (1 level, DC 19), possession	Str -, Dex 21, Con -, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 16	9	9	24	Tome of Horrors Complete	Possession (Su) Once per round, by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a phantasm can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it doesn't require a receptacle. If the attack succeeds, the phantasm's body vanishes into the opponent's body. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 21). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that phantasm's possession ability for one day.  A possessing phantasm automatically deals one negative level (from its energy drain ability) each round. A possessed creature can attempt a Will save (DC 19) each round to force the phantasm out of its body. If successful, the phantasm is ejected from the host and cannot attempt to possess the same host for 1 minute. If turned or subjected to a dismissal spell while possessing a host, the phantasm is likewise ejected. The save DCs are Charisma-based.																												
Plague Locust Swarm	8.00	4800	Fine	4	22, touch 22, flat-footed 18	90	11	8	5	swarm traits			10 ft., climb 10 ft., fly 40 ft.

Voracious (Ex) A plague locust swarm's swarm attack deals double damage to creatures of the plant type and to objects made of paper, wood, or other plant materials.																												
Pod-Spawned Guard Captain	8.00	4800	Medium	5	20, touch 11, flat-footed 19	90	8	4	0	bravery +2			30 ft.	#ERROR!	mwk light crossbow +12 (1d8+1/19-20/x2)	5 ft.	5 ft.	weapon training (heavy blades +2, crossbows +1)	Str 19, Dex 13, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 4	9	2	11	PFRPG Bestiary 4																													
Proto-Creature	8.00	4800	Medium	-1	21, touch 9, flat-footed 21	125	11	6	7	ferocity			30 ft.	2 slams +16 (1d6+5 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	acidic sweat (1d6 acid)	Str 20, Dex 9, Con 22, Int 6, Wis 10, Cha 5	10	+15 (+19 grapple)	24	Tome of Horrors 4	Acidic Sweat (Ex) The metabolism and biology of a protocreature has been so corrupted, that unidentifiable caustic fluids now course through its body instead of the traditional humors. In the third round of combat or heavy exertion, a proto-creature begins to secrete this fluid through the pores of its skin as sweat. Anyone physically touching a protocreature (not including with a weapon or other object) or who is hit by a slam attack after this sweating begins takes 1d6 acid damage. An opponent that is grappled by a proto-creature takes double this damage each round that the grapple is maintained. A living proto-creature continues to sweat this substance for 10 minutes following the completion of the battle or other activity that initiated it.																												
Pyropiscis	8.00	4800	Large	6	22, touch 11, flat-footed 20	105	11	9	5			lava dependency, vulnerable to cold	10 ft., burrow 60 ft. (through lava or magma only)	bite +17 (2d8+10/19-20 plus burn and grab)	lava bomb +11 (3d6 plus 2d6 fire)	10 ft.	10 ft.	burn (1d6, DC 19), searing bite	Str 24, Dex 14, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 6	10	+18 (+22 grapple)	30	AP 95	Hibernation (Ex) A pyropiscis can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time in order to survive longer periods away from a source of lava. Entering a state of hibernation takes 1 hour, during which the pyropiscis encases itself in a thick layer of igneous stone. While hibernating, a pyropiscis doesn't need to breathe, drink, or eat. The stone casing has hardness 8 and 90 hit points. As long as the casing remains intact, the pyropiscis within remains unharmed. The pyropiscis remains in a state of hibernation until it senses lava (or another source of extreme heat) nearby, at which point it breaks out of its case over the course of 1d4 minutes.  Lava Bomb (Ex) Like an active volcano, a pyropiscis can spit a lava bomb-a blob of molten rock-as a ranged attack (range increment 30 feet). If a lava bomb hits, it deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage to its target.  Lava Dependency (Ex) A pyropiscis can breathe indefinitely while submerged in lava. It can survive out of lava for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this limit, the pyropiscis runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were drowning.  Searing Bite (Ex) A pyropiscis's searing-hot jaws are designed to bind readily to flesh, giving it a firm grasp on its prey. This functions as the constrict ability, except that a pyropiscis deals 2d6 points of fire damage when it makes a successful grapple check, rather than dealing bludgeoning damage.  Sprint (Ex) Once per minute, a pyropiscis may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40 feet for 1 round.																												
Quickwood	8.00	4800	Huge	3	19, touch 7, flat-footed 19	95	12	2	5	spell absorption	19 (see spell absorption)		10 ft.	bite +14 (2d6+9), 3 roots +12 (1d6+4 plus pull)		5 ft.	15 ft. (60 ft. with root)	pull (root, 10 ft.)	Str 29, Dex 8, Con 21, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 12	7	18	27 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Fear Aura (Su) A quickwood with stored magical energy can activate its fear aura as a standard action. The aura has a radius of 10 feet per spell level of the effect and lasts for 1 round (Will DC 20 negates). Creatures that fail their saving throws become panicked for 1 minute. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  Oaksight (Su) A quickwood may observe the area surrounding any oak tree within 360 feet as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance. It can use this ability on any number of oak trees in the area. Although the quickwood does not need line of sight to establish this link, if it does have line of sight to even a single oak tree, it cannot be flanked.  Roots (Ex) A quickwood has dozens of long roots, but can only attack with up to three of them in any given round. If the quickwood uses its pull ability to pull a target within reach of its bite attack, it can immediately make a free bite attack with a +4 bonus on its attack roll against that target.  Spell Absorption (Su) If a quickwood's spell resistance protects it from a magical effect, the creature absorbs that magical energy into its body. It can release this energy to activate its fear aura ability. While the plant is storing a spell, its SR decreases by 5. It can only store one spell at a time.																												
Quickwood	8.00	4800	Huge	3	17, touch 7, flat-footed 17	104	12	4	7				10 ft.	9 roots melee touch +16 (grab) and bite +15  (2d6+13)		15 ft.	15 ft. (60 ft. with roots)	grasping roots	Str 29, Dex 9, Con 21, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 12	8	+19 (+23 grapple)	28 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Fear Aura (Su) If a quickwood is targeted by a spell (excluding area spells) and it makes its save against the spell's effects, it takes no damage and absorbs some of the spell's energy and releases it as a fear effect (as a free action) in a 10-foot radius per level of the spell. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be affected as by a fear spell (caster level 11th). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.  Grasping Roots (Ex) If a quickwood hits with a root attack, it can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and drags the foe 30 feet closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack of opportunity). A quickwood can draw in a creature within 15 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus in the same round. A root has hardness 2 and 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a quickwood's root does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the root is currently grappling a target, the quickwood takes a -4 penalty on its CMD to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a root deals no damage to a quickwood.  Immunity to Fire (Ex) A quickwood can perspire as a free action; this grants it immunity to fire for one hour.  Afterwards, it must wait one minute before using this ability again.  Remote Sensing (Su) As a standard action, a quickwood can use a normal oak tree within 360 feet as a magical sensor to view its surroundings. This ability is similar to a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and allows a quickwood to see (including with darkvision) and hear through a sensor. A quickwood does not need line of sight to establish a sensor. A quickwood can establish a new magical sensor in another tree within range as a free action, though it can never have more sensors at one time than its Hit Dice. A quickwood with multiple sensors can switch between them as a free action.  An oak tree utilized as a magical sensor takes on a human-like visage (similar to a quickwood). A successful DC 20 Perception check allows a character to notice the tree's visage.																												
Rawbones	8.00	4800	Medium	6	18, touch 12, flat-footed 16	91	8	8	10	channel resistance +2			30 ft.	2 slams +15 (1d8+4) or entrails lash +14 (1d4+4 plus  grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.

Any creature that comes within that area must succeed on DC 19 Fortitude save or become nauseated for as long as they remain within the area a 1 minute after leaving the area.  A creature that makes a successful save is immune to the nauseating aura of that rawbones for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Strangulation (Ex) When a rawbones hits an opponent of up to one size larger with its entrails lash, it can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it succeeds on its grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage per round in addition to normal damage to the grappled opponent each round that the hold is maintained.  Vomit Gore (Su) Three times per day, a rawbones can spit a blast of blood and gore in a 20-foot cone that deals 7d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half). The save DC is Charisma-based.

In addition to dealing slashing damage the salt crystals absorb bodily fluids, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage to living targets.																												
Sand Kraken	8.00	4800	Large	4	21, touch 9, flat-footed 21	100	12	6	4				10 ft.	10 tentacles +13 (1d4+5 plus grab) or bite +8 (2d6+2)		10 ft.	10 ft. (20 ft. with tentacle)	constrict (1d6+5)	Str 20, Dex 11, Con 23, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 1	8	14	24 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Camouflage (Ex) Because it remains buried until it attacks, it takes a successful DC 20 Perception check to detect the presence of a sand kraken before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the sand kraken.  Tentacles (Ex) The only part of a sand kraken that is normally exposed is its tentacles. For combat purposes, the creature's tentacles are treated as separate weapons.  A single tentacle has an AC 20 (touch 14) and 15 hit points. Once a tentacle takes more than 15 hit points of damage, it is destroyed. A sand kraken can no longer use the destroyed tentacle to make attacks, however the loss of a tentacle cause the creature no other penalties.  Furthermore, damage dealt to a tentacle does not count against the creature's total hit points. Lost tentacles regrow in 1d4 days.																												
Sandpoint Devil	8.00	4800	Large	3	22, touch 13, flat-footed 18	114	12	7	11		19		40 ft., fly 60 ft.

This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not their saves are successful, creatures within the effect are immune to the Sandpoint Devil's bay for 24 hours thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Hellfire Breath (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, the Sandpoint Devil can unleash a blast of infernal flame from its mouth as a standard action. This hellfire fills a 30-foot cone and deals 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 half ). Anyone who takes damage from this breath weapon must also succeed at a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming cursed by the infernal flames. Those who become cursed take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for a number of days equal to the damage taken, and during this time, the victim's skin appears to be horribly burned in places regardless of any healing applied. This curse effect functions at caster level 12th. The save DC for both saves is Constitution-based.  Kick (Ex) The Sandpoint Devil's hoof attacks are primary attacks that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.																												
Sentinel Hut	8.00	4800	Huge	3	21, touch 11, flat-footed 18	95	3	6	3	dancing evasion			30 ft.	bite +15 (2d4+7 plus grab), slam +15 (2d6+7)		15 ft.	15 ft.	stir crazy, swallow whole (1d2 Wisdom damage, AC 15, 9 hp), trample (2d6+10, DC 22)	Str 25, Dex 17, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 16	10	+19 (+23 grapple)	32	Irrisen Land Of Eternal Winter	Dancing Evasion (Ex) The sentinel hut's dancing and hopping movements give it a +3 bonus on all Reflex saves.  Immune to Magic (Ex) Sentinel huts are immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with the exception of spells with the fire descriptor, which affect it normally.  Stir Crazy (Su) A victim swallowed whole by a sentinel hut is trapped in a plain, 10-foot-square room. A trapped creature is not considered grappled, and can move freely about the room. Every round, it is bombarded with a powerful psychic force that causes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage. To escape, the victim must deal damage on the sentinel hut's door (AC 15, 12 hp). Damage dealt to any part of the interior other than the door still adds to the damage dealt to the construct overall, but won't free the victim. If sufficient damage is dealt to the hut to destroy it (from without or within), the trapped creature is freed, but must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be afflicted by insanity (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250). Victims who break through the door from within are not subject to this latter effect.

The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Dread (Su) Creatures viewing a sepulchral guardian must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become shaken as long as the sepulchral guardian is "alive" and within 100 feet and for 2d4 rounds afterwards. A successful save renders the target immune to the guardian's dread for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Creatures in the area take 8d6 points of fire damage. A successful DC 19 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Heat (Ex) A seraph generates so much heat that its mere touch deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. A seraph's metallic weapons also conduct this heat. A seraph can start or stop this ability as a free action once per round on its turn.

Feeding (Ex) As a free action while a shalkeshka is burrowed beneath the ground, it can go into a dormant state and leech nutrients from the soil. During this time, the shalkeshka regains hit points at a rate of 5 hit points per hour. While in this state, the creature can't move, doesn't have to eat or drink, and is considered flat-footed for the first full round of combat if interrupted from its dormancy.  Pit Surge (Ex) A shalkeshka can burrow into dirt, sand, or loose soil to lie in ambush 30 feet beneath the surface. It monitors the area above it using tremorsense, awaiting a victim's movement into the area. When it detects prey, the shalkeshka can surge to the surface as a standard action and make a single bite attack. This action creates a 30-foot-deep pit where the shalkeshka was laying in wait. All creatures standing in the area above must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save to jump to safety in the nearest open space to the edge of the newly formed pit. Creatures that fail this Reflex save fall into the pit, taking damage as normal. The pit's walls have a climb DC of 25. The shalkeshka (along with any creature it may have grappled) can stay above ground by making a successful saving throw, or voluntarily fall back into the pit. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

It can withdraw this protection as a free action.  Slippery (Ex) A shantak's scales seep slippery slime.  This grants the creature a +8 bonus on all Escape Artist checks and to its CMD against grapples, and imparts a -5 penalty on all Ride checks made by creatures attempting to ride a shantak.  Starflight (Su) A shantak can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion)- provided the shantak knows the way to its destination.																												
Shard Slag	8.00	4800	Huge	-2	20, touch 6, flat-footed 20	126	10	2	-1			vulnerable to cold and water	30 ft., burrow 20 ft.	1d4+2 slag blades +13 (1d8+6/19-20 plus 2d6 fire)		15 ft.	15 ft.	excruciating burn (DC 16), molten form, slag blades	Str 22, Dex 6, Con 23, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	9	17	25 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Burrow (Ex) A shard slag can burrow through solid stone at half its normal burrow speed.  Excruciating Burn (Ex) A living creature that takes fire damage from a shard slag must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. This is a fire effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Molten Form (Ex) A shard slag's molten metal body is hot enough to melt stone. Creatures that begin their turn within 5 feet of a shard slag take 1d6 points of fire damage. Anyone striking a shard slag with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a shard slag or is grappled by one takes 3d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists. A creature that strikes a shard slag with a weapon can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save; if it fails, it's unable to pull the weapon away from the shard slag's molten body quickly enough, and the weapon takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects in contact with a shard slag take 2d6 points of fire damage per round. Damage caused to weapons and unattended objects is not halved, and ignores the first 5 points of hardness. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Slag Blades (Ex) Each round, a shard slag manipulates its molten metal form to create 1d4+2 blade-like protrusions it can extend to attack prey. The slag blades each strike as Medium longswords that deal an additional 2d6 points of fire damage. Additionally, the slag blades are natural weapons, so a shard slag can use them to attack creatures it grapples. Due to a shard slag's constantly roiling molten body, the slag blades melt away at the end of the shard slag's turn each round to be immediately replaced by 1d4+2 new slag blades.  Vulnerable to Water (Ex) If a significant amount of water- such as the contents of a large bucket, the liquid created by a create water spell, or a blow from a water elemental- strikes a shard slag, the creature must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d6 rounds. A shard slag that is immersed in water is automatically staggered and must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (this DC increases by 1 each subsequent round) or be petrified, reverting to its molten metal form once the water is gone.

It can make one extra attack per round as a full attack action, but each attack receives a -2 penalty.  Rend Armor (Ex) If a slaughterford hits with both arm blades, it pulls apart any armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+6 points of damage to the opponent's armor.  Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.  Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful Craft (armorsmithing) check.																												
Soucouyant	8.00	4800	Medium	10	23, touch 17, flat-footed 16	102	7	14	11		19		30 ft.	bite +16 (2d6+4), 2 claws +17 (1d6+4 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	blood drain (1d2 Constitution)	Str 18, Dex 22, Con 17, Int 14, Wis 17, Cha 19	12	+18 (+22 grapple)	33	Isles Of The Shackles	Detonate (Su) As a standard action, a soucouyant in her fiery form can choose to explode in a 30-foot-radius burst of fire that deals 8d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half damage) to all creatures in the area. Using this ability returns a soucouyant to her humanoid form.  Fiery Form (Su) As a standard action, a soucouyant who has removed her skin can assume the form of a flying ball of fire similar to that created by a flaming sphere spell (CL 8th) for up to 8 rounds. Upon returning to humanoid form, a soucouyant must wait 1d4 rounds before she can assume fiery form again. A soucouyant who enters the same space as a creature stops moving for that round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to the creature unless it succeeds at a DC 18 Reflex save. A soucouyant in fiery form retains her usual AC, but is immune to nonmagical attacks and effects. A successful targeted dispel magic spell or dealing 20 points of cold damage to a soucouyant in fiery form forces her to return to her humanoid form. A soucouyant can assume fiery form a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (6 for most soucouyants). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Mask Evil (Su) During the day, a soucouyant has the appearance of an old woman, an illusion created by an effect like alter self; at night the illusion fades, revealing her monstrous nature. While she is "wearing" her skin, a soucouyant's evil nature is masked as though by a constant undetectable alignment spell.

Animated rocks are vaguely humanoid-shaped (most often resembling a stone maiden) and use the same statistics as stone maidens. They do not possess a stone maiden's animate rocks ability, spell-like abilities, or veil special quality. They can move through a spike stoned area unimpeded and without taking damage.  An animated rock loses its ability to move if the stone maiden that animated it is incapacitated or moves out of range.  Earth Mastery (Ex) A stone maiden gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the stone maiden takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex) A stone maiden is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects with the earth descriptor, including spells of the Earth domain.  One with the Earth (Ex) A stone maiden is so closely tied with the earth that any damage it takes from the natural attacks of an earth or stone creature (one formed of earth or stone or one with the earth subtype) is considered nonlethal damage.  Veil (Su) Each stone maiden is mystically bound to her veil and never lets it out of her possession. If she is ever more than 1,000 feet from it, she weakens (-4 effective penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) and dies within 4d6 hours, crumbling to dust. If her veil is ever destroyed (hardness 3, hp 10) shed ies within 1 minute. A stone maiden's veil does not radiate magic.																												
Stymphalidies	8.00	4800	Large	6	22, touch 11, flat-footed 20	94	11	10	5			vulnerable to sonic	20 ft., fly 120 ft.

Any creature within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d6 minutes. A creature can defend against this effect in the same way it would a gaze attack. This is a sight-based effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Wing Razors (Ex) A stymphalidies's metallic feathers are razor-sharp. In addition to being able to slash creatures with its wings as a melee attack, it may beat its wings, flinging two large, feathered shards at a single target. These wing razors deal 2d6 points of damage and cause bleed, with a range increment of 50 feet. A stymphalidies can use this attack a number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier (5 times per day for most stymphalidies).																												
Svartalfar	8.00	4800	Medium	5	20, touch 15, flat-footed 15	84	6	13	12		19	light blindness	40 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	bane, quickened spell strike, sneak attack +3d6	Str 12, Dex 21, Con 17, Int 18, Wis 14, Cha 21	6	11	22	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Bane (Su) Once per day as a swift action, a svartalfar can imbue one of its weapons with the bane weapon special ability. It must select one creature type (and subtype, if choosing humanoid or outsider) when it uses this ability. This lasts for 1 hour. This ability only functions while the svartalfar wields the weapon.  Quickened Spell Strike (Su) Three times per day as a free action after hitting with a melee weapon, a svartalfar can cast and deliver one of the following of its spell-like abilities through the weapon: chill touch, corrosive touch, force punch, frigid touch, or ray of exhaustion. If the attack is a critical hit and the spell-like ability deals damage, it deals double damage.																												
Tenebrous Worm	8.00	4800	Medium	7	21, touch 13, flat-footed 18	105	14	6	2	bristles			20 ft.	bite +14 (2d6+4 plus 6d6 acid)		5 ft.	5 ft.	poison	Str 17, Dex 16, Con 20, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 7	10	1	14	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Acid (Su) The acid of a tenebrous worm's bite affects only organic matter-as it dissolves creatures, it converts their flesh to shadow that swiftly fades away, leaving raw, jagged wounds behind. In dim light, acid damage dealt by a tenebrous worm's bite increases to 8d6 points of damage, while in darkness or bright light, the acid damage is reduced to 4d6.  Bristles (Su) Long bristles of shadowstuff extend from between the tenebrous worm's armor plates. These bristles react swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any creature that attempts to harm the worm. Each time a creature attacks a tenebrous worm, it must make a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid being punctured by several bristles. Each time a creature is punctured by these bristles, it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the tenebrous worm's poison. A creature that grapples a tenebrous worm is automatically hurt by these bristles. The save DC to avoid the bristles is Dexterity-based.  Poison (Su) Bristles-injury; save Fort DC 20, frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds, effect paralysis for 1d4 rounds plus 1d2 Con (the duration of the paralysis is cumulative with each failed save), cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Thorgothrel	8.00	4800	Large	4	21, touch 9, flat-footed 21	100	7	4	2				20 ft.	2 slams +11 (1d6+6 plus bleed)	force ray +5 ranged touch (10d6 force)	10 ft.	10 ft.	atavistic manipulation, bleed (1 Int damage), force ray	Str 22, Dex 10, Con 17, Int 17, Wis 16, Cha 11	6	5	17	AP 87	Atavistic Manipulation (Su) A thorgothrel can alter a target's genetic structure to induce rapid evolutionary regression by dealing Intelligence bleed damage with its slam attacks. As the target mentally regresses, it also becomes more feral and violent. A target that has taken at least 4 points of Intelligence damage from a thorgothrel gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. If a thorgothrel spends an hour experimenting on a target rendered unconscious due to Intelligence damage, it can make this regression permanent. Thereafter, the target's Intelligence score is reduced to 1. This regression can be reversed only with heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish. At the GM's discretion, the target might change in additional ways to reflect its atavistic regression.  Force Field (Ex) A thorgothrel with a silver armature is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants 40 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a thorgothrel with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the thorgothrel is immune to critical hits. A thorgothrel's force field has fast healing 10, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and can only be reactivated if the thorgothrel spends a full-round action and succeeds at a DC 15 Disable Device check. If successful, the force field reactivates with 1 hit point.  Force Ray (Ex) As a standard action, a thorgothrel can lose 5 hit points from its force field (if it has that many or more remaining) in order to fire a ray of force at any target within 100 feet. The ray is a ranged touch attack that deals 10d6 points of force damage.  Poisonous Sublimation (Ex) When a thorgothrel without an active force field is in a region with breathable atmosphere, it beings to evaporate into a poisonous mist. The thorgothrel takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round at the beginning of its turn, and the mist expands to fill a 20-foot radius. Any living creature in the mist with 6 or fewer HD must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be slain. A creature with more than 6 HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round while in the mist (Fortitude half). A moderate wind disperses the mist in 4 rounds; a strong wind disperses the mist in 1 round. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.

Force Field (Ex) A field of shimmering energy surrounds a torturer robot. Damage dealt to the robot is applied to the force field first. As long as the field is active, the robot is immune to critical hits. The force field has fast healing 8, but once the field's hit points are reduced to 0, the field collapses and does not reactive for 24 hours.  Interrogate (Ex) As a standard action, the torturer robot can attempt a Heal check to deal 1d4 points of damage to an ability of its choice possessed by an adjacent, helpless target.  A successful Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to the robot's Heal check result negates this damage.  Nanosurgeon (Ex) As a standard action, a torturer robot can inject purpose-programmed nanites into a target as a melee touch attack. The nanites produce one of the following effects or conditions (CL 10th, where applicable): cure serious wounds, lesser restoration, neutralize poison, remove disease, exhaustion, nauseated for 1d4 rounds, or paralyzed (nauseated targets only, for remainder of original duration).  If the victim succeeds at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw, exhaustion is reduced to fatigue, nauseated is reduced to sickened, and other effects are negated. The torturer robot carries 5 doses of nanites, and it constructs replacements at a rate of 1 dose per hour. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  Surgical Lasers (Ex) The torturer robot's lasers have a range of 50 feet with no range increment, and threaten a critical hit on a 19 or 20. Lasers pass through transparent creatures and objects without causing harm (including force fields, force effects, and invisible creatures; it can pass through glass, but the glass takes damage), and can strike targets behind them normally. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks.

The trapper attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals buffet damage each round the hold is maintained. Further, a grappled opponent must hold its breath or suffocate. Attacks that hit a smothering trapper deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.

It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the treant's animation and rockthrowing abilities), gaining the treant's vulnerability to fire. If the treant that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state. Double Damage Against Objects (Ex) A treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. Treespeech (Ex) A treant has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an attitude of friendly or helpful.

The blast deals 8d6 points of damage to a single target if it fails a DC 24 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Spell Reflection (Su) Any spell that fails to overcome a uggoth's spell resistance is reflected back on the caster who becomes the target of the spell. Area spells still affect the area around the uggoth, but the portion that would affect it is reflected back on the caster.  Tentacles (Ex) A uggoth's tentacles are always primary attacks for the creature.																												
Undead Fire Elemental	8.00	4800	Medium	8	20, touch 15, flat-footed 15	102	7	8	8	chill shield			50 ft.	slam +13 (1d6+4 plus 1d6 cold and coldfire)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 16, Dex 19, Con -, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 16	9	12	27	Tome of Horrors 4	Chill Shield (Su) In addition to being immune to cold and fire, the flames that wreath an undead fire elemental also act as a fire shield spell. Any creature striking the undead fire elemental with a natural or handheld weapon takes 1d6+12 points of cold damage. This effect cannot be dispelled.  Coldfire (Su) Each time an undead fire elemental successfully hits a living creature, that creature must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or catch on fire from the elemental's cold flames. These flames deal 1d6 Strength damage per round as the life-giving heat is snuffed from its body. The afflicted creature is entitled to a new saving throw each round. This coldfire burns for 1d6 rounds or until a successful save is made. Resistance to cold or fire does not prevent this damage, though death ward does. The save is Charisma based.  Snuff (Ex) As a standard action (that does not provoke an attack of opportunity), an undead fire elemental can extinguish itself, thereby reducing itself to the form of its base component - a small pile of cold ashes. The undead fire elemental will rarely do this while in the presence of other creatures because of the inherent vulnerability involved. If the cold ash can be scooped up and placed in a stoppered container, the undead fire elemental is trapped until released. Likewise if the ash pile is exposed to winds of 50 mph or greater, the undead fire elemental's material form is dispersed, and it is unable to manifest its burning form again until it is able to reform its ash pile - a process usually taking several years. While in its ash pile form, an undead fire elemental can burst into its burning form as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

The target creature can resist this attempt with a DC 22 Reflex save. On a failure, the target treats the urannag's space as difficult terrain, but cannot move out of that space or up more than 10 feet. Each round a creature remains encaged, it takes 2d6 slashing damage from the sharpened gears and blades thrashing and whirring inside the creature. A creature can escape being encaged by making a successful CMB check or Escape Artist check (DC = the urannag's CMD) as a full-round action, or can smash through a cage wall. These walls are AC 22, have hardness 10, and 22 hp-once a hole is smashed into a wall, it automatically repairs itself the next time the urannag encages a foe. The save DC is Strength-based.  Exposed Mechanisms (Ex) Although an urannag is a construct, it can be damaged and harmed by the same methods used to disarm and disable traps. A DC 20 Disable Device check can be attempted against an urannag as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. On a successful check, the urannag takes damage equal to 3d6 + the character's total ranks in Disable Device and it must make a DC 16 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1 round (the damage bypasses the urannag's damage reduction).  Living Trap (Ex) Defensive abilities that apply to traps (such as trap sense) apply against an urannag's attacks.

This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 6d6 points of acid damage (DC 17 Reflex half) to all creatures in a 20-foot radius spread. Additionally, a creature that fails its save takes 3d6 points of acid damage one round after failing its save. Once a vile drake has used its acid breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Disease (Su) Marsh Sickness: Bite-injury; save DC 17 Fort; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Int damage. A creature whose Int score drops below 12 as a result of marsh sickness acts as if affected by a confusion spell (CL 9th) until the disease is cured; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Savage Bite (Ex) A vile drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a vile drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.

Warped One	8.00	4800	Medium	8	21, touch 14, flat-footed 17	105	12	9	9	amorphous, insane	19		30 ft.	4 claws +16 (1d4+6/19-20)		5 ft.	5 ft.	fleshwarping	Str 22, Dex 19, Con 20, Int 12, Wis 5, Cha 15	10	16	30 (34 vs. trip)	The Worldwound	Fleshwarping (Su) A warped one's body constantly shifts and changes as raw Abyssal energies course through it, reshaping and rebuilding it in minor but hideous ways. Once a warped one enters combat, these growing energies begin to alter its statistics in small ways. At the start of a warped one's turn, roll on the following table to see what additional effect its fleshwarping has on it for that round-all of the following mutations have a duration of 1 round unless otherwise noted.  d8 Result  1 Infusion of Chaos: The warped one's body ripples and shifts rapidly as it grows and absorbs fingers, tendrils, sightless eyes, toothless mouths, tumors, and other mostly useless organs out of its body. The warped one gains DR 10/lawful.  2 Enhanced Musculature: The warped one grows much more muscular. It gains a +2 enhancement bonus on melee attack rolls, melee weapon damage, CMB checks, Strength-based checks, and to its CMD.  3 Lean and Swift: The warped one grows lean and agile, with longer legs and additional joints in its limbs. It gains a +2 dodge bonus to its AC, a +2 enhancement bonus on Reflex saves, and its speed increases by 10 feet.  4 Prismatic Scales: Multicolored scales grow from the warped one's flesh. It gains resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10.  5 Razor-Sharp Talons: The warped one's claws grow additional, sharper talons. Its claw attacks gain bleed 1d6.  6 Multiple Eyes: The warped one grows additional eyes and other sensory organs. It gains a +8 bonus on Perception checks and gains all-around vision.  7 Accelerated Metabolism: The warped one sheds its claws and teeth and immediately grows new ones, its wounds heal, and its colors grow brighter. It gains a +2 enhancement bonus on Fortitude saves and immediately heals 3d8+10 points of damage (if it's currently unwounded, it gains these hit points as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour or until depleted).  8 Armor Plating: The warped one grows a thick hide and dark scaly plates granting it DR 5/, and its natural armor bonus increases by +4.  Insanity (Ex) A warped one's mind is completely unhinged, a raw chaos of madness. It uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier, and it is immune to mind-affecting effects. Any attempt to contact a warped one telepathically (including using spells like detect thoughts) produces a backlash effect, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage to the one attempting the contact. A DC 17 Will save negates this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Unstable Summoning (Sp) A warped one can rend the boundaries between worlds to summon creatures to aid it in combat, but it has little control over what sorts of monsters or demons respond to its summonings. When a warped one uses its unstable summoning, there's a 50% chance that a creature (or a group of creatures) arrives to aid the warped one. Creatures summoned in this way are immune to that particular warped one's warp field. To determine the nature of the summoned aid, roll on the table below. This is a 5th-level spell effect.  d8 Result  1 1d4+1 mephits (determine type randomly)  2 1d4+1 Medium elementals (determine type randomly)  3 1d3 salamanders  4 1d3 Large elementals (determine type randomly)  5 1d3 babaus  6 1 shadow demon  7 1 succubus  8 1 warped one  Warp Field (Su) A warped one exudes a field of mental and physical entropic energy to a radius of 30 feet that twists and warps the minds and bodies of all other living creatures. Creatures who begin their turn inside of a warp field must succeed at a DC 17 Will save. Failure indicates that the creature is confused for 1 round and suffers one mutation from the table below. These mutations emerge swiftly and painfully, causing the victim to become sickened for 1 round and to gain one random mutation from the following table for 1 round. Once a creature succeeds at its saving throw against a warp field, it is immune to further effects from that specific warped one's warp field for 24 hours. This is a polymorph effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  d8 Result  1 Club Foot: One of your feet becomes badly deformed. Rreduce your speed by 10 feet.  2 Cataracts: Your eyes film over with cataracts. You are blinded.  3 Demonic Horns: You grow several bony horns from your skull. You must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or any headband or hat you wear becomes broken.  4 Boneless Mass: You fall prone and your movement rate is reduced to 0 feet. You must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round.  5 Twisted Hands: Your hands twist and deform. You drop all held objects and worn rings and cannot use your hands to make attacks or cast spells for 1 round.  6 Twisted Visage: Your face deforms into a hideous mockery. You cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.  7 Malnourished: You become skeletally thin. All worn items (save boots, head, and headband items) drop from your body, and you must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid being entangled in your gear. When you return to your normal shape 1 round later, dropped items remain on the ground in your square.  8 Obesity: You become monstrously obese. Your land speed is reduced to 5 feet. In addition, if you fail a DC 17 Reflex save, any items you have equipped in the armor, belt, body, chest, neck, shoulders, or wrist slots become broken.

Each round, the entangled victim can attempt a CMD check to escape. Upon a failed check, the weaverworm forcibly drags its victim 20 feet toward it.  Paralytic Nails (Ex) A weaverworm's nails secrete a potent paralytic agent. Any creature damaged by its claw attacks must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1 round. In addition, the weaverworm's nails break off in the bodies of those it paralyzes. A paralyzed creature must make another save to avoid being paralyzed again at the beginning of its round, doing so every round until the nail is removed as a full-round action. A weaverworm's nail can be removed with either a DC 12 Strength check, which removes the nail and deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim, or a DC 14 Heal check, which deals no damage. A weaverworm's paralytic nails don't affect any creature that is immune to poison. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Weaver's Song (Su) A weaverworm can play its webs like a grotesque musical instrument. When doing so, all nonweaverworms within 300 feet must make DC 18 Will saves.  Those who make their saves are unaffected. Those who fail are fascinated, and on their turn, move toward the weaverworm by the most direct means available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. A victim within 5 feet of the weaverworm simply stands and listens. This effect continues for as long as the weaverworm performs and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the victim is immune to the same weaverworm's song for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Whirlmaw	8.00	4800	Medium	10	20, touch 16, flat-footed 14	102	8	10	8				10 ft., burrow 10 ft., fly 90 ft.

If the grapple check is successful, the whirlmaw's spinning, sawlike mouth immediately begins to burrow into the flesh of the creature, dealing 4d6+12 points of damage per round until the grapple is broken.  Dust Cloud (Ex) By rapidly beating the leathery flaps of skin attached along its body, a whirlmaw can raise a cloud of debris while using its Hover feat just as if it were a Large creature.  Flying Charge (Ex) When a whirlmaw makes a charge attack while flying, it gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll (rather than the normal +2 bonus), and does not take the normal -2 penalty to Armor Class.  Keen Sight (Ex) A whirlmaw is extremely sharp-sighted. It takes only half the penalty on Perception checks for distance, and can see creatures in open terrain clearly from up to a mile away.

Str 17, Dex 10, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 7	9	+12 (+18 grapple)	22 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Corpse Lure (Ex) By setting a corpse atop its stump and riddling the body with small, extruded filaments, a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can crudely maneuver the corpse, manipulating it like a puppet. The corpse cannot leave the stump or perform complex actions, but is instead used to lure larger prey within range of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's tentacles. The largest corpse a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can manipulate in this fashion is two size categories smaller than itself (thus Tiny creatures for a Medium wolf-in-sheep's-clothing). When a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing uses a corpse like this, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks beyond its normal racial bonus.  Implant (Ex) A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can infest a creature with its eggs in one of two ways. A creature that eats a carcass used by the monster as a corpse lure automatically becomes implanted. Alternatively, up to once per day, a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can implant an egg into a helpless or pinned creature as part of a grapple action. The target can resist being implanted with a DC 19 Fortitude save, but if it fails, the seed gestates and becomes a self-aware creature that slowly steals nourishment from its host before finally exploding free of its host's gut. The parasite can be cut free of the host's belly with a DC 25 Heal check, which takes 1 hour and deals 3d6 slashing damage regardless of success or failure. Remove disease (or any similar effect) also kills an implanted egg.  Wolf-in-Sheep's-Clothing Egg: Infestation-ingestion; save Fort 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage until host reaches 0, then 3d6 damage as parasite bursts free; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing cannot be flanked.  Lure-Growth (Ex) A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can sprout a small furry animal from its stump as a free action. It uses this ability to lure potential prey into range where it then attacks with its tentacles. A creature viewing the lure-growth must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom check to detect the deception. The check DC is Constitution-based.																												
Young Copper Dragon	8.00	4800	Medium	6	22, touch 12, flat-footed 20	85	9	8	8	uncanny dodge			40 ft., fly 150 ft. (average)	bite +13 (1d8+6/19-20), 2 claws +13 (1d6+4), 2 wings +8 (1d4+2)		5 ft.	5 ft.

Deadly Joke (Sp) Once per day, as a standard action, a great wyrm copper dragon can tell a joke that kills. This affects one target, and functions as power word kill. This is a language-dependent sonic effect. Mass Laughter (Sp) An ancient copper dragon can tell a fantastic joke once per day as a standard action. All creatures within 10 feet per age category must make a Will save or laugh for 1 round per age category, as if affected by hideous laughter. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is equal to a 6th-level spell. Slow Aura (Su) An old or older copper dragon is surrounded by an aura of slowness. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon must make a Will save or be affected as per slow for 1 round. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. For great wyrm copper dragons, those opponents that fail their saves are slowed for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. A copper dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action. Slow Breath (Su) Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

Very young-grease; Juvenile-hideous laughter; Adult-stone shape; Old-transmute rock to mud/mud to rock; Ancient-wall of stone; Great wyrm-move earth.

Upon becoming a mature adult, he can also use Disable Device to disarm magic traps as if he had the rogue's Trapfinding class feature. Uncanny Dodge (Ex) A young or older copper dragon is always looking out for an ambush. He can never be caught flat-footed. This ability functions like the rogue ability of the same name.

These treants can be called from any Huge or larger living tree. A green dragon can create a single treant as a standard action, up to a total of 4 treants per day. These treants remain animated for up to 1 hour, at which time they revert to being ordinary trees. Camouflage (Ex) An old or older green dragon can use Stealth to hide in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment. Miasma (Su) An ancient or older green dragon can use its breath weapon to create a cloud of acid as a standard action that deals damage to any creature inside it. The cloud moves with the dragon and has a radius of 20 feet. When it's created, anyone inside this area takes an amount of damage equal to half the dragon's breath weapon, with a Reflex save for half damage. The number of damage dice rolled is halved each round until the result would be less than 1d6. Any creature that starts its turn inside the cloud takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. A strong wind, such as that created by a gust of wind, disperses the cloud in 1 round. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A green dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-entangle; Juvenile-charm person; Adult-suggestion; Old-plant growth; Ancient-dominate person; Great wyrm-command plants.

Magma Breath (Su) Three times per day, an ancient or older magma dragon can breathe a cone of lava instead of fire.

Snow Dependency (Ex) A yuki-onna is staggered if she is ever in an area without snow while her snowstorm aura is suppressed or otherwise not functioning.  Snowstorm (Su) A yuki-onna is surrounded by whirling blasts of snow, even in areas that wouldn't allow for such weather, that comprise a 200-foot-radius spread. Within this area, the snowfall and wind gusts cause a -4 penalty on Perception checks and ranged attacks. The wind itself blows in a clockwise rotation around the yuki-onna, and functions as severe wind (Core Rulebook 439). A yuki-onna is unaffected by snowstorms or blizzards of any kind. Any effect that causes these winds to drop below severe (such as control weather or control winds) cancels the snowstorm effect entirely.

These save DCs are Constitution-based.  Bombs (Ex) As a standard action, an alchemical golem can throw a bomb as a ranged touch attack to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). If the attack misses, treat it as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands. Anyone struck by an alchemical golem's bomb takes 8d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage (determine type randomly). All creatures adjacent to the location where the bomb hits take 1d6 points of energy damage of the same type.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) An alchemical golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the sonic descriptor. Shatter damages an alchemical golem as if it were a crystalline creature.  Splash (Ex) Any strike on an alchemical golem with a non-reach melee weapon deals 1 point of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage (determine type randomly) to the attacker. This amount increases to 1d6 points of damage if the attack is a critical hit.

Each progressive roar has a different effect, depending upon whether it is the first, second, or third of the androsphinx's roars for that day. All of these roars are sonic effects that fill a 60-foot-radius burst, centered on the androsphinx; the save DCs are Charisma-based. Sphinxes are immune to all of the effects of an androsphinx's roars.  First Roar: Affected creatures become frightened for 2d6 rounds (DC 19 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect.  Second Roar: Affected creatures are paralyzed with fear and deafened for 1d4 rounds (DC 19 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect.  Third Roar: Affected creatures take a 2d4 penalty to Strength for 2d4 rounds and take 2d8 points of sonic damage. Creatures smaller than the androsphinx are knocked prone. A DC 19 Fortitude save negates the Strength penalty and being knocked prone.  Spells An androsphinx casts divine spells as a 6th-level cleric. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.

Once an ankhrav uses this ability, the acid damage dealt by the ankhrav's bite attack is reduced by 1d6 for 1 hour. If the ankhrav's bite attack would not deal any acid damage, it cannot spit acid. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Ankhravs, also called "ankheg queens," are fearsome predators most common near the Skittermounds. These six-legged beasts are larger than regular ankhegs, but the most telling difference between them and drones is the pair of razor-sharp, mantislike arms located at the front of the thorax. While these arms provide no locomotive aid- their scissorlike edges are too delicate to support any weight-these additional appendages allow ankhravs to quickly bring down prey that would take ankheg spawn much longer to swarm and slay. Ankhravs are rarely encountered alone, and then only when a young queen travels from her home nest to establish a new colony. In most cases, when they venture from their lairs, ankhravs hunt accompanied by ankheg drones.																												
Aurumvorax	9.00	6400	Small	8	23, touch 15, flat-footed 19	114	14	12	7	ferocity			30 ft., burrow 10 ft.	bite +18 (1d6+5 plus grab), 4 claws +18 (1d4+5 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	rake (4 claws +18, 1d4+5)	Str 21, Dex 18, Con 18, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 11	12	+16 (+24 grapple)	30 (42 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Grab (Ex) An aurumvorax can grab a foe of up to one size category larger than itself (Medium size for most aurumvoraxes). It gains a +8 racial bonus on grapple attempts rather than the normal +4 racial bonus afforded by the grab ability.

Str 25, Dex 8, Con 21, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 12	9	18	27	Tome of Horrors 4	Animate Plants (Sp) A plant guardian can animate any plants of the same type within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two such plants at a time. It takes 1 full round for the plant to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a plant of the same type as the one animating it (exceptions are noted in each entry below), gaining the plant guardian's vulnerability to fire. If the plant guardian that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the plant immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.  Double Damage against Objects (Ex) A plant guardian or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.  Plantspeech (Ex) A plant guardian has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an attitude of friendly or helpful.																												
Baykok	9.00	6400	Medium	10	24, touch 17, flat-footed 17	97	7	11	9				30 ft., fly 60 ft.

A dying creature can resist this attack with a DC 19 Fortitude save. If it fails, the target is instantly slain. If the creature is already dead, it does not make a saving throw, although the body cannot be more than 1 hour dead. A creature subjected to this attack cannot be brought back to life via raise dead (resurrection and more powerful effects work normally). When a baykok devours a soul in this way, it heals 5d6+10 points of damage and becomes hasted for 4 rounds (as if affected by haste). This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Dread Howl (Su) Once per day, a baykok can unleash a bloodcurdling howl. Any living creature within a 30-foot-radius burst becomes paralyzed with fear for 1 round unless it resists with a DC 19 Will save. Any creature that makes this saving throw is instead shaken for 1 round. This is a fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.  Infused Arrows (Su) A baykok creates arrows of bone as it fires its bow-it need not carry arrows as ammunition. These bone arrows do normal damage for arrows fired from the bow, but gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. In addition, each arrow deals an additional 1d6 points of negative energy on a hit. Further, the first creature struck in a round by a baykok's arrow must make a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid being paralyzed for 1d3 rounds. A baykok can fire normal arrows from its bow if it wishes-such arrows, however, do not gain the special negative energy damage or paralysis effects. The DC is Charisma-based.																												
Bedlam	9.00	6400	Large	12	26, touch 18, flat-footed 17	84	8	12	10		20 (vs. spells  with lawful descriptor only)		fly 50 ft.

Lawful creatures caught in the area take 5d8 points of damage and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. Non-lawful and non-chaotic creatures take 3d8 points of damage, but are not staggered. A successful DC 18 Will save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. Chaotic-aligned creatures are immune to this effect.  The save DC is Constitution-based.  Chaotic Resonance (Su): A bedlam emanates an aura of pure chaos; an invisible and ever-changing ring of chaotic energy. This aura disrupts spells and magic items (except those of a chaotic nature) used within 20 feet of the bedlam. Spellcasters in the area must make a successful DC 18 caster level check each time they attempt to cast a spell. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Any magic item used within this area must make a successful DC 18 Fortitude save or lose its magical properties for that round. A new save must be made each round the item remains within the area. These DCs are Constitution-based.  Spells with the chaotic descriptor that are cast within this area function as if they were empowered (as by the Empower Spell feat). Chaotically-aligned weapons chaotic damage while in this aura (e.g., an anarchic weapon deals 3d6 total points of chaotic damage while in this aura). Lawful-aligned weapons are unaffected by this aura and also bypass the bedlam's damage reduction.  Detect Law (Su): A bedlam can continuously detect law as the spell (caster level 10th), though there is no chance of it becoming stunned by overwhelming lawful auras. It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.																												
Bee-Man Of Bellis	9.00	6400	Medium	6	23, touch 17, flat-footed 16	110	8	10	10	amorphous			30 ft., fly 60 ft. (good)	slam +9 touch (3d6 plus poison)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 10, Dex 23, Con 18, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 17	9	9	26	Andoran Birthplace Of Freedom	Apian Emissaries (Sp) The Bee-Man can use bees to duplicate the effect of pryings eye or whispering wind at will (caster level 13th). A successful DC 15 Perception check identifies the presence of the bees that act as the sensors for these spells, but a DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check is required to realize they are behaving under outside influence.  Poison (Ex) Type injury (slam); save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Swarmlike (Ex) The Bee-Man exists as a hive mind controlling a body of swarming bees. He is immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells). This immunity doesn't apply to spells and effects generated by the Bee-Man himself, nor to mind-affecting effects that target single creatures. The Bee-Man takes half again as much damage (+50%) from damaging area effects. He is also susceptible to high winds and is treated as a Diminutive creature for the purposes of determining wind effects.  The Bee-Man can be targeted by spells as if he were a creature of the vermin type.  Taboo Name (Su) Whenever the Bee-Man's full name (Vernon Vestha) is spoken within 13 miles, he hears it as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance. He also learns the speaker's direction and distance.

Str 21, Dex 15, Con -, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 16	9	+15 (+17 grapple)	27	Tome of Horrors Complete	Engulf (Ex) A blood wight can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its body as a standard action. The blood wight attempts a grapple check that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and claws its opponent with a +4 bonus on the attack roll.  Attacks that hit an engulfing blood wight deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.  An engulfed victim must hold its breath as long as it remains trapped or begin to drown.  A trapped victim can break free with a successful grapple check. A Large blood wight's body can engulf 1 Medium, 2 Small, 4 Tiny, 16 Diminutive, or 32 Fine or smaller opponents.

Str 17, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 13, Wis 17, Cha 16	10	13	26	AP 44	Electric Fortitude (Ex) Borutas take no damage from electricity.  Instead, any electricity attack used against a boruta temporarily increases its Constitution score by 1d4 points. The boruta loses these temporary points at the rate of 1 per hour.  Grounding Curse (Su) Any living creature that takes damage from a boruta's claws must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or have hundreds of tiny seed pods injected into its body.  These seeds grow rapidly; they explode through the victim's skin on its next turn, dealing 1d6 points of damage and entangling it as runners and vines grow from its flesh and root themselves in the ground. The victim cannot move unless it makes a DC 10 Strength check to tear the plants from the ground, but doing so also deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.  Remove curse, blight, diminish plants, and similar spells instantly end this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Treespeech (Ex) A boruta has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an attitude of friendly or helpful.  Wild Shape (Su) A boruta can wild shape three times per day as a 7th-level druid. In any form a boruta takes, its appearance remains plantlike, with wooden features and leaves rather than fur or feathers.

The whirlpool is 50 feet deep and covers a 30-foot radius at its top. Ships and creatures of the brine drake's size or smaller that come into contact with the whirlpool must succeed on a DC 19 check (Swim check for creatures, Profession [sailor] check for ships) or be pulled into the swirling waters and trapped, spinning around the whirlpool and taking 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage initially and 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage for another 1d6 rounds at which point the whirlpool dissipates. A brine dragon is immune to the effects of its own maelstrom. The check DC is Constitution-based.  Savage Bite (Ex) A brine drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a brine drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.  Watery Breath (Su) Once per round, as a standard action, a brine drake can unleash a blast of salt water in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in the area take 7d6 points of bludgeoning damage (DC 19 Reflex half). Once a brine drake has used its watery breath, it cannot use it again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Most creatures die when their heads are cut off. This ability functions as the vorpal weapon special ability.  Hypnotic Display (Su) As a full-round action, a camulatz may cause its coat of feathers to change colors, shifting through a mesmerizing pattern that lures creatures to the camulatz's side. All creatures who can see the camulatz (even other camulatz) must succeed on a DC 18 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same camulatz's hypnotic display for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the hypnotic display moves toward the camulatz using the most direct means available. If this path leads the victim into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim that is within 5 feet of the camulatz simply stands and offers no resistance to the camulatz's attacks. This effect lasts for 1d6 rounds.  Sightless creatures are not affected. This is a mind-affecting pattern effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Sound Mimicry (Ex) A camulatz can perfectly imitate certain sounds or the speech of any creature it has heard, though this ability does not allow it to speak or to understand languages it does not know. The listener must make a Sense Motive check opposed by the camulatz's Bluff check to recognize the mimicry, although if the listener isn't familiar with the person or the type of creatures mimicked, it takes a -8 penalty on its Sense Motive check.  The camulatz has a +8 racial bonus on its Bluff check to mimic speech or sounds that it has listened to for at least 10 minutes. It cannot duplicate the effects of magical abilities (such as bardic performance or a harpy's captivating song), though it may be able to mimic the sound of those abilities.

This deals 2d6+12 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent must make a successful DC 24 Fortitude save or be stunned for one round. A cave giant can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based. Oversized Weapon Use (Ex) A cave giant wields a Gargantuan greatclub without penalty.

Aside from being sinisterly colored, hellfire functions like normal fire, except that half the damage dealt by hellfire is fire damage and the other half results from evil energy and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. In addition, all of a chortov's spell-like abilities with the fire subtype produce hellfire instead of normal fire. Hellfire Soul (Su) Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a chortov explodes in a blast of hellfire. All creatures within 25 feet take 6d6 points of damage from hellfire (see above; DC 22 Reflex save for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon exploding, the chortov's waning yet still raging soul lingers on as a creature of pure living hellfire. This creature has the same statistics as a Huge fire elemental, except that damage caused by its burn ability results from hellfire and it is not vulnerable to cold. Every round that this hellfire elemental exists, it loses 10 hit points until it dissipates completely. Infernal Bondage (Su) Chortovs wage Hell's wars not by choice, but due to powerful magical bondage. The armor that binds all chortovs bears an infernal curse that compels these murderous fiends to serve the will of their infernal masters. This compulsion can be temporarily dismissed by a break enchantment, dispel law, or dispel magic spell that overcomes a DC 25 dispel check. This frees the chortov of its bondage for 1d6 minutes, during which the baffled creature acts as though under the effects of the spell confusion. Destroying the armor via sundering attacks also frees the devil for 1d6 minutes, after which the armor magically reforms. A chortov's armor has hardness 13 and 45 hit points. Wrath (Su) The anger and hatred of chortovs is infectious. Any creature damaged by a weapon wielded by a chortov or a chortov's slam attack must make a DC 17 or be thrown into a haze of murderous rage, being treated as though under the effects of the spells confusion and rage. This mania lasts for 1 minute, but victims may retry their save to resist every round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A chuul-ttaen is considered invisible (+40 Stealth or +20 Stealth when moving) when encountered in the dark by a creature using darkvision. In lit areas, a chuul-ttaen appears as a ghostly white surface-dwelling chuul.  Larvae Spray (Ex) Once per week as a free action, a female chuul-ttaen can release a spray (15-foot cone) of minute barbed larvae. The initial blast deals 1d8 points of damage and injects larvae into the opponent's body. The affected creature must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save to avoid implantation. The save DC is Constitution based. If a chuul-ttaen implants larvae into a paralyzed or otherwise helpless creature, it gets no saving throw. The larvae pupate over the course of 10 days. The host becomes increasing ill suffering a -1 to Strength, Constitution and Dexterity each day of the pupation (-10 maximum) as the pupae absorb nutrients. At the end of the 10 day gestation, 2d4 Diminutive chuul-ttaen burst from the host, killing it in the process. A remove disease or heal spell rids a victim of the larvae/ pupae as does a DC 25 Heal check. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient. The ability score damage heals normally after the larvae/pupae have been removed.  Paralytic Tentacles (Ex) A chuul-ttaen can transfer a grappled victim from a claw to its tentacles as a move action. The tentacles grapple with the same strength as the claw but deal no damage, instead exuding a paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the tentacles must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save each round on the chuul-ttaen‘s turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes1d8+7 points of damage each round from the creature's mandibles.

If the opponent or the coral giant is touching the ground, the coral giant takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the coral giant is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.  Water Stride (Ex) A coral giant suffers no penalties for fighting in or under water (as if affected by a freedom of movement spell).

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. • Any spell with the water descriptor heals a coral golem 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum 10d6). • Transmute rock to mud slows a coral golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds (no save). • Transmute mud to rock increases the golem's bleed damage to 2d6 for 3 rounds. • Soften earth and stone causes a coral golem to lose its damage reduction for 3 rounds.

Whenever the ooze deals Constitution drain in this manner, it heals 10 hit points for each point of Constitution drained. Excess hit points above its normal maximum are gained as temporary hit points. A coven ooze can gain no more than 30 temporary hit points in this manner. If a coven ooze has temporary hit points when it splits, those temporary hit points are divided into its copies.  Hag Eye Ray (Sp) Every 1d4 rounds, each of the hag eyes within a coven ooze can fire a magic ray at a target within 60 feet. Each hag eye emits a different spell effect: bestow curse (DC 17, -6 to Dexterity), confusion (DC 17, 9 rounds), hold person (DC 16, 9 rounds). All of these spell-like abilities function at CL 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based, and include a +8 racial bonus.  Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a coven ooze. Instead, the creature splits into three identical oozes, each with one third of the original ooze's current hit points (round down). Upon splitting, each copy retains a single hag eye within its mass and can continue to use its hag eye ray ability, albeit with only one spell effect. A coven ooze with 10 hit points or fewer, or that doesn't have enough hag eyes to result in each new ooze getting its own eye, cannot be split and instead takes damage normally.																												
Dark Custodian	9.00	6400	Medium	7	16, touch 16, flat-footed 12	91	6	7	0	channel resistance +4, incorporeal		sunlight powerlessness	fly 80 ft. (perfect)	incorporeal touch +13 (1d8 plus energy drain and incorporeal grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	devour, energy drain (1 level, DC 19), silence of the grave	Str 20, Dex 16, Con -, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 15	10	0	14	Tome of Horrors 4	Devour (Su) Any living creature that is pinned by a dark custodian's grapple gains two negative levels per round that the hold is maintained rather than the standard one negative level of its energy drain. Any creature slain by the dark custodian's energy drain is left a steaming, bloody skeleton, all of its soft tissues having been consumed by the undead.  Incorporeal Grab (Su) If a dark custodian hits with an incorporeal touch, it can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. During the course of this grapple, the dark custodian becomes partially corporeal and its opponent becomes partially incorporeal. This has no game effect other than allowing the dark custodian to use its Strength bonus in its CMB. If it wins the grapple, it establishes a hold at which point its opponent becomes completely incorporeal, as well, along with the dark custodian. The dark custodian automatically begins to devour the held opponent each round he is held. The opponent remains incorporeal until he manages to break the grapple at which time he becomes immediately corporeal. If this occurs within a solid object, the opponent is forcefully ejected from the object's nearest surface, and the opponent takes 1d6 points of damage in the process. The dark custodian must then try to hit with its incorporeal touch attack again to try to reestablish the grapple. Once the dark custodian has an opponent pinned, it attempts to drag him away to devour him in peace.  Lifesense (Su) A dark custodian notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch. Walls less than 5 feet thick are no impediment to this ability.  Silence of the Grave (Su) As a standard action a dark custodian can use its silence of the grave ability. This creates a silence effect as the spell in a 20-foot radius for 7 rounds. This silent zone acts as a desecrate spell giving the dark custodian a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws, as well as, imposing a -3 profane penalty on turn checks. Any living creature within the area of affect must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become dazed for 1 round. A new save is allowed each round. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. Because it takes place in an area of silence, it cannot be counteracted by bardic music. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the daze effect of the same dark custodian's silence of the grave for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) Dark custodians are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. A dark custodian caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a single move action or attack action in a round.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a dark custodian at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.																												
Delver	9.00	6400	Huge	7	23, touch 12, flat-footed 19	138	12	8	21				30 ft., burrow 10 ft.	2 slam +16 (2d6+9 plus corrosive slime)		15 ft.	10 ft.	corrosive slime	Str 28, Dex 19, Con 22, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 10	9	12	30	Misfit Monsters	Compression (Ex) A delver's boneless body can squeeze through spaces that would normally exclude anything larger than a Medium creature; it does not need to make Escape Artist checks to pass through such spaces. When it squeezes through a 5-foot opening, its speed is reduced to 5 feet until it passes completely through.  Corrosive Slime (Ex) The delver's skin is covered in an acidic slime that it uses to dissolve stone and defend against enemies. The slime deals 2d6 acid damage to flesh, 4d8 damage to metal, or 8d10 to stone or crystal. If the delver hits with a natural attack or grapple, it automatically adds its slime damage, and the slime continues to deal 2d6 damage per round for the next 2 rounds. Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a delver takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex saving throw. A quart or more of water can wash away the slime. Any weapon that strikes the delver takes slime damage, as does a creature grappling or attacking the delver with natural weapons (both Reflex half DC 22). The saves are Constitution-based.  Sculpt Stone (Ex) A delver can secrete a weaker form of its slime from its tentacles that momentarily softens stone rather than destroying it, allowing the creature to reshape up to 25 cubic feet of stone as if using stone shape as a 15th-level caster. This ability has no effect on stone that is protected against acid. It can use this ability at will.

Scimitar Training (Ex) All desert giants are proficient with scimitars, and can wield them as if they were light weapons.

This mist either deals 10d6 points of cold damage (DC 20 Reflex half ), creates a region of fog in the area that lasts for 1 minute (similar to that created by a fog cloud spell), or creates a blast of severe wind (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439) in the area. The dragon horse may use this breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Flying Charge (Ex) A dragon horse gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls if it charges while flying.  Know Alignment (Su) Dragon horses automatically know the alignment of any creature they can see.  Shift Planes (Su) A dragon horse can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, Plane of Air, or Material Plane once per day as a standard action. This functions as plane shift, but the dragon horse can only bring up to two other willing creatures with it, and only if they are on its back.

Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) A dream spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered. Dreamsense (Su) A dream spectre can automatically pinpoint the presence of dreams within 100 feet. This ability only works against sleeping creatures. Heart-Stopping Fear (Su) By revealing its true form to a living creature, a dream spectre instills heart-stopping fear in its foe. A creature viewing the dream spectre must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer a heart attack and be reduced to 0 hit points. On the next round the creature drops to -1 hit point and is dying. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to the heart-stopping fear attack of that dream spectre for one day. This ability only functions against creatures that are awake. The save DC is Charisma-based. Nightmare (Su) As a full-round action, a dream spectre can touch a sleeping creature and warp and twist its dreams into violent, chaotic nightmares. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be affected as by a nightmare spell. The save DC is Charisma-based. Sleep (Su) As a full-round action, a dream spectre can induce sleep in a single creature it touches with its incorporeal touch attack.

Creatures hitting an acid quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack. Acid Swimmer (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic nature of their environment on their home plane. Drench (Ex) The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals the quasi-elemental's HD). Fumes (Ex) The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body act as an inhaled poison. Creatures within 5 ft. of an acid quasi-elemental must make succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage each round. This poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves more than 5 ft. away from the acid quasi-elemental. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by water. An acid quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasi-elemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental.

A creature caught in the area can make a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics for each elemental's death throes. Molten Glass (Ex) A successful hit against an obsidian quasi-elemental with a piercing or slashing weapon (or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage equal to its current HD opens a wound that spurts molten glass. The wound bleeds for 1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a Reflex save or take fire damage from the splash. A new save must be made each round the wound bleeds and a creature is within the area. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.

Fungus Queen	9.00	6400	Medium	7	23, touch 13, flat-footed 20	114	13	7	7		20		20 ft.	2 claws +14 (1d6+5), 4 tentacles +12 (1d4+2 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	compel plants, constrict (1d4+5), create spawn, energy drain (1 level, DC 23), sporepod	Str 21, Dex 17, Con 21, Int 18, Wis 16, Cha 24	9	+14 (+18 grapple)	27	Inner Sea Bestiary	Compel Plants (Su) A fungus queen's mind-affecting powers and spell-like abilities (and spells, should the fungus queen gain the ability to cast them) affect plant creatures (but not mindless plant creatures) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects.  Create Spawn (Su) A creature that would normally be slain by a fungus queen's energy drain attack is not killed- instead, it immediately loses all negative levels imparted by the fungus queen and transforms into a fungus-infested minion of the queen. Such creatures gain the fungoid simple template. Fungoid creatures are under the control of the fungus creature that created them, and remain enslaved until their mistress is destroyed or until they are cured of the infestation (see the facing page). A fungus queen can communicate telepathically with her fungoid spawn at any range as long as they are on the same plane, and may have a number of Hit Dice worth of enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice her own Hit Dice; any spawn she creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed fungoid creatures. A fungus queen may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a fungoid creature cannot be enslaved again (although it can still be influenced by the fungus queen's compel plants and plant empathy abilities).  Energy Drain (Su) A fungus queen's energy drain functions identically to that of a succubus (Bestiary 68). Creatures killed by this attack do not die-they instead become infested with the fungus queen's spores (see Create Spawn). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Plant Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy, save that a fungus queen can use this ability only on plant creatures. A fungus queen gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Mindless plant creatures are imparted a modicum of implanted intelligence when a fungus queen uses this ability, allowing her to train such creatures as guardians.  Sporepod (Su) As a standard action, a fungus queen can cause a Medium pod of fungal material to burst out of the ground at any point within 60 feet of her current location. Once created, a sporepod cannot move. If the fungus queen travels more than 120 feet from a sporepod, it is destroyed. A fungus queen can maintain a number of sporepods equal to her Charisma modifier (7 for the typical fungus queen). As a move action, she can instantaneously travel to one of her sporepods as if using transport via plants. She can also choose to spread out her tentacle attacks among her sporepods, attacking a creature within 5 feet of any sporepod with a tentacle-she is still limited to making only four tentacle attacks as part of a full-attack action, or one as a standard action. A sporepod is an object that has an AC of 15 and 20 hit points; damage dealt to a sporepod does not harm the fungus queen.

An eel dart deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + the galvo's Strength modifier plus 1d6 points of electricity damage.  Swarmlike (Ex) A galvo has no discernible anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. It is also immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate). Mind-affecting effects that target a single creature function normally against a galvo, since the creature's individual components share a hive mind. A galvo takes half again as much damage (+50%) from damaging area effects such as fireball and splash weapons.  Varied Attack (Ex) A galvo's slam attack deals both bludgeoning and slashing damage since the creature is formed completely of biting eels.

Spells Garudas cast spells as 7th-level sorcerers.  Swooping Pounce (Ex) When a garuda makes a diving aerial charge, it can make a full attack with its natural weapons.  Talon or Wing (Ex) A garuda cannot use its wing attacks while flying, and cannot use its talon attacks while not flying.

When a geist enters a haunt's area of effect, the geist can immediately attempt to take over the haunt by making a Charisma check. If the result of the Charisma check is equal to or greater than the haunt's CR, the geist takes over the haunt and maintains control as long as the geist remains within 1 mile. If the geist's attempt to take control of a haunt fails, the geist must retreat from the haunt's area of effect and cannot attempt to take control of the haunt again for 24 hours. When a geist controls a haunt, it can activate or suppress the haunt's effects as a free action and the haunt automatically resets in half its normal time. A haunt under a geist's control can still be neutralized when reduced to 0 hit points, but it cannot be permanently put to rest until the geist that controls it is destroyed. A geist can control a number of haunts up to its Charisma modifier at one time (usually five).   Terrifying Laugh (Su) Once per minute, a geist can unleash a terrifying laugh as a standard action. The laughter lasts until the beginning of the geist's next turn. All creatures within 30 feet of the geist when it begins to laugh, as well as all creatures that end their turn within that radius, must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be panicked. The save is required only once per laugh. Those who succeed at their saving throws need not save against the same geist's terrifying laughter for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Boulders move at a speed of 10 feet and fight as a geon in all respects.  Animated boulders lose their ability to move if the geon that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 15th), but affects rocks rather than trees. Animated boulders have the same vulnerability to cold that a geon has.

A creature that catches on fire cannot extinguish the flames until it first escapes the grapple.  Change Shape (Su) A ghirru can assume the shape of a Large flame-spawned dire wolf. A flame-spawned dire wolf is an 8 HD dire wolf with the following abilities: immunity to fire, vulnerability to cold, deals 1d6 points of fire damage with its bite attack.  Genie-kin (Ex) For all race-related effects (such as a ranger's favored enemy), a ghirru is considered a genie even though its type is undead.

The save DC is Constitution-based. Spines-contact or injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Wis and confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. Poison Spray (Ex) As a standard action, once every 5 rounds, a spear urchin can spray poison from numerous smaller spines across its body. This poison fills a 20-foot-radius spread around the urchin- all creatures within this area are exposed to the urchin's venom and must make Fortitude saves as detailed above to resist Wisdom damage and confusion. This attack is even more effective underwater, as the poison spray creates a cloud that lingers in the area around the urchin for 5 rounds-creatures must save each round they begin a turn in the area of the poison cloud in addition to when the urchin creates the effect. Spines (Ex) A glass urchin's spines can swivel and rotate to face any approaching creature that attacks it. Any creature that attacks a glass urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack, or any Huge or smaller creature that attacks with a one-handed weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the glass urchin's spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can poison the target as well. Transparency (Ex) A glass urchin's spines and body are transparent when underwater, granting the creature concealment and a constant 20% miss chance.

Dragon A gorgimera's dragon head breath weapon depends on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a gorgimera's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 21 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. To determine a gorgimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below. 1d10 Head Color Breath Weapon 1-2 Black 40-foot line of acid 3-4 Blue 40-foot line of lightning 5-6 Green 20-foot cone of gas (acid) 7-8 Red 20-foot cone of fire 9-10 White 20-foot cone of cold Gorgon A gorgimera's gorgon head breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds (no more than twice per day), turns a creature to stone permanently, and allows a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid. The save DC is Constitution-based. The breath weapon is a 30-foot cone.

If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Earth Mastery (Ex) An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.

Creatures attacking a greater gelid beetle unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.  Cold Cloud (Ex) Once per minute as a free action, a greater gelid beetle can emit a cloud of thick, billowing, icy cold vapors in a 20-foot radius around its body. The cloud is extremely thick and prevents effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays). Melee attack and damage rolls suffer a -2 penalty in the cloud. Each round, on the beetle's turn, the cloud deals 2d6 points of cold damage to each creature within it. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.  The cloud lasts 1d4+3 rounds before dispersing.																												
Greater Gravity Elemental	9.00	6400	Huge	13	20, touch 20, flat-footed 10	136	9	16	8	distortion			fly 100 ft.

Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds.

Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A control water spell cast on an area containing a burrowing ice elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the elemental climbs must be icy. The elemental can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Numbing Cold (Su) When an ice elemental deals cold damage to a creature, that creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is listed in the elemental's stat block and is Constitution-based. Snow Vision (Ex) An ice elemental can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.  Lava Puddle (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a puddle of lava (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) that fills its space to a depth of 2-3 inches and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round. The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after a number of rounds equal to the elemental's Hit Dice. At the GM's discretion, this puddle of lava could start secondary fires.

It cannot use this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Entrap (Ex) The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3 rounds of immersion in water.

Burn (Ex) A smoke elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn as hot as a true fire elemental's flames.  Engulf (Ex) A smoke elemental can engulf creatures of its size or smaller into its smoky form as part of a standard action. It cannot make any other attack in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that are not adjacent to them.  Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Gaseous (Ex) A smoke elemental can pass through small holes or narrow openings without reducing its speed.  Vulnerability to Wind (Ex) A smoke elemental is treated as two sizes smaller for purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.																												
Greater Water Elemental	9.00	6400	Huge	5	23, touch 14, flat-footed 17	123	12	15	4				20 ft., swim 90 ft.	2 slams +20 (2d8+9)		15 ft.	15 ft.	drench, vortex (DC 25), water mastery	Str 28, Dex 20, Con 19, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 11	13	24	40	PFRPG Bestiary	Drench (Ex) The elemental's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental's HD). Vortex (Su) A water elemental can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (see page 306), but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water. Water Mastery (Ex) A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.																												
High Cimota	9.00	6400	Medium	8	21, touch 14, flat-footed 17	141	10	10	12	channel resistance +4, displacement, undead traits, unholy existence	17		fly 60 ft. (good)	2 scimitars +15 (1d6+4 plus 1d6 electrical/15-20, evil-aligned)		5 ft.	5 ft.	dark fury, manifestation, superior two-weapon fighting	Str 18, Dex 18, Con -, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 22	10	14	28	Tome of Horrors 4	Dark Fury (Su) As a free action a high cimota may generate a field of negative energy in the form of black lightning. A high cimota may use this power at the start of combat and every 1d3 rounds thereafter. This field of energy may take the form of black lightning either in a 20 ft. radius ball around the high cimota or as a 100 foot line extending from the high cimota's invisible fingertips. Dark fury inflicts 6d6 negative energy damage on any living creature in its area of effect unless it succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. This save is charisma based. Undead, constructs and other non-living objects are not affected by dark fury.  Displacement (Su) Cimota manifest on the Prime Material Plane as a shifting cloud of shadows that coalesce into their cloaked and hooded forms. On any round that a cimota first manifests (see below), its shifting forms affect it as a displacement spell. Attacks on a cimota at this time have a 50% miss chance as if the cimota had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, this displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting a cimota normally. This effect is canceled one round after a cimota manifests, or if a cimota takes any action in its new locale.  Manifestation (Su) As a standard action, a cimota can transport itself via planar travel from any point on the Prime Material Plane to another point within its defined area, or within 300 feet of the artifact to which it is bound. A cimota may also lurk on the Negative Material Plane, prepared to manifest on the Prime Material if certain conditions are met, such as trespassers entering the area they are doomed to guard. A cimota cannot attack or move in the same round in which it manifests, although it may manifest as partial surprise action before initiative. A cimota benefits from displacement (see above) on the round in which it first manifests.  Lifesense (Su) A cimota notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex) A black skeleton usually fights with a short sword in each hand. Because of its magical nature, its Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with both weapons at no penalty.  Unholy Existence (Su) Although it is possible to temporarily destroy a cimota's physical form, it will return in 1d6 days, manifesting again to continue its unholy existence. The only way to permanently destroy a cimota is to disrupt its existence by consecrating the ground to which it is tied or the destruction of the artifact to which it is bound. Sometimes, significant alteration of an unholy place, such as demolition of an evil temple or burning a haunted forest, could cause cimota to fade away permanently. Although their physical forms may be damaged by normal attacks, their unholy existence grants them spell resistance 17. Because cimota exist partially on the Negative Material Plane they are subject to banishment or other spells that affect outsiders.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a cimota unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. This aura takes effect when a cimota manifests on the Prime Material Plane. Animals that come within 30 feet of a place where cimota are lurking on the Negative Material Plane, or an artifact to which a cimota is bound; Will be uneasy and show signs of disquiet.																												
Ijiraq	9.00	6400	Medium	2	25, touch 13, flat-footed 22	105	8	13	13				30 ft.	2 claws +10 (2d4+3), bite +10 (2d6+3), gore +10 (2d6+3)	javelin +9 (1d6+3)	5 ft.	5 ft.	disorienting gaze	Str 16, Dex 15, Con 18, Int 15, Wis 19, Cha 22	7	10	23	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Disorienting Gaze (Su) An ijiraq can level an icy stare at a creature within 30 feet. That creature takes a -20 penalty on Perception checks and Survival checks for 24 hours (Fortitude DC 23 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based. An ijiraq can use this ability while in the shape of an elk.  Hide in Plain Sight (Su) An ijiraq can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as it's standing in terrain covered in ice or snow, an ijiraq can hide itself from view in the open without actually hiding behind anything. An ijiraq can't use this ability while flying, and the ability has no effect when the ijiraq isn't in icy terrain.																												
Irnakurse	9.00	6400	Large	7	23, touch 12, flat-footed 20	105	9	8	9				10 ft.	bite +8 14 (1d8+7), 4 tentacles +8 (1d6+3 plus mind lash)		10 ft.	10 ft. (15 ft. with tentacles)	soul scream, rend (2 tentacles 2d6+10; 3 tentacles 3d6+10; 4 tentacles 4d6+10)	Str 24, Dex 17, Con 23, Int 8, Wis 14, Cha 18	7	15	28 (32 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Mind Lash (Su) Those struck by an irnakurse are overwhelmed with dark emotions and corrupted images of a ruined life. Any non-evil creature hit by an irnakurse's tentacle must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be stunned for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves can't be affected by the same irnakurse's mind lash for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Soul Scream (Su) Capable of channeling all of its rage and terror into a single, unnatural noise, an irnakurse can unleash a sound of alien horror as a standard action. Any non-evil creature within 30 feet of a screaming irnakurse must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain. Once it begins screaming, an irnakurse can continue as a free action for 6 rounds, but can't scream again for 5 minutes afterward. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Iron Maiden Golem	9.00	6400	Large	0	25, touch 9, flat-footed 25	96	4	4	4			vulnerability to rust	20 ft.	2 slams +19 (2d10+8 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	animated host, bladed lid, steal essence	Str 27, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	12	+21 (+25 grapple)	31	Tome of Horrors Complete	Animated Host (Su) Once a victim trapped within an iron maiden has died, it reanimates as a zombie in the next round (as if by an animate dead spell). It cannot escape, however, and serves only to fuel the iron maiden and provide it with skills and abilities. While it is trapped, the zombie cannot be attacked, damaged, turned, rebuked, or commanded, and it doesn't suffer any damage from the bladed lid. If the lid of the golem is somehow forced open, the zombie has the normal abilities of a Medium zombie (as detailed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). The victim of an iron maiden golem must be alive when it is placed inside and the lid is closed or the golem's animate host ability fails. Bladed Lid (Ex) A living creature inside an iron maiden when the lid is closed is pierced by twenty dagger-like blades, dealing a total of 50 points of piercing damage each round. The lid automatically seals with an arcane lock spell with a caster level equal to that of the iron maiden golem's creator (14th level usually). The lid can be forced open with a successful Strength check (DC 34) or by casting dispel magic. The knock spell has no effect on the lid. The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +10 bonus from the arcane lock spell. Because of the shape of the iron maiden, only a Medium humanoid can be sealed inside. Immunity to Magic (Ex) An iron maiden golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron maiden golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the iron maiden golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. Steal Essence (Su) An iron maiden golem that has created a host using its animate host ability (see above) gains 10 temporary hit points, uses its own base attack bonus or the host's (whichever is higher), and can make normal use of the victim's skills, feats, and non-magical class abilities. The golem must substitute its own ability scores when determining its total skill bonuses; therefore it cannot use skills requiring Constitution or Intelligence, and since it cannot speak, many Charisma skills are severely limited. Likewise, the iron maiden golem must meet the requirements for any feat in order to make use of that feat (thus feats such as Dodge and Combat Expertise are unavailable to the golem). An iron maiden cannot use any divine spells or divinely granted special abilities, since the host within is no longer able to receive such abilities from her deity. An iron maiden likewise cannot use any arcane spells as its inherent magic immunity disrupts any attempt to do so. Vulnerability to Rust (Ex) An iron maiden golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.																												
Juvenile Copper Dragon	9.00	6400	Medium	6	25, touch 12, flat-footed 23	115	11	9	10	uncanny dodge			40 ft., fly 150 ft.

Slow Breath (Su) Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.  Trap Master(Ex) A juvenile or older copper dragon receives a +1 bonus per age category on Craft (traps) and Perception checks made to locate a trap. Upon becoming a mature adult, he can also use Disable Device to disarm magic traps as if he had the rogue's Trapfinding class feature.																												
Juvenile Green Dragon	9.00	6400	Large	1	23, touch 10, flat-footed 22	115	11	8	11				40 ft., fly 200 ft.

Woodland Stride (Ex) A very young or older green dragon can move through any sort of foliage at full speed without taking damage or suffering impairment. Areas of foliage that have been magically manipulated affect it normally.																												
Jyoti	9.00	6400	Medium	5	24, touch 16, flat-footed 18	104	11	8	11	divine aversion, positive energy affinity	20		30 ft., fly 90 ft. (good)	#ERROR!	ray +16 ranged touch (by spell)	5 ft.	5 ft.	breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 11d6 fire, Reflex DC 19 half, usable once every 1d4 rounds), positive energy	Str 14, Dex 20, Con 19, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 15	11	13	29	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Breath Weapon (Su) A jyoti's breath weapon is a focused burst of searing fire infused with positive energy. Undead in the area take 11d8 damage rather than 11d6.  Divine Aversion (Su) Jyoti dislike deities and are never divine spellcasters. Jyoti gain a +2 racial bonus on saves against divine magical effects.  Positive Energy (Su) A jyoti's natural weapons and any weapons it wields strike as if they were ghost touch weapons. In addition, any weapon (natural or manufactured) a jyoti uses deals +1d6 fire damage on a hit.  Positive Energy Affinity (Ex) A jyoti can exist comfortably on the Positive Energy Plane, and does not benefit (or suffer) from that plane's overwhelming infusions of life-giving energies. Whenever a jyoti is subjected to a magical healing effect, that effect functions at its full potential, as if enhanced by Maximize Spell.																												
Kithangian	9.00	6400	Large	4	25, touch 9, flat-footed 25	115	12	9	7		20		50 ft.	2 claws +16 (1d6+6/19-20 plus grab), 2 stings +16 (1d6+6/19-20 plus poison)		10 ft.	10 ft.	hatred, rasping tongues	Str 22, Dex 11, Con 20, Int 7, Wis 19, Cha 16	11	+18 (+22 grapple)	28	The Worldwound	Hatred (Ex) A kithangian gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made against all creatures of the animal type. In addition, animals take a -2 penalty on all saving throws against a kithangian's supernatural or spell-like abilities.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str plus nauseated; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Rasping Tongues (Su) The faces between a kithangian's claws have long rasping tongues covered with tiny teeth. Whenever a kithangian successfully grapples a foe with its claws, a rasping tongue slithers out from the face within and burrows into the creature's body. Each round that the creature is grappled, it takes 1d6 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage as its sense of self-identity is warped and twisted. A successful DC 18 Will save negates the Charisma damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Swift Transformation (Su) A kithangian can use its change shape ability as a swift action.																												
Kytha	9.00	6400	Medium	7	23, touch 13, flat-footed 20	112	12	6	8		20		40 ft.	2 claws +16 (1d6+7), bite +16 (1d8+10/19-20), tongue +16 (1d6+7 plus poison)		5 ft.	5 ft.

Large Lightning Quasi-elemental	9.00	6400	Large	12	22, touch 18, flat-footed 13	102	7	16	8			vulnerability to water	fly 60 ft. (perfect)	2 slams +19 (2d6 electricity)		10 ft.	10 ft.	electricity	Str 14, Dex 26, Con 16, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11	12	15	34	Tome of Horrors Complete	Electricity (Ex) A lightning quasi-elemental is composed entirely of electricity and deals electricity damage each time it hits. A creature striking the lightning quasi-elemental unarmed, or a creature striking the lightning quasi-elemental with a weapon take this same electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. Metallic creatures or creatures using metal weapons take an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. Globe (Ex) As a standard action, a lightning quasi-elemental can discharge one globe of electricity per HD it possesses once per round. Globes hover by the quasi-elemental and move with the creature. An opponent that moves within 5 feet of a lightning quasi-elemental discharges a globe and takes the electricity damage shown on the table below. An affected creature can make a Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. Once a globe discharges, it is destroyed and a lightning quasi-elemental cannot recreate it for 4 hours. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A lightning quasi-elemental takes 1d8 points of damage per gallon of water it contacts. Pouring water onto a lightning quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level to a lightning quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against a lightning quasi-elemental.																												
Lava Drake	9.00	6400	Large	7	22, touch 12, flat-footed 19	115	11	10	8			vulnerable to cold	20 ft., burrow (lava only) 30 ft., fly 60 ft. (average)	bite +17 (1d8+7), 2 claws +17 (1d6+7), tail slap +15 (1d8+3)		10 ft.	10 ft.	magma shake, pyroclastic vomit	Str 25, Dex 16, Con 18, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 11	11	+19 (+21 bull rush)	32 (34 vs. bull rush)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Magma Shake (Ex) Whenever a lava drake exits from being submerged in molten rock (either magma or lava), on the next round as a full-round action, it can shake its body, flicking a fine spray of scalding molten rock in every direction. All creatures within a 30-foot radius of the lava drake take 5d6 points of fire damage from the shower of scalding rock; a successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. Performing a magma shake clears the drake's scales of all excess molten rock and it must resubmerge itself in order to use this attack again. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Pyroclastic Vomit (Ex) As a standard action, a lava drake can vomit forth a ball of molten rock that explodes upon striking a target, showering the target and adjacent creatures in magma. This attack has a range of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 19 half) to the primary target and 3d6 points of fire damage to any creatures within 20 feet of the primary target. The magma continues to burn for 1d3 rounds, dealing an additional 3d6 points of fire damage per round to the primary target and 1d6 points of fire damage per round to any secondary targets. After the magma cools, it crumbles to dust. Once a lava drake has used its pyroclastic vomit, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a lava drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an addition move action that round.																												
Lava Lurker	9.00	6400	Medium	5	22, touch 11, flat-footed 21	114	12	9	4			vulnerable to cold, vulnerable to water	30 ft., swim 30 ft.

All creatures within a 5-foot-radius burst take 8d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 20 half). In addition to the damage, every affected square is targeted by quench (CL 10th). This also targets all fire effects and magic items that create and control flame.  If the lava lurker is killed in a pool of magma, it solidifies the rock within the area of effect, though in an active magma flow or similar natural and nearly endless s Vulnerable to Water (Ex) If a significant amount of water- such as the contents of a large bucket, the liquid created by a create water spell, or a blow from a water elemental- strikes a lava lurker, the lava lurker must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be staggered for 2d4 rounds. A lava lurker that is immersed in water is automatically staggered and must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save each round or be petrified (this DC increases by 1 on each subsequent round), reverting to its molten stone form once the water is gone.																												
Leanan Sidhe	9.00	6400	Medium	#ERROR!	25, touch 19, flat-footed 21	100	12	15	13				30 ft., fly 30 ft. (good)	dagger +5 (1d4/19-20) or touch +5 (1d4 Cha damage)		5 ft.	5 ft.	life drain, mythic power (3/day, surge +1d6)	Str 10, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 13, Wis 12, Cha 21	5	5	24	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Life Drain (Ex) A leanan sidhe immediately knows if a creature uses her skill blessing or spell blessing. As a standard action at any range, she can expend one use of mythic power to drain 1 point of Constitution from that creature. The leanan sidhe heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to her full normal hit points) each time she uses this ability.  Skill Blessing (Su) As a standard action, a leanan sidhe can create a special token that takes the form of a masterwork artisan's tool for one Craft or Perform skill. The intended recipient of this tool gains a +4 bonus on skill checks made with the token. Like with a cursed item, the recipient prefers to use the token, refuses to get rid of it, and finds that it returns if stolen or discarded. The leanan sidhe can destroy the token as a standard action at any range. She can have a number of tokens in existence equal to her mythic rank.  Spell Blessing (Su) A leanan sidhe may enhance the magic of a willing humanoid spellcaster by touching him for 1 full round. The blessing allows the target to recall a number of spell levels each day equal to twice the leanan sidhe's mythic rank. This recalling works like a pearl of power, except it works for spellcasters of any class (spontaneous casters recover spent spell slots). The leanan sidhe can end this blessing as a standard action at any range. The number of blessed creatures she can have at the same time is equal to her mythic rank.  Unearthly Grace (Su) A leanan sidhe adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws and as a deflection bonus to her AC.																												
Leukodaemon	9.00	6400	Large	11	23, touch 16, flat-footed 16	115	9	14	12		20		30 ft., fly 60 ft. (average)	bite +16 (1d8+7), 2 claws +16 (1d6+7)	#ERROR!	10 ft.	10 ft.	breath of flies	Str 25, Dex 24, Con 23, Int 16, Wis 21, Cha 16	10	18	35	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Breath of Flies (Su) Once per minute as a standard action, a leukodaemon can unleash a cloud of corpse-bloated, biting black flies in a 20-foot cone. Those caught in the cone take 8d6 points of slashing damage. A DC 21 Reflex save halves this damage. Those who take any damage are also sickened for 1 minute. In addition, the flies linger for 1d4+1 rounds, congealing into a buzzing 20-foot-square cloud centered on the cone's original point of origin. Any creature that ends its turn in this cloud must make a DC 21 Reflex save to avoid taking 4d6 points of damage and becoming sickened for 1 minute. This cloud of flies may be dispersed by any area effect that does damage or creates wind of at least strong wind force. All daemons are immune to this effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Contagion (Su) Any arrow a leukodaemon fires from a bow is tainted with disease. If a creature is damaged by a leukodaemon's arrow, it must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or be affected as if by the spell contagion. A leukodaemon can manifest arrows at will and never runs out of ammunition.  Infectious Aura (Su) All creatures within 50 feet of a leukodaemon take a -4 penalty on Fortitude saves against disease effects.																												
Lich Shade	9.00	6400	Medium	8	20, touch 15, flat-footed 15	104	10	9	12	channel resistance +2	20		30 ft.	2 claws +15 (1d6+7 plus 1d6 cold)		5 ft.	5 ft.	chill, death throes, spell leech	Str 24, Dex 19, Con -, Int 19, Wis 16, Cha 20	8	15	30	Tome of Horrors Complete	Chill (Su) A lich shade's claws inflict an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on a hit, and any creature that takes this additional cold damage must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by the numbing chill. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Death Throes (Su) When a lich shade is destroyed, it explodes into a burst of choking dust. All creatures within 10 feet must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage from the violent choking and necromantic scouring of this supernaturally vile dust. Those who fail the save are also nauseated for 1d6 rounds, while those who succeed are merely sickened for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Spell Leech (Su) Whenever a spellcaster within 50 feet of a lich shade casts a spell, the spellcaster must make a DC 20 Will save or the spell is lost, as if it were counterspelled. The lost spell's energy is transferred to the lich shade, who can use the magical energy in one of the following three ways.  A lich shade can only store the energy of one spell at a time.  Cast: A lich shade can cast the spell on his turn at caster level 11th. When casting spells in this manner, he ignores the spell's material component requirements, but not its focus requirements.  Eldritch Bolt: A lich shade can release the spell as an eldritch bolt of pure magic energy as a standard action (range 50 ft., ranged touch +12, 1d6 damage per 2 levels of the spell used to create it).  Healing: A lich shade can absorb the spell's energy to heal hit points equal to the spell's level x4. Hit points in excess of his maximum are instead gained as temporary hit points.  These temporary hit points last for 1 hour before fading.  Spell Sense (Su) A lich shade can automatically pinpoint the location of any spellcaster within 100 feet who has cast a spell within the previous round.

(perfect)	touch +5 (3d6 plus desiccation)		20 ft.	20 ft.	consuming mirage (DC 21, 3d6 plus desiccation), natural invisibility, project mirage (DC 18)	Str -, Dex 10, Con 20, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 10	9	13	23	Osirion, Legacy Of Pharaohs	Consuming Mirage (Ex) A living mirage can engulf foes, as the universal monster ability. A creature engulfed by a living mirage doesn't gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating-but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, the victim is subject to the living mirage's desiccation attack in addition to the damage this ability causes. The save DC to avoid a living mirage's consuming mirage ability is Constitution-based.  Desiccation (Ex) A living mirage siphons streamers of blood and other vital fluids away from living creatures it touches or engulfs. A living creature that takes damage from the living mirage must succeed at a Constitution check to avoid the effects of thirst (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444), using the amount of damage dealt by the living mirage as the check's DC. A creature that is already suffering the effects of thirst must attempt another Constitution check (DC equal to the damage dealt by the living mirage or the DC against thirst as if 1 hour had passed since the target creature's last check, whichever is higher) or take nonlethal damage from their thirst as described in the Core Rulebook. The target takes a cumulative -1 penalty on this check for each consecutive round beyond the first it takes damage from the living mirage. A creature that takes nonlethal damage from thirst as a result of this ability is fatigued.  Gaseous (Ex) A living mirage has a body composed of shimmering air. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects as a result.  Natural Invisibility (Ex) A living mirage remains invisible at all times, even when attacking. This ability isn't subject to the invisibility purge spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint it, a living mirage gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving or a +40 bonus when standing still. These bonuses are not included in the statistics above. Because of its size and pervasiveness within the area it occupies, a living mirage gains only a 20% miss chance due to its invisibility.  Project Mirage (Ex) As a standard action, a living mirage can create an illusory vision in areas of extreme heat or reflection-such as a desert, open ocean, or snow plain-to lure victims toward it. This is a nonmagical mind-affecting glamer effect identical to hallucinatory terrain. The living mirage can dismiss this effect as a swift action. The save DC to disbelieve the illusion is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Vulnerable to Wind (Ex) A living mirage is treated as a Small creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it (Core Rulebook 439).

Regardless of its type, a mantidrake's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 5d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 19 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. To determine a mantidrake's draconic parent and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below. 1d10 Draconic Parent Breath Weapon 1-2 Black 60-foot line of acid 3-4 Blue 60-foot line of lightning 5-6 Green 30-foot cone of gas (acid) 7-8 Red 30-foot cone of fire 9-10 White 30-foot cone of cold Spikes (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a mantidrake can loose a volley of six spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only twenty-four spikes in a single day. Immunity to Energy (Ex) A mantidrake is immune to one type of energy based on its draconic heritage: black, immunity to acid; blue, immunity to electricity; green, immunity to acid; red, immunity to fire; white, immunity to cold.

If the opponent or the marid is touching the ground, the marid takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Water's Fury (Su) As a standard action, a marid can release a jet of water in a 60-foot line that deals 1d6 points of damage and blinds the target struck for 1d6 rounds. A DC 20 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the blinding effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Vortex (Su) A marid can transform into a vortex of swirling, churning water once every 10 mintues. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind ability (see page 306 for full details on this special attack), save that it can only be used while the marid is underwater; a marid cannot leave a body of water while in vortex form.																												
Marid Genie	9.00	6400	Large	8	23, touch 14, flat-footed 18	114	10	12	10				20 ft., swim 60 ft.	2 slams +17 (2d6+6) or masterwork trident +18/+13/+8 (2d6+9)		10 ft.	10 ft.	vortex (1/10 minutes, 10-50 ft. tall, 1d8+4 damage, DC 22), water mastery, water's fury	Str 23, Dex 19, Con 18, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 16	12	19	34	Tome of Horrors Complete	Water Mastery (Ex) A marid gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water.

A DC 20 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the blinding effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Vortex (Su) A marid can transform into a vortex of swirling, churning water once every 10 minutes. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind ability, save that it can only be used while the marid is underwater; a marid cannot leave a body of water while in vortex form.

Any creature in the burst's area must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Other mokele-mbembe are immune to this effect.																												
Moon Dog	9.00	6400	Medium	6	22, touch 12, flat-footed 20	65	8	8	8		16		50 ft., 30 ft. on 2 legs	bite +14 (1d8+4 plus trip)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bay, shadow weave	Str 18, Dex 15, Con 15, Int 15, Wis 16, Cha 14	9	13	25 (29 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Bay (Su) A moon dog can produce one of the following effects when it howls or barks. Each effect functions as the spell of the same name (caster level 12th). The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Fear: All evil creatures within 80 feet must make a successful Will save or be affected as by a fear spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by the fear effect of that moon dog's bay for 24 hours.  Dispel Evil: This effect works like the spell, and affects one evil extraplanar creature within 80 feet.  Dismissal: This effect works as the spell, except that it targets one evil extraplanar creature.  Keen Senses (Ex) Moon dogs can see twice as far as humans in low-light and normal light conditions.  Lick (Su) By licking a target, a moon dog may use one of the following abilities: cure light wounds, delay poison, remove disease. Each is usable at will by the moon dog, but only once per day per recipient. Each is caster level 12th.  Plane Shift (Su) A moon dog can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, or Material Plane. This ability resembles the spell of the same name (caster level 12th).  Shadow Weave (Su) When in shadows, a moon dog can move in such a way as to affect evil creatures within 60 feet as though by hypnotic pattern (DC 16 Will save, caster level 12th). Any good-aligned creature in the area of the shadow weave will be affected as though by protection from evil (caster level 12th). The shadow weave is a full-round action, and the moon dog must concentrate to maintain it.

Mythic Aboleth	9.00	6400	Huge	#ERROR!	23, touch 9, flat-footed 22	118	9	6	11				10 ft., swim 60 ft.	4 tentacles +11 (1d8+5 plus slime)		15 ft.	15 ft.	mucus mist, mythic power (3/day, surge +1d6)	Str 20, Dex 12, Con 22, Int 15, Wis 17, Cha 19	6	13	24	Mythic Adventures	Mucus Cloud (Ex) While underwater, an aboleth exudes a cloud of transparent slime. All creatures adjacent to an aboleth must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 3 hours. Renewed contact with an aboleth's mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Mucus Mist (Ex) When exposed to the air, a mythic aboleth can release its mucus as a fine mist. This obscures vision like obscuring mist and has the same properties as its mucus cloud. Creatures that breathe water are able to breathe normally while within the cloud. The mist moves with the aboleth.  Slime (Ex) A creature hit by an aboleth's tentacle must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the transformation persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Slime Armor (Ex) A mythic aboleth can spend 1 minute to create an armorlike carapace from hardened slime. This gives it a +4 armor bonus, reduces its swim speed to 30 feet, and increases its land speed to 30 feet. The aboleth can dissolve the armor as a full-round action.																												
Mythic Flesh Golem	9.00	6400	Large	-1	23, touch 8, flat-footed 23	145	3	2	3				30 ft.	2 slams +16 (2d8+6 plus 1d10 electricity plus sparking slams)		10 ft.	10 ft.	berserk, greater rage (10 rounds/day), mythic brawler, mythic power (3/day, surge +1d6)	Str 22, Dex 9, Con -, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 1	10	17	26	Mythic Adventures	Berserk (Ex) When a mythic flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that the golem goes berserk. A berserk golem attacks the nearest living creature or smashes some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moves on to spread more destruction. If the golem's creator is within 60 feet and succeeds at a DC 20 Charisma check, she regains control of the golem by speaking firmly and persuasively to it. If the golem is inactive for 1 minute, its berserk chance resets to 0%.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A mythic flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A mythic magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a mythic flesh golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save).  • A magical attack that deals electricity damage (other than the golem's own sparking slam) ends any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal; (the golem gets no save against these attacks). If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.  Mythic Brawler (Ex) The mythic flesh golem can spend a use of its mythic power to attempt a combat maneuver as a swift action with no attack of opportunity for the attempt.  Sparking Slams (Su) If a mythic flesh golem strikes an opponent twice in 1 round with its slams, that creature takes an additional 2d10 points of electricity damage. A flesh golem cannot use its electricity attacks to deal electricity damage to itself.																												
Mythic Hill Giant	9.00	6400	Large	-1	24, touch 8, flat-footed 24	119	12	2	3	dense mind, rock catching			30 ft.

It rerolls for each ongoing mind-affecting effect each turn.  Earth Bond (Ex) A mythic hill giant gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saves while touching the ground (including a stone or earthen floor in a building). As a standard action, a hill giant touching the ground can expend one use of mythic power to rejuvenate itself, gaining the benefits of cure critical wounds and restoration.  Ground Pound (Ex) As a standard action, a mythic hill giant can expend one use of mythic power and hit the ground with a bludgeoning weapon. Choose one intersection within reach; creatures touching the ground within a 20-foot burst centered on that intersection take double the damage normally dealt by that bludgeoning weapon (Reflex DC 23 for half). Creatures that fail their saves are knocked prone and moved 5 feet directly away from chosen intersection. This ability has no effect on creatures with the earth bond ability. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Mythic Hydra	9.00	6400	Huge	#ERROR!	20, touch 9, flat-footed 19	117	10	8	4				40 ft., swim 40 ft.	7 bites +8 (1d8+3 plus bleed)		15 ft.	15 ft.	bleed (1), mythic power (3/day, surge +1d6), pounce, push (bite, 10 ft.)	Str 17, Dex 12, Con 20, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 9	7	12	23 (can't be tripped)	Mythic Adventures	Fast Healing (Ex) A mythic hydra's fast healing ability is equal to its current number of heads (minimum fast healing 5). This fast healing applies only to damage dealt to the hydra's body.  Hydra Traits (Ex) A mythic hydra can be killed by severing all of its heads or slaying its body. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra's Hit Dice. To sever a head, an opponent must deal enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or fewer. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra's body equal to the hydra's current Hit Dice. A hydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties.  Regenerate Head (Ex) When a mythic hydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A mythic hydra can't have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A hydra doesn't die from losing heads until all its heads are cut off and the stumps are seared by acid or fire.																												
Mythic Juvenile White Dragon	9.00	6400	Medium	6	26, touch 12, flat-footed 24	124	10	8	7	dragon blood (1d4 cold)		vulnerable to fire	60 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 150 ft.

This ability functions as stone shape, but only targets ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.  Ice Slick (Ex) Ice and slush persists from a mythic juvenile white dragon's breath weapon, coating all surfaces in the area and turning the area into difficult terrain for 1 minute per age category. The dragon can breathe at a location beyond its breath weapon range, coating it in ice and slush, instead of damaging creatures, in a radius equal to half its breath weapon range and at a range of 30 feet per age category (a 15-foot burst up to 120 feet for a mythic juvenile white dragon).  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Power Slide (Ex) If a mythic juvenile white dragon deals trample damage to one or more opponents on ice, snow, frozen tundra, or a similar slippery surface, it can expend one use of mythic power to attempt an awesome blow combat maneuver against each damaged target, as if it had the Awesome Blow monster feat (Bestiary 314).  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Snake bite; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison Weapons (Ex) A mythic medusa can spend a standard action to apply her snake poison to her sword or to two arrows, and normally poisons her weapons in advance.  Summon Snake (Sp) As a full-round action, a mythic medusa can summon an emperor cobra (Bestiary 2 252) or 1d3 amphisbaenas (Bestiary 2 25) as if using a summon monster spell. The summoned snakes are immune to the medusa's gaze attack and remain for 8 rounds before disappearing.  Unpetrify (Su) A mythic medusa can expend one use of mythic power to return a petrified creature to life (as if using stone to flesh) for 1 minute. The creature is under the medusa's control (as if using dominate monster) and reverts to a statue at the end of this time. If the medusa expends three uses of mythic power, the creature remains unpetrified for 24 hours instead of 1 minute. A typical petrified victim in a mythic medusa's lair is a half-elf fighter 6 (Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex 82) or human warrior 6 (NPC Codex 268).

This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. A nependis that succeeds at a second grapple check against the opponent can move up to its full speed as a swift action instead of up to half its speed.  Roar (Su) A nependis can let out a savage roar. Nependises within 60 feet gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and weapon damage rolls for 1d4 rounds. All other creatures other within range of the roar become shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 14 negates); this is a mind-affecting sonic fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Dream Haunting (Su) A night hag can visit the dreams of chaotic or evil targets by using a special periapt known as a heartstone to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once it does so, it rides on the victim's back until dawn. The sleeper suffers tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal intrusions by confronting and defeating the night hag.  Heartstone (Su) All night hags carry a heartstone-a special gemstone worth at least 1,800 gp that is worn as a periapt.  A heartstone's magic is fueled by the hag's spirit and proximity-once separated from its owner (or upon the hag's death), a heartstone retains its magic for only 24 hours before becoming a nonmagical gem again. The heartstone instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block above). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use etherealness or soul bind until it finds a replacement gemstone.

A successful critical hit deals triple damage.  Horrific Appearance (Su) a creature viewing the grotesque form of a nuckalavee must make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of Strength damage. This damage cannot reduce a victim's Strength score below 0, but a creature reduced to 0 is helpless. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by the horrific appearance of that nuckalavee for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Nuckalavee are not affected by the horrific appearance of other nuckalavees.

Non-creature plants in the area are affected as if by  a blight spell. Any creature that fails its Reflex save against the breath weapon must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or contract mortasheen (see below). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Disease (Su) Mortasheen: Contact; save Fort DC 21; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con and fatigue; cure 2 consecutive saves. Animals take a -2 penalty on their saves against this disease. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Obsidian Minotaur	9.00	6400	Large	0	25, touch 9, flat-footed 25	96	4	4	4				20 ft.	2 claws +17 (2d8+6 plus 1d6 fire)		10 ft.	10 ft.	breath weapon (10-ft. cube, DC 16, 1d4 Dex damage, useable every 1d4+1 rounds), burn	Str 22, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	12	19	29	Tome of Horrors Complete	Breath Weapon (Su) As a free action, once every 1d4+1 rounds, an obsidian minotaur can expel a cloud of gas directly in front of it. The cloud fills a 10-ft. cube and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Burn (Ex) The claws of an obsidian minotaur deal 1d6 points of fire damage each time they hit. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of fire damage for 1d4+1 rounds as clothes ignite and armor becomes searing hot. The save DC is Constitution-based. Immunity to Magic (Ex) An obsidian minotaur is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the obsidian minotaur's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.																												
Philosopher Golem	9.00	6400	Large	0	20, touch 9, flat-footed 20	112	5	5	9				30 ft.	platinum rod +19/+14 (1d8+5) or 2 slams +19 (2d6+5)		10 ft.	10 ft.	spells	Str 20, Dex 11, Con -, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 15	15	21	31	Tome of Horrors 4	Immunity to Magic (Ex) A philosopher golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance . In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted: A shatter spell deals damage to a philosopher golem as if it were a crystalline creature. A keen edge spell affects a philosopher golem's slam attacks as if they were slashing weapons. A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a philosopher golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no saving throw). A magical attack that deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A philosopher golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.  Spells When a philosopher golem is created, it is programmed with spells. The creator can add as many or as few spells as desired up to the limit of the golem's caster level. A philosopher golem has a caster level equal to one-half its Hit Dice. A philosopher golem does not require any spell components or focuses to cast its spells, and once a spell is cast, it is expended until the golem recharges it. To recharge its expended spells, a philosopher golem must remain idle (resting, more or less) for 8 hours.

Tormenting Howl (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a raggoth can loose a piercing howl that affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. A creature within the area must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the tormenting howl of that raggoth for 24 hours. Multiple uses of tormenting howl do not stack but do increase the duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Rakewood	9.00	6400	Large	0	24, touch 9, flat-footed 24	115	13	3	4				20 ft.	3 slams +16 (1d8+8 plus grab), bite +16 (2d6+8/19-20)		10 ft.	10 ft.	spores, swallow whole (3d6 acid damage, AC 17, 11 hp)	Str 26, Dex 10, Con 23, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 11	8	+17 (+21 grapple)	27 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Spores (Ex) As a standard action once every 1d6 rounds, a rakewood can release a cloud of deadly spores in a 20-foot-radius burst. Creatures caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. Creatures succeeding their save are sickened for 1d4 rounds instead. The cloud lasts for 1 round before dispersing. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Rift Drake	9.00	6400	Large	7	23, touch 12, flat-footed 20	126	12	10	8				30 ft., climb 20 ft., fly 60 ft.

This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 5d10 points of acid damage to all creatures within the resulting 15-foot-radius spread. Additionally, any creature damaged by this attack is affected as though by the spell slow for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 20 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the slowing effect. Once a rift drake uses its breath weapon, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Savage Bite (Ex) A rift drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.  Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a rift drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an additional move action that round.

Bleeding Aura (Su) Within the daemon's aura, blood gushes from wounds at an increased rate. All bleed effects deal an additional +2 points of damage (included in the daemon's bleed damage). Heal checks made to stop bleeding or stabilize a dying creature, Constitution checks made to  become stable, and saving throws against effects that deal bleed damage take a -4 penalty.  Contagious Gore (Su) A sangudaemon alters the very flow of blood when it attacks. Any creature that stops a bleed effect created by a sangudaemon must make a DC Fortitude save or gain the bleed effect the creature just stopped (this has no effect if the creature was stopping a bleed effect on itself ). A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Drain Soul (Su) A sangudaemon can revitalize itself by draining the soul of a dead creature. The target must be a creature the daemon dealt bleed damage to or used its blood drain ability on, and must have been dead for no longer than 1 minute. As a full-round action, it can drink the creature's soul dry, condemning the soul to Abaddon (though the soul can be returned to life as normal). The daemon gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to its Hit Dice.																												
Sargassum Fiend	9.00	6400	Large	6	24, touch 12, flat-footed 21	123	15	8	4				20 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 40 ft.	2 slams +16 (2d8+7 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	constrict (2d8+10), grab (Huge)	Str 25, Dex 14, Con 20, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 15	9	+17 (+25 grapple)	30 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Grab (Ex) A sargassum fiend can grab Huge or smaller foes, and has a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks rather than the normal +4 bonus most creatures with grab possess.  Mirage (Su) A sargassum fiend emits a powerful scent that causes specific, miragelike hallucinations. All creatures within 300 feet of a sargassum fiend must make a DC 18 Will save or become enraptured by the scent. An enraptured creature sees the monster as whatever would most compel it to approach. This might be a lost loved one, a child in need of help, an enchanting mermaid, the promise of dry land, and so on. The extent of this illusion functions as mirage arcana (CL equals the sargassum's CR), but is a mind-affecting phantasm, not a glamer. This effect ends immediately if the plant makes an attack against any target. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be slain, its spirit locked within the shoki's staff. A corporeal undead transforms into a corpse if affected by this ability, while an incorporeal undead is trapped bodily within the staff (this ability cancels a ghost's ability to rejuvenate). A spirit trapped within a shoki's staff cannot be returned to life through any means short of true resurrection, miracle, or wish. A trapped soul can be freed if the shoki wills it, or by casting banishment, dismissal, or freedom upon the staff. A shoki's staff can only contain one soul at a time. The save DC is Wisdom-based.

Once it has pinned a foe, it can attempt to behead the victim with a single gut-wrenching rip of its claws. This attempt is made as part of the grapple check to maintain an existing pin, and if successful, deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the victim. If this damage is enough to bring the target below 0 hit points, the victim must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save to resist having its head torn from its body, which results in instant death for most creatures. The save DC is Strength-based.  Dread Visage (Su) All creatures within 30 feet that can see a skull ripper must make a DC 18 Will save at the start of their turn in order to avoid becoming frightened for 1 round. If the victim recognizes any of the heads affixed to the skull ripper's body as having once belonged to friends or allies, that victim takes a -4 penalty on the save. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the dread visage of that particular skull ripper for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Su) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

If a spawning canker drains 10 points of Charisma in 1 hour, the canker immediately spawns (see below). Spawn (Ex) When a spawning canker has drained enough life force, it bursts apart into 2d4+2 slugspawn. These wormlike terrors crawl into nearby shadows and lurk in wait for any potential hosts to come nearby. The spawning canker is destroyed when this occurs. There is a 1% chance that instead of turning into slugspawn, a spawning canker transforms into a dark young of Shub-Niggurath (see page 78).

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Glowsap (Ex) As a standard action, a star monarch can spray a target within 30 feet with an adhesive spittle as a ranged touch attack. A creature struck is affected as a tanglefoot bag (Reflex DC 20 partial; see Core Rulebook 160). In addition, this adhesive glows under starlight or moonlight, limning the target as faerie fire if used outdoors at night. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Navigational Awareness (Ex) Star monarchs never become lost and are immune to maze spells or any effect that would cause them to lose their sense of direction.  Starflight (Su) A star monarch can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion).  Toxic Flesh (Ex) A star monarch's flesh is poisonous. A creature biting it or ingesting any part of its body becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 20 negates) and is affected as if it had consumed a dose of arsenic (Core Rulebook 558).

The pudding's acidic touch deals 21 points of damage per round to wooden or stone objects (including creatures it has turned to stone), but the pudding must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.  Petrifying Touch (Su) a stone pudding's touch attacks turn opponents to stone permanently. Fortitude save DC 21 negates. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A storm aurochs' powerful charge deals an additional 3d6 points of electricity damage, and its trample deals an additional 3d6 points of sonic damage, which are already included in the above statistics. If the storm aurochs is outdoors and in a stormy area-one featuring a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)-its powerful charge and trample instead deal 3d10 points of electricity or sonic damage respectively, rather than 3d6 points of damage.

Shatter Protection (Su) A thremindyr can pit its intense supernatural cold against another creature's magical protections in an attempt to wear them down or even shatter them completely. As a melee touch attack, the thremindyr can attempt to diminish the effectiveness of resist energy (cold) or protection from energy (cold) effects. If the touch attack is successful, the target is affected by a targeted dispel magic effect (caster level 11th). If the dispel check is successful, the spell protecting the target ends. This ability can affect only protection from energy (cold) or resist energy (cold) effects, and it deals no damage to the target directly.  This ability can be used at will, but each use can affect the effects of only one spell. If the target is under the effects of both spells, this ability affects protection from energy first; a separate use of this ability is needed to remove resist energy.  If a target is under the effects of resist energy (cold) or protection from energy (cold) as an effect of a magic item, the thremindyr's dispel check must overcome the item's caster level.  Creatures with inherent resistance or immunity to cold are unaffected by this ability. This does not extend to creatures that have immunity or resistance due to the effects of magic items or spells.

A creature with ticks clinging to it takes swarm damage at the end of its turn each round. As a full round action, the creature can remove the ticks with a DC 20 Reflex save. At least 10 points of damage from any area effect destroys all clinging ticks. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

The ritual takes 10 minutes to perform and the target cannot have been dead longer than one day per HD of the tombstone fairy. Additionally, the target's body must be present during the ritual and its soul must be available for return (that is, if the target's soul is trapped, such as by a trap the soul spell, this ritual automatically fails).  A target unwilling to return to life can prevent its raising by making an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone fairy's Charisma check. If the tombstone fairy wins the check, the target's soul is forced into its body and it returns to life. If the target wins the opposed check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone fairy cannot attempt to raise that same target for one month.  During the ritual a portion of the target's soul transfers to its funeral shroud or cloth. The tombstone fairy often retains this shroud so as to force compliance from the returned target.  Once the target does what the fairy desires, the tombstone fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the target's soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a resurrection, true resurrection, miracle or wish.  This ability otherwise resembles a raise dead spell.  A tombstone fairy can have only one funeral shroud (containing a target's soul) in its possession at one time.

Create Spawn (Ex) Slashing weapons, piercing weapons, and electricity attacks deal no damage to a tyrant jelly. Instead, part of the creature splits off into an ochre jelly. This new jelly has 30 hit points and fast healing 5; the tyrant jelly loses 30 hit points when it splits off. The new jelly is under the control of the tyrant jelly. A tyrant jelly with 30 hit points or fewer can't split again, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. A tyrant jelly can reabsorb an adjacent spawn as a full-round action, destroying the spawn and adding the spawn's current hit points to its own.  Poison (Ex) Slam-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Vermin Empathy (Su) A tyrant jelly can improve the attitude of vermin as a druid can with animals. Vermin have a starting attitude of unfriendly.

Its aura is a font of anarchic energy that grants fast healing 2 to the vescavor queen, as well as to any vescavor swarm within 10 feet of the queen. A vescavor queen can activate or suppress this ability as a free action.  Gibber (Su) Like their broods, vescavor queens yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor queen must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves can't be affected by the same vescavor queen's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spit Acid (Ex) As a standard action, a vescavor queen can spit acid at a foe within 30 feet. With a successful ranged touch attack, the target is hit with a glob of acid and takes 5d6 points of acid damage. In addition, the spit of a vescavor queen contains some of its pheromones. Any target that takes damage from this attack acts as a beacon for any vescavor swarms; the damaged creature takes a -8 penalty on Stealth checks against the vescavor queen and swarms it controls, and likely becomes the swarm's next target.  Swarm Mother (Su) A vescavor queen can mentally control up to 20 Hit Dice of vescavor swarms through a combination of supernatural pheromones and magical manipulation. To control a vescavor swarm, the vescavor queen must be able to see it and must be within 120 feet of it. Attempting to control a vescavor swarm is a standard action, and the swarm can attempt to resist this attempt with a DC 17 Will save. If the swarm fails this save, the vescavor queen can issue a simple mental command as a swift action, like "fight," "come here," "go there," or "stay still." Vescavor swarms affected by this ability act normally unless a vescavor queen is actively controlling them, but never attack the vescavor queen. The save DC is Charisma-based. In addition, a vescavor queen is immune to a vescavor swarm's swarm attacks and supernatural special abilities. A vescavor queen can release a vescavor swarm from its control as a free action. If a vescavor queen is killed, any vescavor swarms under its control disperse.

A DC 17 Reflex save halves this damage. For each additional vrock that joins in the dance, the damage increases by 5d6 and the DC to avoid the effect increases by +1, to a maximum of 20d6 when four or more vrocks are dancing (the DC continues to increase with additional vrocks, but the damage does not). The dance immediately ends and must be started anew if any of the participating vrocks is slain, stunned, or otherwise prevented from dancing. The save DC is Charisma-based. Spores (Ex) A vrock can release a cloud of spores from its body once every 3 rounds as a free action. Adjacent creatures take 1d8 points of damage from the spores, plus 1d4 points of damage per round for 10 rounds as the spores grow into thick green vines. Although ugly, the vines are harmless and wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The spores can be destroyed by casting bless on the affected creatures or by sprinkling them with holy water. This attack can also be halted by effects that remove or provide immunity to disease. Stunning Screech (Su) Once per hour, a vrock can emit a shrill screech. All creatures except demons within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Dazzler (Ex) As a standard action, a warden robot can target a single creature with a beam of strobing light that functions as a gaze attack with a range of 60 feet. A creature subject to this attack must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be blinded for 2d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save are dazzled for 1d4 rounds. Creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. This is a light effect, and the save DC is Intelligence-based.  Infrasonic Field (Ex) Warden robots constantly emit powerful sound waves at a frequency below normal hearing. These vibrations can debilitate living beings within 30 feet. Such creatures must succeed at DC 17 Fortitude save or fall prone and be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A warden robot can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is Intelligence-based.  Integrated Sonic Disruptor (Ex) A warden robot's arms contain built-in ranged weapons that emit focused sound waves in 100-foot rays that deal 2d8 points of sonic damage.  Reactive Armor (Ex) A warden robot is covered in a special shell that reacts explosively to powerful strikes. Due to this covering, a warden robot gains light fortification (25% chance to negate critical hits and sneak attacks). When the armor negates a critical hit from a melee weapon, the attacker takes an amount of fire damage equal to half of the damage dealt to the robot. Attackers using reach or ranged weapons avoid this damage.  Resilient (Ex) Warden robots receive a +3 racial bonus on all saving throws.

Although spawn so created are less powerful than wight lords, they are more powerful than typical wights, and are treated as wights with the advanced simple template. Spawn are under the command of the wight lord that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they become fullfledged, free-willed advanced wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Energy Drain (Su) A wight lord inflicts a negative level each time it hits a foe with a slam attack. Like cairn wights, a wight lord can channel this negative energy through any weapon it wields, inflicting a negative level with each successful hit with the weapon. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) While a wight lord is vulnerable to resurrection magic, it isn't quite as vulnerable as a typical wight. A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight lord staggers it for 1d6+1 rounds if it fails a Will save, but does not destroy the wight. Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.

While these eerie flames deal no additional damage, the affected creature glows as per faerie fire and becomes sickened. While under the effects of the witchflame, the victim gains vulnerability to fire and takes half again as much damage (+50%) from fire attacks of any sort. This effect persists for 10 minutes. The supernatural flames can only be extinguished before this duration expires by a break enchantment, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell-the effective caster level of the witchflame is equal to the witchfire's HD (CL 10th for most witchfires). Any creature entering the same square as a witchfire or striking it with a melee attack must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or begin burning with witchflame, even if the attack would not otherwise harm the witchfire because of its incorporeal nature. A bolt of witchflame has a range of 60 feet with no range increment. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

If it hits, the feeding tentacles siphon away the victim's emotions and deal 1d4 points of Charisma drain. The yangethe heals 5 points of damage for every point of Charisma it drains in this manner. As long as a creature continues to suffer this Charisma drain, each time it attempts to sleep it is affected by a nightmare spell (CL 10th, DC 20), experiencing terrifying dreams in which it relives the feeling of being fed upon over and over. All effects from the feeding tentacles are mind-affecting effects.  Psychic Blast (Sp) This spell-like ability functions as confusion, and also deals 10d6 points of nonlethal damage when it first affects foes (Will DC 21 half). This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.																												
Yithian	9.00	6400	Large	1	23, touch 10, flat-footed 22	105	9	5	15				20 ft., climb 10 ft.	2 pincers +15 (2d8+9/x3)		10 ft.	10 ft.	amnesia, deadly pincers, mind swap	Str 22, Dex 13, Con 17, Int 24, Wis 19, Cha 18	10	17	28	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Amnesia (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a yithian can attempt to inflict amnesia on a target it is able to communicate telepathically with. A target can resist this  attack with a DC 21 Will save. If the target fails its save, it takes a permanent -4 penalty on Will saving throws and all skill checks, and loses all memories save for those the yithian chooses to leave intact. This effect can be cured by heal or greater restoration. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Deadly Pincers (Ex) A yithian always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its pincer attacks, and deals triple damage on a critical hit. Pincers are primary attacks for yithians.  Mind Swap (Su) As a full-round action, a yithian can trade minds with another living creature it is able to communicate telepathically with. This functions as magic jar, except the two minds trade bodies. An unwilling target can resist the mind swap with a DC 21 Will save, after which that particular yithian cannot attempt to swap minds with that creature again for 24 hours. The yithian can end the effect of this mind swap at any time and over any distance as a full-round action, instantly returning both minds to the proper bodies-if the yithian wishes, it may attempt to use its amnesia power on the other mind as a free action when it ends the mind swap in this way. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Scholar (Ex) Yithians treat all knowledge skills as class skills.

Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)  A gray dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.  • Young-fog cloud;  • Juvenile-create water;  • Old-control winds;  • Ancient-control water;  Water Breathing (Ex) A gray dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.

This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.

A deaf yrthak is effectively blinded as well except against adjacent foes-its weak eyesight functions enough for it to attack targets this close, although in such cases these creatures still gain the benefit of concealment (20% miss chance) because of the creature's poor vision. It is invulnerable to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks.  Explosion (Ex) As a standard action, a yrthak can fire its sonic lance at the ground, a large rock, a stone wall, or a similar nonmagical object within 60 feet to create an explosion.  This attack deals 2d6 points of piercing damage to all within 10 feet of the effect's center.

Thrash (Ex) A zeuglodon grappling a foe can thrash its body back and forth rapidly, dealing extra damage due to the violent motion of its whipping head. This attack deals 4d8+19 points of damage, but allows the grappled creature a free attempt to escape the grapple. If a creature escapes, it is thrown 30 feet in a random direction by the zeuglodon's erratic thrashing.

It can store items in a special compartment within its stomach and activate them as if it were holding them. It can swallow or regurgitate an item as a standard action.  Endless Coils (Ex) As a full-round action, an abaia can attempt a single combat maneuver check to grapple up to two Large or four Medium or smaller creatures within its reach. Any targets successfully grabbed take constrict damage. The abaia only needs to succeed at one grapple check to maintain a grapple against multiple opponents.  Wave Rider (Su) An abaia moving onto land brings a sheath of water with it, allowing it to swim on land. Its swim speed drops by 10 feet at the start of its turn if it is out of the water, and the sheath dissipates entirely when the abaia's swim speed reaches 20 feet. An abaia wave riding on land retains its spell resistance but loses its bonus to Stealth.

Magically altered terrain affects an adlet normally.  Frozen Breath (Su) An adlet's breath is supernaturally cold, and deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage with its bite. Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, it can exhale, filling a 10-footradius spread around it with frigid air that deals 2d6 points of cold damage and staggers those in the area with numbing cold for 1d6 rounds.

Ray Reflection (Ex) An ancient crystal dragon's scales reflect ray spells back upon the ray's source if the ray fails to overcome the dragon's spell resistance.  Scintillating Aura (Su) A great wyrm crystal dragon radiates an aura of scintillating color from its jeweled scales to a radius of 60 feet. All within this area must make a Will save each round to avoid being stunned (if the victim has 15 or fewer Hit Dice) or confused (if the victim has more than 15 Hit Dice) for 1 round. The save DC is equal to the dragon's breath weapon save DC. This is a mind-affecting effect. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A crystal dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) upon reaching the listed age category. Very young-color spray; Juvenile-glitterdust; Adult-rainbow pattern; Old- stone to flesh (3/day); Ancient-prismatic spray (3/day); Great wyrm-imprisonment (1/day).

Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.

This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does. Cold Aura (Su) An adult white dragon radiates an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Freezing Fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice. Ice Tomb (Sp) A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature. A magical attack that uses negative energy (such as channel negative energy, inflict light wounds, or enervation) deals no damage, but speeds up the aluum's attacks and movement as if it were under the effects of a haste spell for 1d6 rounds. A magical attack that uses positive energy slows the aluum as if by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds and dispels any haste effects currently affecting it. Magic jar confuses the creature for 1d6 rounds.  Paralysis (Su) The touch of an aluum paralyzes living creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Soul Shriek (Su) As a free action every 1d4 rounds, the aluum's enslaved souls may emit a keening wail in a 15-foot cone.  Creatures in the cone take 10d6 points of sonic damage and are stunned for 1 round. A DC 15 Will save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. This is a sonic mindaffecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A creature that successfully saves against the baba yaga's aura is unaffected by the same baba yaga's aura for one day. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. A baba yaga can suppress or restart this aura as a free action.  Evil Eye (Su) As a standard action, a baba yaga can crush the will of a foe within 30 feet that she can see. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the evil eye is removed. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Intelligence-based. A creature currently affected by a baba yaga's evil eye cannot be affected again (by the same or a different  Decaying Hex (Su) As a standard action, a baba yaga can place a hex on any living creature within 60 feet. If the creature fails a DC 22 Fortitude save it takes 3d6 points of damage plus 2d6 bleed damage. A creature that fails its save by 5 or more also takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. The bleeding can be stopped with a DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any magical healing. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  Spells A baba yaga casts spells as a 12th-level witch (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide). They do not gain access to any other witch abilities.  Swamp Stride (Ex) A baba yaga can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.																												
Bebilith	10.00	9600	Huge	5	22, touch 9, flat-footed 21	150	15	11	7				40 ft., climb 20 ft.	bite +19 (2d6+9 plus rot) and 2 claws +19 (2d4+9/19-20)		15 ft.	15 ft.	dismantle armor, penetrating strike, web (+11  ranged, DC 23, 12 hp)	Str 28, Dex 12, Con 24, Int 11, Wis 13, Cha 13	12	23	34 (46 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary	Dismantle Armor (Ex) If a bebilith hits a foe with both claw attacks, it can attempt to peel away the target's armor and shield as a free action by making a CMB check.  If the bebilith is successful, the target's armor and shield are torn from his body and dismantled, falling to the ground. Armor subjected to this attack loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition if the target fails a DC 25 Reflex save. The save DC is Strength-based.  Penetrating Strike (Su) A bebilith's natural weapons are treated as chaotic and magical for the purposes of penetrating damage reduction. Against creatures with the demon type, its natural weapons are also treated as cold iron and good.  Rot (Su) A bebilith's bite causes a horrible withering and weakening of the flesh, resulting in a hideous melting and foul rotting effect. This catastrophic withering begins on the round the creature is bitten and continues for another 4 rounds thereafter, for 5 rounds of withering in all. Each round the rot persists, the target must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution damage. If the target makes two consecutive saving throws in a row, the effect is cured. Heal can also halt the rot effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Behemoth Hippopotamus	10.00	9600	Huge	3	23, touch 7, flat-footed 23	133	+14 (+16 vs. nonmagical disease)	8	7	sweat			50 ft.	bite +17 (4d8+13/19-20 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	capsize, trample (2d6+13, DC 26)	Str 29, Dex 8, Con 20, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 5	10	+21 (+25 grapple)	30 (34 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2

Its natural attacks are considered to have the ghost touch special ability, and each of its natural attacks deals an additional 2d6 points of force damage. This damage is doubled when a birelu makes a powerful charge.  Spirit Walk (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a birelu can merge itself with a single humanoid or animal. This ability is similar to the magic jar spell (caster level 13th), except it doesn't require a receptacle. To use this ability, the birelu must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the  same birelu's spirit walk ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Additionally, a creature affected by this ability undergoes a physical transformation, growing either more beastlike or more humanlike, depending on its original form. A humanoid affected by this ability is affected as by greater animal aspectUC. The birelu chooses the aspect gained from this effect. This aspect can't be changed, though the birelu can select a new aspect if it merges with the same creature again at a later time. An animal affected by the spirit walk ability is affected as by anthropomorphic animalUM. Either effect lasts for as long as the creature remains possessed by the birelu, ending once the birelu leaves the creature's body.

This aura manifests as a shifting haze of images that reflect the viewer's deepest fears. The first time it  ends its turn within the aura, a creature must make a DC 25 Will save or become shaken for as long as it stays within the aura. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.  Striking Fear (Su) If a bogeyman confirms a critical hit or a sneak attack with one of its claws on a target currently suffering a fear effect, that effect automatically becomes one step more severe (shaken creatures become frightened, frightened creatures become panicked, and panicked creatures cower in fear). A DC 25 Will save negates this increase. In addition, a critical hit from the bogeyman's claw forces any target that has successfully saved against the creature's fear aura to make another Will save against its effects, even if 24 hours have not yet passed. This is a fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.  Terrible Rejuvenation (Su) A bogeyman gains fast healing 5 while any creature within its deepest fear aura is suffering from a fear effect, including any fear effect created by the aura itself.

Charisma damage, memory loss	Str 13, Dex 16, Con 19, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 17	9	11	24	Tome of Horrors Complete	Charisma Damage (Su) Any creature touched or hit by a brume takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage.  A creature reduced to Charisma 0 by a brume dies.  Memory Loss (Su) An opponent hit by a brume's claw attack must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or forget everything that has happened in the last 1d6 hours (treat this as a modify memory spell).  The save DC is Constitution-based. Even if the save is successful, the opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell (caster level 13th) for 2d4 hours.  The confusion effects can be removed using break enchantment, dispel magic, or greater magic.  Insubstantial Form (Ex) A brume's insubstantial form gives it immunity to poison and critical hits. It cannot run, wear armor, or enter water or other liquids. It can pass through holes and small openings-even cracks. It can also occupy spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a gaseous form spell-note the brume is not subject to wind effects like the gaseous form spell allows.) Any piercing or slashing attack against a brume has a 20% miss chance.  Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally.  Lifesense (Su) A brume can automatically pinpoint the location of any living creature within 120 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.  Natural Invisibility (Ex) A brume is effectively invisible in fog, smoke, or mist.																												
Burning Child	10.00	9600	Small	7	17, touch 15, flat-footed 13	150	9	12	11	channel resistance +4, final embrace		vulnerable to cold	40 ft.	slam +10 (1d4-2 plus burn)		5 ft.	5 ft.	breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 10d6 fire damage, Reflex DC 21 half), burn (2d8, DC 21)	Str 6, Dex 17, Con -, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 18	7	14	17	Belkzen Hold Of The Orc Hordes	Binary State (Su) Most of the time the Burning Child is in a passive state, during which he's incorporeal and invisible, though his soft sobs and the scent of burning flesh allow a creature to pinpoint his location with a successful DC 30 Perception check. If the Burning Child comes across a battle, the chance he enters his active state is equal to 1% per creature fighting (to a maximum of 100%). While active, the Burning Child is corporeal and visible. After 1d4 hours without being attacked or seeing conflict, the Burning Child reenters his passive state.  Breath Weapon (Su) The Burning Child can use his breath weapon only when in his active state, and only once each time he becomes active.  Final Embrace (Ex) If the Burning Child is destroyed, he reforms in 2d4 days. He can be permanently destroyed only when active, by a humanoid embracing and calming him. This requires succeeding at DC 28 Diplomacy checks for 3 consecutive rounds.																												
Clay Golem	10.00	9600	Large	-1	24, touch 8, flat-footed 24	101	4	3	4				20 ft.	2 slams +19 (2d10+7 plus cursed wound)		10 ft.	10 ft.	berserk, haste	Str 24, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	13	21	30	PFRPG Bestiary	Berserk (Ex) When a clay golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. This chance resets to 0% after one minute of inactivity. A berserk golem attacks the nearest living creature or smashes some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach. Once it goes berserk, no known method can reestablish control.  Cursed Wound (Ex) The damage a clay golem deals doesn't heal naturally and resists magical healing. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by a clay golem must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature.  Haste (Su) After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a clay golem can haste itself once per day as a free action. The effect lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A clay golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A move earth spell drives the golem back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it (no save).  • A disintegrate spell slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage (no save).  • An earthquake spell cast directly at a clay golem stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage (no save).  • Any magical attack against a clay golem that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A clay golem gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage.

Str 24, Dex 17, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	13	21	36 (can't be tripped)	Wardens Of The Reborn Forge	Eidite Trail (Ex) A clockwork snail can release a noxious trail of poisonous ooze, coating any surface it treads upon with viscous liquid eidite. Any square that the clockwork snail moves through while this ability is active is covered in a nonmagical web effect that acts in all ways as the spell (DC 16 negates), but also has a chance of infecting whoever touches it with eidite sickness (see page 19). A clockwork snail can activate or deactivate this ability as a swift action, and can cover a total of 40 squares per day, though these squares need not be consecutive. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Improved Charge (Ex) A clockwork snail excels at charging into enemies; it can move up to triple its speed when using the charge action, and ignores any effects of difficult terrain while charging.  Tracks (Ex) A clockwork snail's tracks allow it to climb even sheer surfaces with ease, granting it a +16 racial bonus on Climb checks instead of the usual +8 for having a climb speed, and it can make attacks with its upper body normally even while climbing.																												
Colour Out Of Space	10.00	9600	Huge	12	23, touch 23, flat-footed 14	126	10	14	10	amorphous, incorporeal	21	susceptible to force effects	30 ft., fly 50 ft.

While under this effect, the creature takes a -4 penalty on all Will saving throws, and doesn't willingly travel farther than a mile from the area where it failed its saving throw against that colour's aura of lassitude. A break enchantment spell (DC 22) ends the effect, as does removing the victim from the aura's area of effect. Every 24 hours, a creature affected by an aura of lassitude can attempt a new DC 22 Will save to cast off the effects of the aura. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to that colour's aura of lassitude for 24 hours. A creature that is under the effects of an aura of lassitude from a colour out of space can't be further affected by this ability from other colours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Disintegrating Touch (Su) A colour's touch causes a terrible disintegration of flesh and bone. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save halves the damage caused by a colour out of space's touch attack. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a colour out of space's touch attack must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be immediately slain and reduced to a pile of fine ash. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Feed (Su) A colour can attempt to feed on any living creature or a region of plant life as a full-round action. If it feeds on a single creature, the colour must have line of sight and be within 300 feet of the target. If it feeds on a region of plant and animal life, it only needs to be within that region. It can attempt to feed on a region once per week, and upon a living creature at will (but only once per day per living creature). Feeding on a region of plant life is automatically successful, blighting that region of plant life as if by a diminish plants spell used to stunt growth. A creature can resist being fed upon by a colour out of space by succeeding at a DC 22 Will save, in which case the colour must wait 24 hours before attempting to feed on that creature again. If this saving throw fails, the victim takes 1d4 points of Charisma drain and Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature whose Constitution score is drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack immediately dies, crumbling into a mass of desiccated tissue. A creature whose Charisma score is drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack gains the colour-blighted simple template (see the facing page). Every time a colour successfully feeds on a creature, it gains 1 growth point. A colour out of space can never have more than 100 growth points-it can expend 100 growth points after spending 24 hours concentrating on its growth, and in so doing gains 1 permanent Hit Die.  Susceptible to Force Effects (Ex) A colour out of space takes half again as much damage (+50%) from force effects, and takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws to resist force effects. A colour out of space can't damage force effects with its disintegrating touch. Its aura of lassitude and feed ability is blocked if the colour is completely entrapped by force effects (such as by a windowless cell version of forcecage or a telekinetic sphere).

They can wield these contracts like whips, but deal lethal damage regardless of the armor bonus of their target. A contract devil modifies attack and damage rolls when using a binding contract by its Intelligence modifier, not its Strength modifier (this equates to a +7 bonus for most contract devils). Wounds created by a binding contract resemble horrifically deep paper cuts and cause 1d6 points of bleed damage. A contract devil can use its binding contract to disarm and trip foes as if the contract were a whip. If it is itself disarmed of the contract, the devil can rearm itself with a new contract as an immediate action.  Impale (Ex) As a swift action, a contract devil can impale an opponent grappled by its binding contract, dealing 2d8+4 points of piercing damage.  Infernal Contract (Su) As a full-round action, a contract devil can produce an infernal contract for a single living mortal creature. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, as detailed on the following page. To receive any of these bonuses, however, the mortal must sign its true name to the document of its own free will. Upon doing so, that mortal's soul is sworn to the contract devil, condemning the soul to an eternity of servitude in Hell rather than whatever fate would naturally befall it upon the mortal's death. Breaking a contract with a contract devil is difficult and dangerous (see the next page); as long as the infernal contract remains in effect, the victim cannot be restored to life after death save by a miracle or a wish. If a mortal is restored to life in this way, the contract devil immediately senses the development-it not only knows which soul has been restored to life, but also gains the benefits of a discern location spell targeted on the character or creature that restored the damned soul to life.  Infernal Investment (Su) As a subclause of all infernal contracts, a contract devil can use greater scrying at will upon any creature it has a contract with. The target creature always fails its save against the devil's scrying attempt-this ability otherwise functions at caster level 20th.

Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a couatl, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.  Poison (Ex) Injury-bite; save Fortitude DC 16; frequency 1/ minute for 10 minutes; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC is Constitution-based.

Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the crimson death, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex (DC 18) save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they are pushed back or aside (target's choice) as the crimson death moves forward. Engulfed opponents gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, are trapped within the crimson death's body until they are no longer pinned, and suffer 1d6 points of damage and 1d6 points of Constitution damage every round. A victim reduced to 0 Constitution dies. The save DC is Strength-based.  Susceptibility (Ex) After draining its victim's Constitution, the crimson death, sated from its feeding, moves at half its normal speed, loses its racial bonus to Stealth checks (because it flushes crimson, hence the name), and suffers a -4 circumstance penalty to AC. These effects last for 1 hour.																												
Derakni	10.00	9600	Large	10	25, touch 15, flat-footed 19	126	13	13	7		21		30 ft., fly 60 ft.

A derakni must fly at least 10 feet to activate this ability (which it can do as a free action as part of its move action). Any non-demon creature that begins its turn within 30 feet of a derakni that moved in this manner on its previous turn must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that makes this save is immune to the drone of that derakni for 24 hours. Demons are immune to this sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Bite or sting-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Daemons are immune to this effect, but all other creatures must make a DC 18 Will save to resist its effects. The effect lasts for 6 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charismabased.  Tear (Ex) If a derghodaemon grapples an opponent, it automatically hits its opponent with all of its melee attacks each round following that it maintains its hold.

For every point so drained, the devouring mist heals 5 hit points of damage. Creatures without blood take no damage from the devouring mist.  Create Spawn (Su) Any creature slain by a devouring mist rises as a vampire spawn in 1d4 days, unless the remains are blessed. If the victim had more than 5 hit dice, there is a 1% chance per hit die that it arises as a full-fledged vampire instead, or a 5% chance per hit die if the victim was of the humanoid type.

Opponents in the affected area must succeed on a DC 26 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking 2d8+15 points of bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the creature moves off them. If the creature chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Strength-based.  Ethereal Ambush (Ex) A dimensional slug that attacks foes on the Material Plane in a surprise round can take a full round of actions if it begins the combat by phasing into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane.  Ethereal Jaunt (Su) A dimensional slug can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or as part of a move action). The ability is otherwise identical to ethereal jaunt (CL 15th).  Spit Acid (Ex) A dimensional slug can spit acid at an opponent within 60 feet (no range increment). With a successful ranged touch attack, the target takes 12d6 points of acid damage (no save).  Malleable (Ex) A dimensional slug's body is very malleable, allowing it to fit into narrow areas with ease. A dimensional slug takes no penalty to its speed or checks when squeezing in an area that is one size category smaller than its actual size (10 feet wide for most dimensional slugs). A dimensional slug can squeeze normally through an area two size categories smaller than its actual size (5 feet wide for most dimensional slugs).  Vulnerability to Salt (Ex) A handful of salt burns a dimensional slug as if the salt were a flask of acid, causing 1d6 points of damage per use.

Cling (Ex) A combination of magnetic pads and electrostatic emitters in its feet allow a director robot to climb and travel on vertical or horizontal surfaces without having to attempt Climb checks, even allowing it to traverse these surfaces while upside down.  Electromagnetic Pulse (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a director robot can unleash an electromagnetic pulse that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to any robots or creatures with cybernetic implants within a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 20 half). This bypasses any active force fields or similar effects, but doesn't harm other living creatures or the director robot. Any technological item within this radius is drained of 1d6 charges unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Reflex save. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.  Grasping Tentacles (Ex) A director robot's tentacles are primary attacks and have the grab special ability.  Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex) A director robot has a built-in laser rifle. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 2d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through force fields and force effects, such as a wall of force, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover  in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment.  Override (Ex) A director robot can usurp control of an otherwise functional robot. In order to gain control of a robot, the director robot must first make a ranged touch attack against a target robot within a range of 60 feet. If the attack is successful, the targeted robot must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw to prevent the director robot from linking to the target's command processor. On any subsequent turn after a link is established, the director robot can issue a command to the targeted robot as a standard action. The targeted robot can attempt another Will save (DC 20) to resist following each command.  To command its target, the director robot must be within 60 feet of the targeted robot and must issue the command in a language the robot understands. The types of commands it can issue are similar to those allowed by a suggestion spell-once a command is successfully issued, the robot does its best to carry out the orders over the course of the next hour. Additionally, any robot affected by this ability also gains a +2 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. These save DCs are Intelligence-based.  Repair Robot (Ex) As a standard action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, a director robot can repair damage done to either itself or an adjacent creature with the robot subtype, healing the target for 1d10 points of damage.																												
Dracohydra	10.00	9600	Huge	1	20, touch 9, flat-footed 19	105	11	10	5	all-around vision			30 ft., swim 20 ft.	5 bites +14 (2d6+5/19-20)		15 ft.	10 ft.	5 breath weapons (30-ft. cone, DC 19, 4d6 damage; see text), savage bite	Str 21, Dex 12, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 12	10	14	23 (31 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Breath Weapon (Su) Each of a dracohydra's heads has a single breath weapon. To determine each head's color and the associated breath weapon, choose from or roll on the table below.  1d10 Head Color Breath Weapon  1-2 Black Acid  3-4 Blue Electricity  5-6 Green Acid  7-8 Red Fire  9-10 White Cold  Fast Healing (Ex) A dracohydra's fast healing applies only to damage inflicted on the dracohydra's body.  Hydra Traits (Ex) A dracohydra can be killed by severing its heads or slaying its body. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and 10 hit points. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals 10 points of damage to the dracohydra's body. A dracohydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties.  Regenerate Head (Ex) When a dracohydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. The heads are of the same color as the one that was severed. A dracohydra cannot have more than 10 heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage (after overcoming the dracohydra's resistances) must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A dracohydra doesn't die from losing its heads until all are cut off and the stumps seared by acid or fire.  Savage Bite (Ex) A dracohydra applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.

A dragonship never gets lost on an ocean voyage, and has a 50% chance of automatically being aware of any safe coastline, seaside towns and villages, and hidden ocean dangers such as reefs and sandbars (it only knows of such dangers if they are in the volume of sea charts used in its creation).  Winds (Su) At will, a dragonship can cause winds to fill its sails. This operates as the control winds spell (caster level 10th) with the restriction that it can only increase the wind's force for the purposes of propulsion. The winds are generated from a point beyond and slightly above the dragonship's stern. A dragonship cannot use these winds to attack; their sole purpose is propulsion.

Armor never impacts an einherji's speed, nor does an einherji take armor check penalties on Ride checks.  Challenge of Single Combat (Ex) As a standard action, an einherji can choose a single target within sight to challenge by attempting an Intimidate check to demoralize that creature. If the check succeeds, the target is shaken and the einherji gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that target. For the duration of the challenge, the einherji must attack that target, and takes a -2 penalty to its AC, except against attacks made by the target. The challenge (and the shaken condition) remains in effect until the target successfully attacks the einherji in melee combat, the target is dead or unconscious, or the combat ends.  Thirst for Battle (Su) As long as an einherji is in battle (i.e., each round it makes an attack roll), it gains fast healing 5. An einherji loses this ability outside of combat or if knocked unconscious.																												
Elder Salt Elemental	10.00	9600	Huge	0	22, touch 10, flat-footed 20	114	12	5	8			vulnerability to water	20 ft.	2 claws +18 (2d8+7 plus salt poisoning)		15 ft.	15 ft.	salt poisoning (15 rounds, DC 20)	Str 25, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 11	12	21	33	Tome of Horrors 4	Dehydration Aura (Su) A salt elemental's aura draws moisture from an area centered on itself. Living creatures within range take damage (damage is detailed with each elemental) each round they remain in the area. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. This effect is especially devastating to plants, animals, and aquatic creatures, which take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Earth Mastery (Ex) A salt elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)  Salt Poisoning (Ex) Anyone hit by a salt elemental's claw attack is sickened for 3 rounds + 1 round per Hit Dice of the salt elemental. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A salt elemental submerged in water that covers at least half its body takes 1d6 points of damage each round until it escapes. Damage from water-based attacks (such as the slam attack of a water elemental) deal +50% damage to a salt elemental.

Any creature within 120 feet that attempts to move during its turn must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be forced to move toward the estuarine worm instead of in its intended direction. This ability is otherwise treated a gaze attack. This ability is a mind-affecting illusion (pattern) effect, though vermin are not immune to this effect. The estuarine worm can activate and deactivate this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Seasonal Transformation (Ex) An estuarine worm has two forms: ahket (wet season) and shemu (dry season). In its shemu form, the estuarine worm is one size category smaller than when it's in its ahket form. Further, its Strength and Dexterity decrease by 8 and it loses its damage reduction. It also loses its guiding star ability and its willful special quality. Its natural armor bonus increases by 8 and it gains DR 15/ bludgeoning. In addition, all of the creature's movement speeds are decreased by 10 feet.  An estuarine worm assumes its shemu form if it goes 24 hours without exposure to water. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a control water (lower water), greater polymorph, flesh to stone, or transmute mud to rock spell immediately shifts to its shemu form (instead of experiencing the spell's normal effect).  An estuarine worm takes on ahket form if it is submerged in water for 24 hours. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a control water (raise water), greater polymorph, stone to flesh, or transmute rock to mud spell immediately shifts to its ahket form (instead of experiencing the spell's normal effect).  Willful (Ex) In ahket form, an estuarine worm gains a +4 competence bonus to Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.

Festering Lung	10.00	9600	Medium	5	15, touch 15, flat-footed 10	52	8	10	5	evasion		swarm traits, vulnerability to remove disease	fly 10 ft.

Such a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save each round that it is in the swarm or take ability damage for that round as indicated under the disease type. There is no incubation period for this type of exposure and its method of delivery is irrelevant due to the sheer concentration of disease organisms present. Even after a creature leaves the area of a swarm, it must make the appropriate Fortitude save or continue to take ability damage each day as indicated by the disease. At this point two successful saving throws in a row indicate that the creature has fought off the disease and recovers, taking no more damage. However, the disease can be contracted again through regular exposure or another encounter with a living disease. Once a creature has made a successful saving throw against the disease of a living disease, it is immune to future bouts of disease of that particular living disease for 1 year.  Festering Lung: This infection gets into the lungs of the affected creature and begins to break down the respiratory system, producing choking and copious amounts of bloody phlegm. It saps the strength from the victim due to poor oxygenation and renders him unable to speak or make any vocal noises two days after contraction. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to festering lung.  Festering Lung: Swarm-inhaled; save DC 24 Fort; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage and 1d4 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Evasion (Ex) Due to its composition of billions of highly resilient microscopic organisms, if it makes a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, a living disease instead takes no damage. It is identical to the rogue ability of the same name.  Lifesense (Ex) The overpowering drive to propagate itself gives a living disease the ability to notice and locate living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Vulnerability to Remove Disease (Ex) If a remove disease is cast on a living disease or a victim currently in a space occupied by a living disease and the living disease fails a Fortitude save against the spell, it deals 5d10 points of damage to the living disease. A creature that has remove disease cast on it is not cured unless outside of the swarm's area when the spell is cast or unless the living disease was destroyed by the casting of the spell. Otherwise, an infected creature will require an additional remove disease upon leaving the living disease's space if it contracted the disease while within.

Additionally, 1d4 minutes after falling, a fext gains fast healing 1. To be completely destroyed, a fext must be reduced to 0 hit points by a glass or obsidian weapon or, once a fext is rendered unconscious, its head must be severed and anointed with holy water.

Scalding Blast (Su) As a full round action, a fire whale can release a blast of superheated air from its blowhole that scalds or burns those contacting it. The cone-shaped blast has a range of 60 ft and deals 12d6 points of damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Once a fire whale uses this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using its scalding blast again. After using this ability four times, the fire whale must submerge for at least two full rounds before it can use it again.

Rend Armor (Ex) When a forgefiend hits with a bite attack, it chews any armor worn by the target-this grants the forgefiend a free sunder attempt against armor worn by the target if the victim fails a DC 22 Reflex save. A forgefiend also gains Greater Sunder and Improved Sunder as bonus feats. The save DC is Strength-based.  Searing Spew (Su) A forgefiend can belch forth a searing pile of slag from its body maw as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This blob of molten metal affects any 10-foot-square area adjacent to the forgefiend. Any creature in this area takes 14d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 22 halves). The slag quickly cools, forming a rugged pile of worthless scrap and misshapen metal that is treated as difficult terrain-this stuff crumbles to powder in 1 hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.

All creatures caught in this boiling seawater take 4d8 points of fire damage. Creatures spending 2 or more consecutive rounds subjected to this damage must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Dying Gasp (Su) When a gargiya is killed, it disgorges from its gullet the molten boulder that heats its body. Its fiery death throes deal 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC 22 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Scalding Scales (Ex) A gargiya generates such intense heat that anything touching it takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Creatures striking a gargiya with natural attacks or unarmed strikes are subject to this damage. Any metal weapon striking a gargiya must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or melt, gaining the broken condition. A metal weapon that fails a second save is destroyed. Wooden weapons are destroyed after only one failed save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Engulf (Ex) A gelatinous golem can try to wrap an opponent up to one size smaller than itself in its body as a standard action. The gelatinous golem attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple the gelatinous golem establishes a hold. Attacks that hit an engulfing gelatinous golem deal half their damage to the golem and half to the engulfed victim. An engulfed opponent is subjected to the gelatinous golem's paralysis and acid each round it remains trapped. A trapped opponent can do nothing other than attempt to escape. Further, an engulfed foe must hold its breath or begin drowning (see the Core Rulebook for the drowning rules). While engulfing an opponent, a gelatinous golem is not considered grappled and can move and attack normally. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A gelatinous golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A cone of cold spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. An acid fog spell heals all of its lost hit points. Transparent (Ex) A gelatinous golem is hard to see, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Perception check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a gelatinous golem and walk into it are automatically grappled (if the golem chooses to grapple the opponent).

Any creature within 50 feet of the ghawwas, within the same body of water, and at least half submerged takes 6d6 points of fire damage (Fortitude DC 23 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Rough Hide (Ex) Ghawwas have rough hides studded with jagged barbs and spiny protrusions.

The bonus to hit points is Constitution-based.  Filth Fever (Ex) Disease-injury; save Fort DC 25; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Powerful Stench (Ex) An enraged ghonhatine secretes a tarry, musk-like chemical. Any living, non-ghonhatine creature within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. A creature that saves is sickened as long as it remains in the area, and can't be affected again by the same ghonhatine's stench for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Regurgitate (Ex) A ghonhatine can expel the contents of its stomach as a ranged attack with a splash weapon that has a range increment of 20 feet. It deals 2d6 acid damage to the target and splashes all adjacent creatures. In addition to taking damage, a target directly hit by a ghonhatine's regurgitation must make two DC 24 Fortitude saves, the first to resist contracting filth fever, and the second to avoid being nauseated for 1 minute. A nauseated creature can end its nausea early by dousing itself in a gallon of water. All creatures adjacent to the target must make DC 24 Fortitude saves to avoid being sickened for 1 minute. Once a ghonhatine uses this ability it can't use it again until it feeds. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes.  The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that require line of sight or line of effect. A giant flytrap that is grappling or pinning a foe cannot attack other targets with that bite, but is not otherwise hindered.

A metal creature or creature wearing metal armor that begins its turn within the globe's aura must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or fall prone; standing up from prone within the aura is a standard action for such creatures. Such a creature that enters the globe's aura must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or be pushed back 5 feet, ending its movement. On its turn, the gravitic globe can attempt a bull rush, pull, or trip combat maneuver against a single metal or metal-wearing creature within its aura as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, it can attempt a disarm or steal combat maneuver targeting a metal weapon or item within its aura as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The erratic magnetic field surrounding the globe grants it a 20% miss chance against attacks made with metallic weapons (including ammunition), as the invisible forces make targeting unpredictable. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals. Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals. Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

Creatures viewing this burst must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. See the table below for the save DC for each positive energy elemental's blinding flash. The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Throes (Su) A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura). Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt.

A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's positive energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. All creatures in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC as the elemental's positive energy save DC) or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Positive Energy (Ex) A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with positive energy. This deals extra damage to an undead or negative energy based target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) by the same amount. Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature.  • Dominate animal causes a hanshepsu to become confused for 1d4 rounds.  • Hold animal slows a hanshepsu (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds. While slowed, a hanshepsu can't change its animal head with its morphic head ability.  • Soften earth and stone cast directly at a hanshepsu deals 5d10 points of damage (no save).  Morphic Head (Su) As a move action, a hanshepsu can transform its head from one animal form to another. Each animal head grants a hanshepsu different abilities.  Cat: The hanshepsu gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks, and it always counts as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump.  Cobra: The hanshepsu can spit a stream of venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Any opponent hit by this attack succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage for 2 rounds. This is a poison effect.  Crocodile: The hanshepsu's mace grows teeth and deals an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage with each successful attack.

Ibis: The hanshepsu can use feather fall at will as a spell-like ability and can fly for up to 5 minutes each day.  Scarab: The hanshepsu's damage reduction is not subject to the effects of a golembane scarab or any abilities that allow a creature to ignore a construct's damage reduction.  Scorpion: The hanshepsu gains a climb speed of 20 feet and its mace gains the speedUE weapon special ability for 1 minute each day.  Set Beast: The hanshepsu's mace deals an additional 1d6 points of negative energy damage with each successful attack.

Soldier's Training (Ex) A hanshepsu has Weapon Specialization (heavy mace) despite not being a 4th-level fighter.  Warrior's Mace (Su) A hanshepsu's mace is treated as a +1 weapon, and the hanshepsu can deal nonlethal damage with the mace without taking a penalty. The mace is permanently affixed to the hanshepsu's hand during creation so it can't be disarmed; it can, however, be sundered. If the mace is destroyed, a hanshepsu can make 1 slam attack per round that deals 1d8+7 points of damage.

(10 ft. with incorporeal spike)	impale soul	Str -, Dex 16, Con -, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 21	9	12	31	Tome of Horrors 4	Impale Soul (Su) An impaled spirit carries an incorporeal version of the spike that caused its death, a 10-foot long spear-like instrument. On a successful melee attack with this spike, the target must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or have its soul impaled on the ghostly implement. A ghostly duplicate of the impaling instrument and its victim now impaled on the spike appear planted in the ground within 5 feet of the target. A thin silvery cord connects the translucent, impaled creature with its corporeal self. Another thin silvery cord connects the ghostly impalement back to the impaled spirit.  This attack deals 1d6 points of Constitution drain initially and 1 point of Constitution drain each round thereafter until the creature dies or is freed. Each round an impaled victim takes Constitution drain, the impaled spirit connected to it gains 5 temporary hit points. An impaled creature cannot move more than 10 feet from the spot where its soul is impaled, and takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, checks, and saves from the pain until freed.  An impaled creature can be freed if the ghostly spike holding the victim is destroyed or pulled from the ground. The ghostly spike is AC 20, hp 20, hardness 10. Corporeal creatures cannot pull the spike from the ground but can attack it with magic weapons. Normal weapons have no effect. Ethereal creatures can attack the spike with normal weapons or remove it from the ground with a successful DC 21 Strength check. A heal, holy word, wish, or miracle spell destroys the ghostly spike instantly. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Lifesense (Su) An impaled spirit notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of an impaled spirit, unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.

Spell Storing (Su) Once per day as a immediate action, a jungle giant can absorb a targeted or ranged touch spell used against it, negating the effects against it but not against any other targets. It can retain this stored power for up to 1 minute, during which time its tattoos glow with blue fire. If it damages a target with a successful hit using a melee or ranged weapon, it can cast the spell on the target as a free action, as if it were using a spell storing weapon. This spell uses the caster level and DC of the original caster. This discharges the stored spell.  Warding Tattoos (Su) A jungle giant's magical tattoos grant it a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. The giant loses this bonus if it wears armor.

Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 20) or be destroyed.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.																												
Juvenile Bronze Dragon	10.00	9600	Large	1	24, touch 10, flat-footed 23	126	12	9	12				40 ft., fly 200 ft.

Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.  Wave Mastery (Su) For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.																												
Kalavakus	10.00	9600	Medium	1	25, touch 11, flat-footed 24	125	10	8	10		21		30 ft.	bite +16 (1d6+6), 2 claws +16 (1d8+6), gore +16 (2d6+6)		5 ft.	5 ft.	enslave soul, horns, powerful charge (gore, 4d6+12)	Str 22, Dex 13, Con 24, Int 15, Wis 17, Cha 16	10	+16 (+22 disarm)	27	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Enslave Soul (Su) A kalavakus can attempt to enslave the soul of any mortal creature within 60 feet as a swift action. The kalavakus must have line of sight to the target.  The target can resist this special attack with a DC 18 Will save, but is staggered for 1 round even if the save is successful. If the save is successful, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save is a failure, the target's soul is enslaved-this creature takes a -6 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws against that kalavakus. If a creature with an enslaved soul is slain by that kalavakus, the soul immediately infuses the demon's body, affecting it with a heal spell (CL 12th). A kalavakus can have only one mortal soul enslaved at a time-if it enslaves a second soul, the first is released. This is a mind-affecting death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Horns (Ex) The kalavakus's numerous horns can easily catch weapons and yank them away from opponents. The demon gains a +4 racial bonus on all disarm attempts as a result.																												
Kapre	10.00	9600	Huge	2	24, touch 10, flat-footed 22	127	12	9	9				50 ft., climb 30 ft.	2 slams +17 (2d6+12)		15 ft.	15 ft.	blow smoke	Str 26, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 18	11	21	33	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Blow Smoke (Su) Smoke constantly drifts from a kapre's mouth, and as a standard action it can exhale a 30-foot cone of smoke. Any creature in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  Confounding Aura (Su) A magical aura surrounds a kapre, confusing and distracting its foes. Within a kapre's aura, the DC of all Survival checks is increased by 15, and creatures trained in Survival are no longer able to automatically determine true north. On top of this, any creature within a kapre's aura must succeed at a DC 21 Will saving throw when it enters the area or take a -4 penalty on concentration checks, initiative checks, and skill checks. A kapre can suppress this aura at will.  Tree Meld (Su) A kapre can meld with any tree, similar to how the spell meld with stone functions. It can remain melded with a tree as long as it wishes.																												
Kere	10.00	9600	Medium	9	22, touch 15, flat-footed 17	114	8	15	13		21		30 ft., fly 30 ft. (perfect)	2 claws +17 (1d4+3 plus 1d6 cold), shroud +17 (infectious fear)		5 ft.	5 ft. (15 ft. with shroud)	infectious fear (DC 20), veil of tears	Str 16, Dex 21, Con 18, Int 13, Wis 20, Cha 19	12	15	30	AP 64	Grave Dependent (Su) A kere is mystically bonded to a single gravestone-typically the most impressive or oldest in a graveyard-and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. A kere who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded grave immediately becomes visible and unable to use any of her spell-like abilities. A kere who is out of range of her bonded grave for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day of separation that follows-eventually, this separation kills the kere. A kere can break this bond or forge a new bond with a new grave by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 Will save. If a kere is not bonded with a grave, she must either actively try to forge a new bond or attempt to return to the Boneyard (where she takes no penalties from not being bonded).  Grave Meld (Su) A kere can meld with any gravestone or funerary sculpture, similarly to how the spell meld into stone functions. She can remain melded with such a structure as long as she wishes.  Grave Tell (Sp) This ability functions as the spell stone tell, but only affects stone funerary structures, like gravestones, cemetery monuments, lych-gates, mausoleums, and similar constructions.  Infectious Fear (Su) Any creature struck by a kere's shroud must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. Any creature that physically touches a creature frightened by this effect must succeed at a DC 20 Will save as well or also be frightened for 2d4 rounds (though the fear of the creature touched is not contagious). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shroud (Ex) A kere's shroud is an insubstantial thing that only a kere can touch. Creatures that come into contact with this shroud find it to be as insubstantial as mist-though they often do feel the terror it inspires. A creature that is unaware of a kere and is struck by her shroud is not aware that a weapon has struck it. A kere's shroud vaporizes upon its owner's death.  Spiritsense (Su) A psychopomp notices, locates, and can distinguish between living and undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if she possessed the blindsight ability.  Spirit Touch (Ex) A psychopomp's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had the ghost touch weapon special ability.  Veil of Tears (Su) Any graveyard that hosts a kere is gloomier and more solemn. All exterior areas within such a graveyard are perpetually affected by darkness and mind fog (Will DC 20). Additionally, any undead creature that enters the area is also affected as per the spell slow (Will DC 20). Those who save against these effects are immune to the graveyard's veil of tears for the next 24 hours. Those who fail are affected by these penalties for as long as they remain in the graveyard. A veil of tears can be raised or lowered by the resident kere as a free action. The veil disperses if a kere leaves the graveyard or is destroyed, and rises upon her return. The veil can also be dispelled for 1 day by casting dispel magic or a similar spell upon the kere's bonded gravestone. The spell effects are cast at the kere's caster level (usually 11th). The saving throw DCs are based on the resident kere's Charisma.

Constitution Drain (Su) Creatures hit by a lurker wraith's buffet attack must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. On each such successful attack, the lurker wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid slain by either a lurker wraith's Constitution drain or smother attack becomes a ghoul in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are not under the command of the lurker wraith (which typically ignores them), but they do instinctively protect their creator. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast, not a ghoul.  Smother (Ex) When a lurker wraith grapples a target, it continues its Constitution drain each round (though the victim is still allowed a save each round). In addition it forms an airtight seal around its prey. A grappled target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see "Suffocation" in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game).  Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) A lurker wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.																												
Magnetite Golem	10.00	9600	Large	-1	24, touch 8, flat-footed 24	101	4	3	5				20 ft.	2 slams +20 (2d10+8 plus inescapable grip and  magnetic disarm)		10 ft.	10 ft.	inescapable grip, magnetic disarm	Str 27, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 1	13	+22 (+26 grapple)	31	AP 95	Immunity to Magic (Ex) A magnetite golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • Any spell that deals fire damage instead disables a magnetite golem's inescapable grip, magnetic disarm, and magnetic field for 1d4 rounds, with no saving throw.  • A magical attack that deals electricity damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A magnetite golem receives no saving throw against electricity effects.  Inescapable Grip (Ex) Whenever a magnetite golem hits a metallic creature or a creature wearing metal armor with its slam attack, it attempts to grapple the creature as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If a magnetite golem successfully grapples such a creature, it partially adheres to the golem's body, and the golem needs only one arm to maintain the grapple. In these instances, a magnetite golem may still make a single slam attack on its turn with its remaining arm.  Magnetic Disarm (Su) Whenever a magnetite golem hits a creature wielding a metal weapon with its slam attack, it attempts to disarm the weapon as a free action that doesn't  provoke attacks of opportunity. If the golem successfully disarms a metal weapon, the weapon sticks to the golem's magnetic body rather than dropping to the ground. The golem is considered to have possession of the weapon, and the weapon must be retrieved using a disarm combat maneuver.  Magnetic Field (Su) A magnetite golem is surrounded by a magnetic field, which pulls all metallic creatures and objects toward it. At the start of a magnetite golem's turn, as a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, the golem attempts a combat maneuver check against every creature within 30 feet that is connected to a piece of metal. Affected creatures include (but are not limited to) metallic creatures, creatures wearing metal armor, and creatures wielding metal weapons. If the golem succeeds at its combat maneuver against a creature, the affected creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the golem, and can't move away from the golem during its next round. The magnetic field is stronger than gravity, and can pull creatures off the ground. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Large or smaller metal objects automatically travel toward magnetite golem at a rate of 10 feet per round. This magnetism is supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects.

This droning clouds the minds of all creatures within 30 feet that hear it except other helix moths. A successful DC 21 Will save negates the effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, a creature suffers a -4 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, checks and saves for 1 minute. After this time, a new save can be attempted (same DC) if the helix moth's droning can still be heard and the creature is within range. If this save fails, the creature remains affected for another one minute. This continues every minute until a successful save is made or the combat ends. A creature that makes a successful Will save is unaffected by the droning of that helix moth for one day. The droning is a free action so long as the helix moth is airborne. On the ground, it may beat its wings as a move action with the effects as above.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save DC 21; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Strength damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.  The save DC is Constitution-based.

The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid slain by a reaper's death touch is consumed in unholy fire and has its remains destroyed as the destruction spell. This is a death effect.  Sole Target (Su) Each minor reaper is assigned a specific target by the reaper that summoned it. If a creature attacks a minor reaper targeting another creature, that minor reaper may immediately summon another minor reaper as a free action to battle the interceding creature unless the interloper is already in battle with a minor reaper of its own, in which case the ability is wasted. If a minor reaper does not or cannot use this ability immediately after being attacked, it must wait until it is attacked once again in order to do so.

Magically altered terrain affects it normally.  Tongue (Ex) A mobogo's tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times the mobogo's normal reach (45 feet for a typical mobogo). A mobogo does not gain the  grappled condition when using its tongue to grapple a foe.  Vile Croak (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a mobogo can unleash a thunderous croak. Any non-boggard or non-mobogo within 50 feet of the mobogo must make a DC 19 Will save or become staggered for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature makes its saving throw against a particular mobogo's vile croak, it is immune to that mobogo's croak for 24 hours. Any boggards or mobogos within the area of a mobogo's vile croak gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws against fear effects for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

All creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst take 4d8 acid damage (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Scalding Spray (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a myrmecoleon can eject a 60-foot cone of acidic chemicals from its mouth. Creatures caught in the blast take 8d6 points of acid damage and are blinded for 10 minutes (Reflex DC 20 half damage and negates blindness). Following the initial blast, the chemicals vaporize into a thick and noxious cloud 20 feet high with a 40-foot radius. Within the cloud, all sight is obscured beyond 5 feet. Furthermore, any living creature within the area of effect must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become nauseated for as long as it remains in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves the cloud. Any creature that succeeds at its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on the myrmecoleon's turn. This is a poison effect.

Each creature is compelled (Will DC 21 negates) to give an answer within 1 minute (creatures in combat when the sphinx uses this ability gain a +4 bonus on the saving throw). The sphinx gets a +4 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against any creature that refuses to answer (via a successful saving throw), can't answer (including if it's in an area of silence), answers incorrectly, or flees the sphinx instead of answering. The bonuses from failing to solve the riddle last for 24 hours. The need to answer is a compulsion, mind-affecting, language-dependent enchantment effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Sphinx's Curse (Su) A mythic sphinx can expend one use of mythic power when it damages an opponent with a claw attack to curse its opponent with bleeding wounds (Will DC 21 negates). Whenever a cursed target takes piercing or slashing damage, it takes 1d6 points of bleed damage every round for the next 1d6 rounds. This bleed damage stacks with itself and with all other bleed effects. A creature that strikes the killing blow against a mythic sphinx must succeed at a saving throw or become cursed (this requires no uses of mythic power from the sphinx). The save DC is Charisma-based.

It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a non-mythic treant (Bestiary 266). It has only one slam attack, lacks the treant's animation and rock-throwing abilities, and has the treant's vulnerability to fire. If the treant terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state. If the treant expends one use of mythic power when it animates a tree, the tree remains animated and under the treant's control up to a range of 1 mile, and it doesn't count toward the treant's limit of controlling up to two trees at a time.  Double Damage Against Objects (Ex) A mythic treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.  Drink Deep (Su) A mythic treant can expend one use of mythic power to lose its vulnerability to fire for 1 hour.  Treespeech (Ex) A treant has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet it with an attitude of friendly or helpful.  Druidic Magic (Su) A mythic treant can expend one use of mythic power to cast any druid spell of 3rd level or lower, or two uses of mythic power to cast any druid spell of 5th level or lower. Its caster level for this spell is 10th.

Living creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner transforms into a ghoul in 1d4 rounds under the control of the nabasu that created it. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the nabasu dies, any ghouls under its control become free-willed. Plane Shift (Su) Three times per day a nabasu demonling can shift to the Material Plane, and a mature nabasu can shift between the Abyss and the Material Plane or back. This transports the nabasu and up to six other creatures provided they all link hands with the nabasu. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (CL 10th for the demonling and CL 13th for the mature nabasu). Feed (Su) When a nabasu creates a ghoul with its gaze attack, it gains a growth point. It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, caster level checks, and skill checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 10 for each growth point it gains and its caster level increases by 1. For every 2 growth points, its natural armor bonus, SR, and CR increases by +1. Each time it gains a growth point, the nabasu demonling makes a DC 30 caster level check-success indicates it becomes a mature nabasu. At 10 growth points, a demonling automatically becomes a mature nabasu. Paralysis Aura (Su) As a free action, once per day, a mature nabasu can release a paralysis arua in a 10-ft. radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 24 Fort save or be paralyzed for 1d6+4 rounds. Demons are immune to this aura. The save DC is Constitution-based.

If the creature fails a DC 23 Will save, it is immediately fascinated. A nereid may use her suggestion spell-like ability at will against creatures that are fascinated by her beguiling aura. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Drowning Kiss (Su) A nereid can flood the lungs of a willing, helpless, or fascinated creature by touching it (traditionally by kissing the creature on the lips). If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and immediately begins to drown. On its turn, the target can attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save to cough up this water; otherwise it falls unconscious at 0 hp. On the next round, the target must save again or drop to -1 hit points and be dying; on the third round it must save again or die (see page 445 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison (Ex) Touch or spray (range 30 ft.)-contact; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con plus blindness; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Shawl (Ex) A nereid's shawl (hardness 2, hp 6) contains a portion of her life force. If the shawl is ever destroyed, the nereid takes 1d6 points of Constitution drain per hour until she dies. A nereid can craft a new shawl from water by making a DC 25 Will save, but each attempt takes 1d4 hours to complete. Attempts to destroy or steal a nereid's shawl require the sunder or disarm attempts.  Transparency (Su) When underwater, a nereid's body becomes transparent, effectively rendering her invisible. She can become visible or transparent at will as a free action.  Unearthly Grace (Su) A nereid adds her Charisma bonus as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class and CMD if she wears no armor.

This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the efreeti chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Heat (Ex)An noble efreeti's body deals 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples.

Though not truly invisible, they are hard to pinpoint. While using this ability, an observer robot gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and has concealment from creatures more than 5 feet away.  Transmit Senses (Ex) Though observer robot swarms still maintain the ability to transmit their senses to a receiver like a normal observer robot, these rogue robots rarely do so.																												
Pale Stranger	10.00	9600	Medium	9	25, touch 19, flat-footed 19	127	9	10	13	channel resistance +4	21		30 ft.		#ERROR!	5 ft.	5 ft.	pistols, stranger's shot	Str 17, Dex 21, Con -, Int 11, Wis 18, Cha 18	11	14	33	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Pistols (Su) A pale stranger fights with two pistols. A pistol has a range increment of 20 feet and deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage. At a range of up to 20 feet, a pale stranger's pistol attacks resolve as touch attacks. While pistols normally consume bullets and black powder when fired, a pale stranger's pistols supernaturally reload the instant it fires them, allowing the undead to make multiple attacks in a round with the weapons. In addition, any pistol a pale stranger wields functions as a +1 pistol. A pale stranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it fires a pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons for the purposes of determining penalties from two-weapon fighting. Further rules for pistols, and firearms in general, can be found in Ultimate Combat.  Stranger's Luck (Su) A pale stranger gains a +3 luck bonus to AC and has no chance of misfire when using firearms.  Stranger's Shot (Ex) As a full-round action, a pale stranger can take careful aim with one of its firearms and take a single, ruinous shot. This single shot always resolves as a touch attack, regardless of the actual range. If the pale stranger threatens a critical hit with this shot, it automatically confirms the critical hit. Regardless of whether the shot is a critical hit or not, it deals +6d6 points of damage.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Quill Barrage (Ex) Three times per day, a peluda can fire dozens of spearlike barbs in all directions. All creatures within 15 feet take 6d6 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 20 half) and are subject to its poison quills. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Quills (Ex) A peluda's back and tail are covered in sharp black quills. A creature that strikes a peluda with a melee weapon, an unarmed attack, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage from the peluda's quills and risks being poisoned. Weapons with reach do not endanger an attacker in this way. Any creature that grapples a peluda takes 3d6 points of piercing damage and risks being poisoned on its turn each round.  Vulnerable Tail (Su) A peluda is vulnerable to attacks against its tail. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever the peluda's tail (including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage) affects its body. To sever the tail, an opponent must target the tail and attempt a sunder combat maneuver with a slashing weapon. The tail is considered a separate weapon with hardness 5 and hit points equal to the peluda's HD. The opponent must deal enough damage on a single blow to reduce the tail's hit points to 0 or fewer. If the tail is severed, the peluda can no longer attack with it and takes 2d6 points of bleed damage each round.

She also becomes staggered and cannot use any of her spell-like abilities.  Grace (Su) A poludnica adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.  Searing Weapons (Su) Any weapon a poludnica wields becomes incredibly hot and conducts and amplifies her ability to cause fatigue by reducing the target's ability to resist the effects.  In melee combat, such a weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1d2 points of Constitution damage. The Constitution damage is negated with a successful DC 21 Fortitude save. The weapon cools rapidly if it leaves her grasp, losing these additional abilities immediately.  Sunstroke Haze (Su) A poludnica radiates oppressive heat in a 10-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn within this area must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and become fatigued. A fatigued creature that fails a second saving throw becomes exhausted. The fatigued or exhausted condition lasts for as long as the nonlethal damage goes unhealed. A poludnica can activate or suppress this ability as a free action and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Tied to Day (Su) A poludnica's connection to the sun tethers her to the Material Plane. During daylight hours (from dawn to sunset), her abilities are as shown above whether she can actually see the sun or not. During the nighttime hours (from sunset to dawn), a poludnica shifts to the Ethereal Plane (as ethereal jaunt). This is automatic, involuntary, and causes a poludnica great distress. While on the Ethereal Plane, a poludnica is affected by her darkness powerlessness and is nearly helpless. This curse cannot be dispelled or removed by anything short of divine interaction.																												
Raelis	10.00	9600	Large	4	24, touch 14, flat-footed 19	138	9	12	10				50 ft., fly 120 ft. (good)	2 slams +19 (2d8+7 plus stun)		10 ft.	10 ft.		Str 24, Dex 19, Con 20, Int 18, Wis 15, Cha 19	12	+20 (+24 grapple)	34 (36 vs. grapple)	AP 66	Mutable Polymorph (Su) When using spells with the polymorph descriptor, raelises have an uncanny amount of control over their target shape. While they still cannot use the spells to transform into specific individuals, they can control the skin tone, the hair color, the general body shape, and even the gender of the creature they transform into, granting them a +20 bonus on Disguise checks instead of the usual +10. This is a free action made as part of the spellcasting.  Rune Mastery (Ex) Raelises are masters of all magic based on runes or symbols. They automatically add explosive runes, glyph of warding, greater glyph of warding, sepia snake sigil, and all symbol spells to their list of spells known and increase the DC for these spells by 1. Additionally, raelises are immune to magical traps and effects that utilize runes or symbols, such as sepia snake sigil and explosive runes.  Spells A raelis casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. It has no sorcerer bloodline and does not gain any other sorcerer class abilities.  Stun (Ex) A raelis's iron-hard fist delivers a powerful, stunning blow. A creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit and the target fails its save, the creature is instead stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.  Word Caller (Su) Raelises automatically sense the presence and basic topic of any books, scrolls, or other writings within 50 feet. By spending a standard action, they gain a deeper understanding of the text, treating up to 100 pages of nonmagical writing as if they had read it, or treating one magical spell or scroll as if they had read it and successfully made a successful Spellcraft check to understand it.

It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. When a rakshasa uses this ability, it always functions as if it had spent three rounds concentrating and thus gains the maximum amount of information possible. A creature can resist this effect with a DC 18 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

All creatures within 60 feet that hear it must make a successful DC 22 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Panicked creatures suffer a -2 morale penalty on saves and flee (if possible). A panicked creature has a 50% chance to drop what it's holding. If cornered or unable to flee, a panicked creature cowers. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to that red jester's fear cackle for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. Jester's Deck (Su) The red jester uses a deck of playing cards in combat that functions as a deck of many things (Pathfinder RPG core rulebook, 544-555). Once per round, as a standard action, the red jester can draw a single card and throw it at an opponent to a range of 20 feet. This requires a successful ranged touch attack. If successful, the card takes effect that round and affects the target just as if he had drawn a card from a deck of many things. A red jester can draw the same card more than once. The playing cards only function in the hands of a red jester. To anyone else, they are merely normal playing cards. Merriment (Su) If a red jester strikes an opponent with its mace, the creature must make a successful DC 20 Will save or fall to the ground laughing for 1d3 rounds. The opponent is not helpless, but is unable to move or act for the duration. A mace of merriment functions only in the hands of a red jester. In the hands of any other creature it functions as a masterwork light mace. Unassailable Mind (Ex) The mind of a red jester is a twisted and dangerous place to journey. Being undead, it is immune to all mind-influencing effects and should a creature target the mind of a red jester with such an effect (including psionics, telepathy, or the like), the creature attempting to invade the red jester's mind must make a successful DC Will save or suffer the effects of an insanity spell (caster level 15th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

The area within 25 feet of the sacristan is affected by deeper darkness. All creatures within the area are deafened for as long as they remain in the area and must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be confused. The confusion effect lasts for as long as the creature is in the shadow scream's area of effect and for 1d4 rounds after leaving.  Any creature that falls unconscious while under the effects of this confusion effect must succeed at an additional DC 18 Will save or be afflicted by a random insanity-roll on the insanity table on page 250 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide to determine which. A sacristan's shadow scream lasts for 3 rounds and remains centered on the kyton even if it moves. The sacristan can end the shadow scream at will. The scream also ends if the sacristan is killed or is affected by the spell dimensional lock, which prevents this ability's use for as long as the spell in effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an augur's unnerving gaze becomes staggered for 1 round.

A saumen kar's metallic weapons also conduct this chill. A saumen kar's brands can be removed by the spell erase as though they were magic writing with a caster level equal to the saumen kar's Hit Dice. If the brands are removed, the saumen kar loses both its fire resistance and its ability to do additional cold damage, until the following dawn when the brands re-etch themselves upon its body.  Snowstorm (Su) In mimicry of its unforgiving environment, a saumen kar can transform into a living snowstorm of lethal power. This ability lasts as long and operates like the whirlwind special attack with the following changes: Creatures within the area of the snowstorm take 2d6 points of cold damage and 2d6 points of slashing damage and take a -20 penalty on Perception checks. A saumen kar gains a fly speed of 40 feet (perfect) while in this form.  Stun (Ex) While a saumen kar's horns are not large enough for a gore attack, they extend under the skin to form a bony plate. A creature struck by a saumen kar's headbutt must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.																												
Scylla	10.00	9600	Huge	2	21, touch 10, flat-footed 19	138	14	10	18			water dependency	10 ft., swim 50 ft.	6 bites +16 (1d8+6/19-20)		15 ft.	10 ft.	boil water, heat, scalding blast	Str 23, Dex 14, Con 23, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 10	12	+25 (+29 grapple)	47 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Boil Water (Ex) If a scylla uses its heat ability (see below) for 3 consecutive rounds and doesn't move more than 5 feet from its current location, the water surrounding it (in a 10-foot radius and to a depth of 10 feet) begins to rapidly churn and boil. Creatures caught in the boiling water take 3d6 points of fire damage each round they remain in the area. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Creatures wearing heavy clothing or medium or heavy armor take a -2 penalty on their saving throw. In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell. The save DC is Constitution-based. Once the scylla moves from its location or shuts its heat ability off, the boiling water takes 3 rounds to return to its normal temperature (it still deals full damage during its cooling off period). A scylla is immune to its own boil water ability and to the boil water ability of other scyllas. Heat (Ex) A scylla raises the temperature of its body in order to generate intense heat. It does so as a free action. Creatures attacking a scylla unarmed or with natural weapons take 1d6 points of fire damage each time their attacks hit. In addition, a scylla can use its heat ability to boil the surrounding waters. Scalding Blast (Ex) A scylla can gulp some of the boiling water surrounding it as a move action. Each head that gulped water can then unleash a line of scalding steam on the scylla's next action to a range of 50 feet. The scylla can target the same or different opponents with each head, if it wishes. Each blast deals 3d6 points of fire damage or half that amount if the target succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is effective both on the surface and underwater. In any round that a head does not gulp water, it can bite. Water Dependency (Ex) A scylla can survive on land for a number of hours equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hour). After that, refer to the drowning rules in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook.

Any living creature in the area of increased pressure must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area or take 1d8 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Sepia Snake	10.00	9600	Huge	7	21, touch 11, flat-footed 18	114	12	11	5				40 ft., fly 50 ft.

A creature caught in the path can make a successful DC 20 Reflex save to avoid the web. On a failed save, the opponent is wrapped in the snake's webbing. When a foe is completely covered in webbing, it must make a successful DC 20 Fortitude save or be placed in a state of suspended animation as per the sepia snake sigil spell for 1d4+12 days. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  In one round, the sepia snake can spit enough webbing to cover one Medium or smaller creature. For each size category larger than Medium, the snake must fire another line of webbing to completely encase an opponent. Victims hit by the webbing, but not completely covered, can break free in one round by making a successful DC 24 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each 5-foot section of webbing has 10 hit points. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus.  A foe completely wrapped cannot break the webs and must rely on others to get free.  Gaze (Su) The gaze of a sepia snake crushes the will of an opponent and induces despair if it fails a DC 20 Will save. On a failed save, the opponent suffers a -4 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and ability and skill checks. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Tail Sting-Injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect paralysis and 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Shadow Dire Bear	10.00	9600	Large	5	(incorporeal) 13, touch 13, flat-footed 11   (partially corporeal) 18, touch 11, flat-footed 16	90	6	5	9	channel resistance +2, incorporeal			fly 40 ft.

It is not under the control of its killer but attacks all living targets immediately.  Grab (Ex) While partially corporeal, a shadow dire bear that hits with a claw attack can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. The grapple is lost if the shadow dire bear becomes incorporeal again. If the shadow sire bear gains a hold, it automatically deals bite damage each round that the hold is maintained.  Partially Corporeal (Su) As a move action a shadow dire bear can become partially corporeal without provoking attacks of opportunity. It can likewise resume its incorporeal state as a move action without provoking attacks of opportunity. While in its partially corporeal state the shadow dire bear benefits from its natural armor and its Strength bonus for attacks and damage. In this state its attacks have a 20% chance to ignore natural armor, armor, and shields. Likewise, though attacks against it with magic weapons can hit normally, it can ignore damage from attacks with normal weapons from a corporeal source 50% of the time. It does not retain any of the other incorporeal traits while in this state.  Strength Damage (Su) The touch of a shadow dire bear while incorporeal deals 1d6 points of Strength damage to a living creature. This is a negative energy effect. A creature dies if this Strength damage equals or exceeds its actual Strength score.																												
Shield Archon	10.00	9600	Large	5	29, touch 10, flat-footed 28	112	13	7	8		21		40 ft., fly 90 ft.

He cannot transform both hands into shields or both into shortspears. A shield archon never takes the typical -2 penalty on attack rolls while wielding a tower shield. A shield archon's weapons cannot be disarmed, but they can be sundered. If a shield archon loses his spear or shield, he can manifest a new one as a full-round action. When a shield archon is slain, these two items fade away-they cannot be looted or wielded by any other creature.  Stability (Ex) Shield archons receive a +4 racial bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt.  Transpose Ally (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a shield archon can teleport to the location of a willing (or unconscious) ally and immediately teleport that ally to the archon's previous position, in effect switching places with the ally. The archon must have line of effect to the target.																												
Siyokoy	10.00	9600	Medium	5	26, touch 16, flat-footed 20	136	10	9	10			light sensitivity	30 ft., swim 60 ft.	bite +18 (1d6+9/19-20 plus grab), 2 claws +18 (1d6+9), tail slap +14 (1d6+4 plus stunning shock)		5 ft.	5 ft.

When it hits a creature with its tail slap, the attack deals 3d6 points of electrical damage and the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Swim-By Attack (Ex) Extremely quick in the water, a siyokoy gains Spring Attack as a bonus feat when swimming.

The sleeping willow heals 5 points of damage whenever it drains Constitution, gaining temporary hit points (if bonus hit points exceed the sleeping willows total). At Constitution 0, the creature dies and its body is absorbed by the sleeping willow's roots. The save DC is Constitution-based. Sleep Spores (Ex) As a standard action, a sleeping willow can eject a cloud of yellowish pollen from its body in a 30-foot spread. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 19 Will save or fall asleep for 10 minutes. There is no HD limit for this sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Spawn Of Yog-Sothoth	10.00	9600	Large	6	24, touch 11, flat-footed 22	133	9	8	12	tenuous natural invisibility	21		30 ft., climb 30 ft.	bite +17 (1d8+8/19-20/x3), 4 tentacles +16 (1d6+4 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	blood drain (1d4 Con), devastation	Str 26, Dex 15, Con 21, Int 17, Wis 17, Cha 20	10	19	30 (38 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Devastation (Ex) As a full-round action, the spawn can assault a structure, dealing 4d6+16 points of damage to the structure in that round.  Tenuous Natural Invisibility (Ex) This functions like natural invisibility, except it is subject to invisibility purge and effects that outline invisible creatures (such as glitterdust and faerie fire). It cannot be dispelled.																												
Sphinx Stone Idol	10.00	9600	Huge	1	29, touch 9, flat-footed 28	117	4	5	4	rejuvenation			30 ft., fly 50 ft.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone idol (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the stone idol's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.  A disintegrate spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol.  A chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight spell deals 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells.  Rejuvenation (Su) Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in 1d4+2 days.  Site Bound (Ex) A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it is brought back into the area.  Roar (Su) A sphinx stone idol can roar up to three times per day as a standard action. Affected creatures become frightened for 2d6 rounds. A DC 17 Will save negates the effect. The roar is a mind-affecting fear effect and a sonic effect that fills a 100-foot-radius burst, centered on the stone idol sphinx. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same sphinx stone idol's roar for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Spider Lich	10.00	9600	Large	3	19, touch 12, flat-footed 16	102	7	7	10	channel resistance +4			40 ft., climb 40 ft.	bite +11 (2d8+3 plus paralysis and poison)		10 ft.	10 ft.	web (+11 ranged, DC 19, 12 hp)	Str 15, Dex 17, Con -, Int 16, Wis 14, Cha 16	9	12	28 (36 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Fear Aura (Su) Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the spider lich must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become frightened. Creatures with 5 HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for 1d6+6 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same spider lich's aura for one day. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.  Paralyzing Bite (Su) Any living creature a spider lich hits with its bite attack must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6+12 minutes. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a spider lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save DC 21 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6/rounds; effect 1d4 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Rejuvenation (Su) When a spider lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden by the spider lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell) immediately begins to rebuild the undead spider lich's body nearby. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew.  Spells A spider lich does not require any verbal, somatic, or material components to cast its spells.																												
Splinter Drake	10.00	9600	Large	2	23, touch 11, flat-footed 21	178	16	7	8				40 ft.	bite +20 (2d6+8/19-20), 2 claws +19 (1d6+8)	thorn volley +13 (3d6)	10 ft.	5 ft.

The main breath weapon, useable every 1d4 rounds, is a 40-ft. cone that deals 6d6 points of piercing and slashing damage. Its other breath weapon is a volley of thorns spit at a single target as a ranged attack for 3d6 points of piercing damage. Improved Woodland Stride (Su) A splinter drake can move through any sort of undergrowth (natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering other impairment. This includes thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion. Poison (Ex) Three times per day as a free action, a splinter drake can regurgitate its poisonous stomach acids into its mouth and either use it in conjunction with a bite attack or release it along with either version of its breath weapon. The act of regurgitating the poison is a free action. Once it makes a successful bite attack or uses its breath weapon, the poison is used up (though the splinter drake can "reload" again on its next turn if it has any more uses of its poison attack left for the day). Splinter Drake Venom: Bite or breath weapon-injury or contact; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 1 save.																												
Stirge Demon	10.00	9600	Large	3	23, touch 12, flat-footed 20	92	12	9	6		21		20 ft., fly 60 ft.

All creatures within a 60-foot spread that hear it must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or fall into a comatose sleep for 1d4 hours. There is no HD limit for this effect and it otherwise functions as the sleep spell (CL 10th). Note, the stirge demon can drain blood from a sleeping creature without automatically waking it up. In such an event, the sleeping creature receives a new Will save (same DC) each round the stirge demon drains blood. The save DCs are Constitution-based.																												
Sword Spider	10.00	9600	Large	1	25, touch 10, flat-footed 24	112	5	6	5				20 ft., climb 20 ft.	sword-leg +16/+11/+6 (2d6+2/19-20), 3 sword-legs +16 (2d6+2/19-20), bite +16 (1d8+2 plus poison)		10 ft.	10 ft.	sword-legs	Str 14, Dex 12, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	15	18	29 (41 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Immunity to Magic (Ex) A sword spider is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, except as noted: A keen edge spell affects all of a sword spider's sword-leg attacks as if they were slashing weapons.  Transmute metal to wood slows a sword spider for 1d4 rounds (as the slow spell), during which time its damage reduction is negated (no save). A magical attack that deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the sword spider and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the sword spider to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A sword spider gets no saving throw against fire effects. A sword spider is affected normally by rusting attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.  Poison (Ex) A sword spider's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its metal body. Because it is a construct, the sword spider does not naturally produce this poison, and its creator must manually refill this reservoir. The reservoir holds enough poison for 5 successful bite attacks, after which the sword spider deals only bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 1 minute and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir with any injury poison (typically spider venom), though acid, alchemical substances, and even stranger liquids have been used.  Giant Spider Venom: Bite-injury; save DC 14 Fort; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Strength damage; cure 1 save.  Sword-Legs (Ex) A sword spider's legs act as longswords, granting it iterative attacks just as if it wielded multiple weapons. It cannot be disarmed and a sword spider never takes penalties to its attack rolls (for multiweapon fighting) when fighting with its sword-legs.																												
Tentacled Horror	10.00	9600	Huge	0	22, touch 8, flat-footed 22	142	10	7	7	horn	21		30 ft.	4 tentacles +16 (1d8+7/19-20 plus grab), bite +16  (3d6+7)		15 ft.	15 ft.	constrict (1d8+7)	Str 24, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 18	11	+6 (+10 grapple)	17 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Aura of Insanity (Su) Creatures with less than 6 HD that view a tentacled horror must make a DC 23 Will save or be affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 12th). Creatures of 2 HD or less are not only driven mad but are also compelled to worship the tentacled horror as a god (as if affected by a charm person spell, caster level 12th). Only a restoration, greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell can restore the mind of one driven insane by a tentacled horror. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes +2 for its Ability Focus feat.  Horn (Su) The source of a tentacled horror's power is its horn. If a tentacled horror's horn is removed, it loses its regeneration ability and suffers a -6 penalty to Strength and Constitution until the horn is reattached. The horn is AC 20, hardness 10, and has 20 hit points. A tentacled horror's horn cannot be removed unless it is helpless. It takes a successful DC 40 Strength or 10 points of damage to the horn to remove a tentacled horror's horn.

A tarry demodand has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks due to its tarry secretions in addition to that provided by its grab ability. A weapon that strikes a tarry demodand is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. A successful DC 19 Strength check is needed to pry it off. The save DC and check DC are Constitution-based. Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive. A pint of wine or a similar liquid weakens it, but the tarry demodand can still grapple normally. A tarry demodand can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 1 minute after the creature dies. Rage (Ex) A tarry demodand that takes damage in combat has a 50% chance of flying into a berserk rage the following round, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 Strength and -4 AC. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily. While raging, make the following adjustments to the tarry demodand's statistics: AC 23, touch 11, flat-footed 18; CMB +20 (+28 grapple); CMD 35; Melee 2 claws +21 melee (1d6+9), bite +20 melee (1d8+9); Str 28

All damage dealt to a thought harvester with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the thought harvester is immune to critical hits. A thought harvester's force field has fast healing 10, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  Integrated Nanite Injectors (Ex) A thought harvester is outfitted with two nanite injectors. These modified syringes are mounted on the end of animated, flexible tubes that feed into the robot's crystal spheres and allow it to use its harvest thoughts ability. These injectors are treated as a piercing weapons that deal 1d4 points of damage, but can't be salvaged to be used on their own.  Integrated Sonic Rifle (Ex) A thought harvester has an built-in sonic rifle slung beneath its head. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 3d6 points of sonic damage.  The weapon can fire once per round and does so in a burst of shots that attacks all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll against each creature in the line, and each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage can't be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment (such as fog or smoke) or the spells blur, invisibility, or mirror image don't affect this weapon's attack. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately.  Harvest Thoughts (Ex) A thought harvester that hits a living creature with one of its integrated nanite injectors can selectively duplicate certain memories the target possesses. Each time the harvester uses this ability, it can copy one significant event (such as the events of a combat or a birthday party), or it can sift through the victim's memories as part of an interrogation that allows it to effectively ask and receive truthful answers to six questions. A successful DC 17 Will save negates the effects of this ability; mindless creatures or creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 are immune to it. Each time a creature's memories are copied through the use of this ability, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain. A creature's Intelligence score can't be drained below 1 in this way.  If successful, the target's copied memories appear as swirling mist within one of the crystal spheres socketed into the thought harvester's back. If the thought harvester is willing, helpless, or destroyed, a sphere can be removed from its socket with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check and be read by certain devices without damaging the memories within. This ability can be used on creatures that have been dead for less than 24 hours, but their brain must be mostly intact and only 1d4 memories can be harvested postmortem. The duration can be extended if the creature's brain has been preserved (such as by gentle repose) or if the creature possesses a brain that doesn't rot. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.																												
Tiberolith	10.00	9600	Huge	0	24, touch 8, flat-footed 24	111	4	4	5	spell trap	24		30 ft.	2 slams +19 (3d8+8)		15 ft.	15 ft.	corrosive strikes, shockwave	Str 26, Dex 11, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	13	-	-	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Corrosive Strikes (Ex) A tiberolith reduced to 30 or fewer hit points leaks acid, and deals an additional 1d6 points of acid damage with its slam attacks.  Shockwave (Su) Three times per day, a tiberolith can unleash a burst of electricity. This blast deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within 30 feet (Reflex DC 16 half). A tiberolith is immune to its shockwave and that of other tiberoliths. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spell Trap (Su) When a tiberolith is targeted by a spell that allows spell resistance and its spell resistance fails to protect it against that spell, the spell instead becomes trapped in the tiberolith's magical runes. The runes can only trap one spell at a time; if a second spell would become trapped, the first spell affects the tiberolith normally (including allowing a saving throw, if appropriate) and the second spell is trapped. A trapped spell dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours.																												
Tophet	10.00	9600	Large	-1	24, touch 8, flat-footed 24	107	4	3	21				20 ft.	bite +21 (2d6+8 plus grab), 2 slams +21 (1d6+8)		10 ft.	5 ft.	swallow whole (no damage [see below], AC 18, 40 hp), trample (2d6+12, DC 25)	Str 26, Dex 8, Con -, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 1	14	+50 (+54 grapple)	70 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Conductive (Ex) Anytime a tophet is affected by an effect that deals fire damage, determine how much damage the construct would have taken if it were not immune to fire. Creatures currently swallowed whole by the construct take fire damage equal to half of this amount.  Swallow Whole (Ex) Once swallowed by a tophet, an opponent takes no damage, but is trapped inside the creature's hollow interior. The construct's maw locks down, preventing creatures from climbing back out. A creature can attempt to hack or smash its way out as normal, but a tophet's stomach has hit points equal to one-tenth its actual hit points plus its bonus hit  points for being a construct (totalling 40 hit points for most tophets). Alternatively, a swallowed creature can attempt to pick the lock on the iron hatch in the tophet's stomach by making a DC 30 Disable Device check. If a creature exits by picking the lock, the tophet closes its hatch and can swallow whole again. These locks can also be picked from the outside, but only after the tophet is slain. A Large tophet's belly can hold 1 Medium creature at a time.																												
Trench Mist	10.00	9600	Gargantuan	9	12, touch 12, flat-footed 6	112	8	10	+3 (+2 vs. fear)	amorphous, negative energy affinity			0 ft., fly 40 ft. (perfect)	touch +7 (4d6 acid plus 4d6 negative energy)		20 ft.	10 ft.	create trench zombie, engulfing mists	Str -, Dex 20, Con 16, Int 7, Wis 13, Cha 10	11	9	24	AP 71	Create Trench Zombie (Su) A trench mist can animate any corporeal creature slain while engulfed within its form. The victim rises as a trench zombie (see facing page) in 1d4 rounds and is under the control of the trench mist that created it. A trench zombie becomes free-willed if it is separated from its parent trench mist. A trench mist can animate a number of trench zombies whose Hit Dice total does not exceed more than twice its own Hit Dice.  Engulfing Mists (Ex) A trench mist can engulf foes (see the engulf special ability on page 296 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2). A creature engulfed by a trench mist does not gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it automatically takes 4d6 points of acid damage and 4d6 points of negative energy damage. A trench mist's vapors obscure all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate targets). The save DC to avoid the engulfing mists is Constitution-based.  Gaseous (Ex) A trench mist has a body composed of foul, mustard-colored vapors. This form grants the amorphous defensive ability and allows it to pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with no reduction to its speed, but it cannot enter water or other liquids. A trench mist doesn't have a Strength score. It can't manipulate or wear objects, and it is treated as a creature three size categories smaller than its actual size (Medium for most trench mists) for the purposes of how wind affects it.  Trench Zombie Symbiosis (Su) Because of its symbiotic relationship with the trench zombies it creates, a trench mist shares senses with its animated creatures when they are engulfed within its form, granting them lifesense and making them immune to the concealment the trench mist grants to creatures within and outside of its foggy form.																												
Uniila	10.00	9600	Medium	6	22, touch 22, flat-footed 15	95	11	15	7		21		fly 40 ft. (perfect)	4 +1 daggers +17 (1d4+1/19-20)	4 +1 daggers +17 (1d4+1/19-20)	5 ft.	5 ft.	dread magic	Str 11, Dex 22, Con 19, Int 22, Wis 18, Cha 21	10	10	32	AP 28	Dread Magic (Su) All spells an uniila casts draw upon terrible infernal eddies and the torment of damned souls. As such, all of an uniila's spells (not her spell-like abilities) are strange and terrible to behold. This increases the Spellcraft DC required to identify an uniila's spell as it is being cast by +5. In addition, at will, an uniila can choose to make a spell she casts particularly frightening. Any creature forced to make a saving throw to resist a spell cast by an uniila must make an additional Will save at the same DC or be shaken for 1 round. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Infernal Arcana (Su) Once per day, after spending a minute whispering strange formulas and cosmic truths, an uniila can grant an adjacent mortal spellcaster additional profane insight into the ways of magic. This counts as a bonus spell prepared or spell per day of 6th level or lower, which is immediately accessible by the target in addition to all its regular spells. The uniila chooses what spell to grant the target. It need not be a spell already known by the target, though it must be of 6th level or lower and of a level he can cast or from his class's spell list. This spell remains available to the target for 24 hours. The spell can be any arcane or divine spell. An uniila can never use this ability on herself or non-mortal targets. Once a target chooses to make use of this spell, it is cast at the uniila's caster level (typically 8th) and is treated as having the evil subtype. In addition, as the uniila chooses, she may spontaneously add the effects of any metamagic feat to the spell (without the spell being treated as though it were of an increased spell level). Typically, uniilas use this ability to compel magic users to rely on them for more powerful magic, though they might also use effects like Widen Spell to affect unintended targets. Scroll Mastery (Su) All uniilas possess Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. An uniila is treated as knowing all spells of 6th level or lower in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and can create scrolls of any of those spells. Whether an uniila knows rarer magic is decided by the GM. Summon Devil (Su) Once per day, an uniila can attempt to summon 2d4 imps with a 55% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell. Witch Token (Su) By spending an hour in concentration, an uniila can create a token of arcane power. This token may take any form that takes up an item slot, and typically appears as a subtly fiendish ring, amulet, or similar piece of jewelry. While it is worn by a mortal, all of the DCs of any spells the wearer casts increase by +1 (this effect stacks with Spell Focus). However, while wearing a witch token, the bearer takes a -5 penalty on all saves made to resist spells and effects cast by the token's creation. Also, while the token is being worn, the uniila can effectively scry through the token at will and without the wearer's knowledge as long as he remains on the same plane. Spells and effects that typically bar or confound scry also affect the witch token. As a standard action, an uniila can cause her witch token to erupt in a burst of destructive magic that deals 10d6 points of damage to the wearer. An uniila can only ever have one witch token in existence at a time and must destroy a previously created token before creating a new one. The damage of this effect is based on the uniila's Hit Dice. All witch tokens are also under effects similar to magic aura, and are detected as possessing auras of moderate universal magic. Those who use identify or a similar spell must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to receive correct information (that the token sheds an aura of strong divination). Detect evil reveals no aura from a witch token. The saving throw is Charisma-based.																												
Ursikka	10.00	9600	Huge	4	24, touch 8, flat-footed 24	138	14	10	5	ferocity			40 ft., burrow 20 ft.	bite +21 (2d6+11 plus freezing viscosity), 2 claws +21 (1d8+11)		15 ft.	15 ft.	coat claws, spit	Str 32, Dex 11, Con 22, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 5	12	+25 (+27 bull rush)	35 (37 vs. bull rush, 39 vs. trip)	AP 70	Coat Claws (Ex) As a standard action, an ursikka can coat its pincerlike claws with its freezing viscous saliva. This coating lasts for 1 minute. Any creature hit by an ursikka's coated claws or grappled by an ursikka using the Snatch feat takes an additional 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 22 half).  Freezing Viscosity (Ex) The saliva that drips from an ursikka's mouth is maddeningly sticky as well as preternaturally cold. Creatures that take damage from an ursikka's bite attack must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or become entangled for 1d4 rounds. While entangled, creatures take 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 22 half). An entangled creature can break free before the end of this duration by succeeding at a DC 19 Strength check or by dealing 15 point of damage to the encasing saliva with either a slashing weapon or with fire damage. Using fire to remove the saliva damages the entangled creature as well. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Hibernation (Ex) Ursikkas can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time, typically until Triaxus's long summer subsides. An ursikka surrounds itself with its spittle, which hardens into a cocoon. While hibernating, an ursikka doesn't need to drink or eat. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 60 hit points, and is immune to fire damage. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the ursikka remains unharmed in its hibernation. An ursikka must use its attacks to break free from its cocoon.  Spit (Ex) As a standard action, an ursikka can spit a 60-foot line of its saliva. Creatures struck by this saliva take 8d6 points of cold damage and risk being entangled. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled condition. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Vrykolakas	10.00	9600	Medium	8	23, touch 15, flat-footed 18	115	9	9	11	channel resistance +4		vulnerability to fire	40 ft., climb 20 ft.	2 claws +13 (1d6+6 plus energy drain), bite +13 (1d6+6)		5 ft.	5 ft.	horrid visage, energy drain (1 level, DC 21), rend (2 claws, 1d6+9)	Str 22, Dex 19, Con -, Int 7, Wis 18, Cha 23	7	13	28	AP 29	Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by a vrykolakas's natural attacks becomes a vrykolakas itself in 1d4 days if not blessed and properly buried. A blessing might entail either the spell bless or a more mundane consecration. A vrykolakas's spawn are free-willed and wild, typically remembering nothing of their moment of death and caring nothing for the vrykolakas that killed them. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Feral Possession (Ex) Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a vrykolakas's spirit attempts to possess any animal within 100 feet. This ability is similar to the spell magic jar but does not require a receptacle and has a duration equal to 1 hour for every Hit Die the vrykolakas possesses. The target must make a DC 21 Will save or be possessed. If the possession fails, the vrykolakas immediately dies. If the possession succeeds, the animal immediately retreats to the vrykolakas's grave, where it attempts to bury itself in the earth. If left uninterrupted for 1d4 days, the animal transforms into a new vrykolakas with all the same statistics as the original. If discovered and slain during this time, both the animal and the vrykolakas spirit are destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based. Pestilent Aura (Su) All creatures that come within 5 feet of a vrykolakas must save to resist contracting bubonic plague. Any creature that successfully saves against a vrykolakas's pestilent aura cannot be affected by the aura of that same vrykolakas for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Bubonic Plague: aura-inhaled; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage and 1 Cha damage and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.																												
Water Orm	10.00	9600	Huge	7	24, touch 11, flat-footed 21	136	13	13	7	elusive			20 ft., swim 50 ft.	bite +19 (4d6+8/19-20 plus grab), tail slap +14 (2d8+4)		15 ft.	15 ft.

As a full-round action while in water, a water orm can move up to its run speed (200 ft.) without leaving any trace of its passage (identical in effect to pass without trace). An elusive water orm gains a +40 circumstance bonus to its Stealth check. In addition, when not in combat, a water orm is considered to be under the effects of a nondetection spell. These effects function at caster level 20th and cannot be dispelled.  Water Travel (Su) As a full-round action once per day, a water orm can dissolve into water, appearing only as a long, dark, serpentine stretch of water that looks similar to the passage of a school of fish when viewed from above the water. While in this form, the water orm swims at a speed of 600 feet per round (60 mph) and gains a +40 bonus on all Swim checks. It cannot attack or take any action other than swimming in this form, and can remain in this form for up to 8 hours at a time. A water orm can revert to its solid form from this state as a free action. Water orms are unable to pass into or through salt water when using this ability.

The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sail0r) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the whale's size, the whale takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.

Weapons with damaging parts that are primarily metal (or some other material) such as arrows, spears, and so on, damage a woodwose normally.  Plant Passivism (Ex) No plant creatures willingly attack a woodwose. They can be forced to do so through magical means however. If attacked by a woodwose or one of its allies, the effect is broken and the plant creature can attack the woodwose normally.  Plantsense (Ex) A woodwose can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with vegetation.  Spells A woodwose casts spells as a 9th-level druid.  Spines (Ex) As a free action, a woodwose can cause sharpened wooden spines to protrude from its body. Any creature in contact with the woodwose or grappling with it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage each round it remains in contact with the woodwose. In addition, any creature attacking a woodwose with natural weapons or unarmed attacks takes the same 1d6 points of damage.

This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals. Swamp Stride (Ex) A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. Water Breathing (Ex) A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

This functions as gust of wind, but any creature in its path must make a Fortitude save (DC 20) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand.  Move Sand (Su) A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell.  Sleep Breath (Su) Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a 40 ft. cone of sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+5 rounds.

Destructive Crush (Su) When an old or older forest dragon makes a crush attack, the impact kicks up debris in a 20-foot-radius burst for 1d6 rounds. The debris obscures the vision of creatures within the debris field and grants concealment to those creatures. The forest dragon can see normally within and through the debris field.  Elemental Breath (Su) Once per day, when an ancient or older forest dragon uses its breath weapon, it can summon a greater earth elemental within the cone. The caster level for these effects is the same as the dragon's caster level.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older forest dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against the listener's Sense Motive check.  Stony Death (Su) Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by a great wyrm forest dragon's breath weapon must also make a Fortitude save (same DC as the forest dragon's breath weapon) or be petrified as the flesh to stone spell. This is a death effect.  Woodland Stride (Ex) As the druid ability of the same name.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Incinerate (Su) A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures in its fiery breath. A creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by its breath weapon must make a Fortitude save (using the breath weapon's DC). Failure indicates that the creature is reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only be restored to life through true resurrection or similar magic. Manipulate Flames (Su) An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires. Melt Stone (Su) An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage. Smoke Vision (Ex) A very young red dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics). Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A red dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.

Cloudwalking (Su) A very young or older silver dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground. Cold Aura (Su) An old or older silver dragon is surrounded by an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's aura damage increases to 2d6. A silver dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action. Fog Vision (Ex) A juvenile or older silver dragon can see perfectly well in fog and clouds. Graceful Flight (Ex) A young or older silver dragon's aerial maneuverability is one step better than normal. Paralyzing Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of cold, a silver dragon can breathe a cone of paralyzing gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon. Reflective Scales (Su) Any spell that targets an ancient or older silver dragon but fails to penetrate the silver dragon's spell resistance might be reflected. If the caster level check to penetrate the dragon's spell resistance is failed by 5 or more, the spell is reflected. If the check fails by 4 or less, the spell is merely wasted. This otherwise functions as spell turning. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A silver dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Very young-detect evil; Juvenile-feather fall; Adult-fog cloud; Old-control winds; Ancient-control weather; Great wyrm-reverse gravity. True Courage (Ex) A great wyrm silver dragon can fight on through pain and death. When reduced to below 0 hit points, it remains conscious, automatically stabilizes, and can continue to act (although it is staggered). If it takes damage or is the target of a spell that causes its death, it remains alive for 1 round and can act normally (it is not staggered for this final round).

Alien Presence (Su) A vortex dragon's alien presence bends space. A creature that fails its saving throw treats all other creatures as if they were under the effects of blur (or displacement if the target has 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6 rounds.  Collapsing Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of fire, an ancient or older vortex dragon can suck a single target into its maw.

This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per age category of the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon's breath weapon (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the total damage dice of the pool is halved until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface. Acidic Bite (Su) At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6.

The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence.

The save DC for this effect is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Fire Aura (Su) An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient brass dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A brass dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action. Move Sand (Sp) A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell. Sandstorm (Su) An ancient or older brass dragon can create a powerful sandstorm once per day as a full-round action. This storm has a radius of 1 mile and lasts for 1 minute per age category of the dragon. This functions as a sandstorm (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431), except that it is also accompanied by windstorm-level winds.

Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger the ship is than the brine dragon's size, the dragon takes a cumulative -10 penalty on the check.  Desiccating Bite (Su) An ancient brine dragon's bite causes weakness, dealing 1d2 points of Strength drain in addition to its normal damage. A great wyrm's bite deals 1d4 points of Strength drain. A Fortitude save (DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC) negates the Strength drain.  Painful Strikes (Su) A great wyrm brine dragon's natural attacks are so laden with salt and acidic crystals that every time it strikes a creature with one of these attacks, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC) or be stunned for a round from the pain.

When a cloud dragon uses its breath weapon, make a single bull rush attack using the dragon's CMB against the CMD of any creature that failed its Reflex save and is three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. This bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the dragon cannot choose to move with any opponent pushed back. In addition to being pushed back, affected creatures are knocked prone and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back. Flying creatures are buffeted and pushed back twice the distance and sustain 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back.

An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. Breath Weapon (Su) A mist dragon's breath weapon is a cone of cloudy scalding vapor. In still air, the vapor lingers for 1d4 rounds and forms a cloud that covers a radius equal to the cone's length; on the second round, the vapor condenses into a heated smothering fog that deals 1d6 points of fire damage to creatures each round they remain in the area (Fortitude save halves this damage). The fog also blinds creatures (as the blindness spell) that fail the save as long as they remain within in the cloud and for 2 rounds after they leave the area. Mist Form (Su) As a standard action, a juvenile or older mist dragon can assume gaseous form, but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. A great wyrm mist dragon's abilities while in mist form improve drastically. As a standard action a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can make a single melee attack of its choice at its highest attack bonus. This attack deals normal damage. As a full-round action, a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can attack with its breath weapon. Mist Vision (Ex) A very young mist dragon can see perfectly in foggy conditions (such as those created by fog cloud or obscuring mist).

Once the caster returns or the aerial servant enters the plane the caster is on, the link is immediately reconnected and the aerial servant moves at the full speed toward the casters current location. Only when the aerial servant or caster is destroyed is the link permanently broken. Natural Invisibility (Su)  This ability is constant, allowing the aerial servant to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and is not subject to the invisibility purge  spell. This ability does not function on the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but instead grants the creature concealment (20% miss) chance. Wind Blast (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, an aerial servant can release a blast of wind in an 80-foot line. A creature struck takes 4d8 points of damage, and creatures up to the aerial servant's size or smaller are knocked knocked back 2d10 feet and prone.

Oversized Weapon (Ex) An ash giant can wield Huge weapons without penalty.  Vermin Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save that it works only on vermin. An ash giant uses its Hit Dice (normally 14) as its effective druid level. Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the ash giant to train vermin and use them as guardians (although it does not grant them skills or feats).

While making a full attack, an atamahuta controls its arms with both heads and does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with a double weapon.  Spellstrike (Su) An atamahuta can imbue its weapon with magical properties using its spell-like abilities. Whenever an atamahuta casts a spell with a range of "touch" from its spell-like abilities, it can deliver the spell through any weapon it is holding as part of a free melee attack at its highest base attack bonus as part of casting its spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. This attack uses the weapon's critical multiplier (usually x3), but the spell effect only deals 2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier. An atamahuta cannot make a full attack during the same round that it uses a spell-like ability unless another effect would allow it to do so.  Ward Off Distractions (Ex) An atamahuta uses one of its heads to defend against attacks while the other is using a spell-like ability, giving it a +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity while casting.

Melee weapons with reach do not endanger a user in this way. Fear (Su) A barbed devil's fear attack affects any creature it damages with its claws. A DC 20 Will save resists this effect, otherwise the victim becomes frightened for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Grab (Ex) A barbed devil can use its grab attack against a foe of up to Medium size. Impale (Ex) A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.

The target takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage (Fort DC 23 half). The bhuta heals 5 hit points when it drains blood.  Cold Iron Weakness (Su) A cold iron weapon is considered to be magical when used against a bhuta. A magic cold iron weapon always functions as a ghost touch weapon when used against a bhuta.																												
Bronze Giant	11.00	12800	Huge	1	23, touch 9, flat-footed 22	152	15	8	10	rock catching			40 ft.	longsword +21/+16/+11 (3d6+11) or 2 slams +21  (2d6+11)	spear +11 (3d6+11) or rock +12 (2d6+16)	15 ft.	15 ft.	rock throwing (140 ft.), sardonic laugh	Str 33, Dex 13, Con 21, Int 10, Wis 16, Cha 14	12	25	36	Tome of Horrors Complete	Sardonic Laugh (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a bronze giant can unleash a bellowing laugh that strikes fear into the hearts of any creature within 100 feet that hears it. Affected creatures that succeed on a DC 20 Will save are unaffected and immune to the sardonic laugh of that bronze giant for 24 hours. On a failed save, that creature is shaken for as long as it remains within 100 feet of the bronze giant and for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Bronze Minotaur	11.00	12800	Large	-1	26, touch 8, flat-footed 26	107	4	3	4				20 ft.	large greataxe +23/+18/+13 (3d6+13/x3)		10 ft.	10 ft.	breathe fire (4d6, DC 17)	Str 28, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	14	24	33	Tome of Horrors 4	Immunity to Magic (Ex) A bronze minotaur is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a bronze minotaur (as the slow spell) for three rounds with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the bronze minotaur and heals one point of damage for every three points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the bronze minotaur to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A bronze minotaur gets no saving throw against fire attacks.  Breath Fire (Su) A bronze minotaur can breathe fire as a free action on the first round of combat and every other round thereafter. A bronze minotaur's fiery breath shoots from its mouth in a 30 foot cone inflicting 4d6 damage. A DC 17 Reflex save can reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution based.																												
Capacitor Ooze	11.00	12800	Medium	-5	5, touch 5, flat-footed 5	195	12	0	0	electrified			10 ft., climb 10 ft.	slam +18 (2d6+9 plus 4d6 electricity and neurophagic jolt)		5 ft.	5 ft.	neurophagic jolt	Str 22, Dex 1, Con 24, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	12	18	23	Numeria Land Of Fallen Stars	Electrified (Ex) A creature that strikes a capacitor ooze with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or metal weapon takes 4d6 points of electricity damage. Creatures grappling a capacitor ooze take this damage when initiating the grapple and on each round the grapple is maintained. Neurophagic Jolt (Ex) When a capacitor ooze deals electricity damage to a target with its slam attack, the jolt to the target's neurological system stuns the creature for 1 round (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A second neurophagic jolt to a stunned target sets up a destructive resonance in the target's brain. This resonance functions like an affliction with the following statistics: save Will DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity and 1d2 Intelligence damage; cure 1 save. Neutralize poison does not cure this affliction, but heal, greater restoration, and any effect that removes insanity does. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Osmotic Drain (Ex) A capacitor ooze drains power from nearby electrical sources. Any creatures within 10 feet of a capacitor ooze carrying at least one device that's powered by or generates electricity must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or lose 1 charge from a random electrical device. Singleuse items are depowered entirely; devices with renewable electrical sources are depowered until they can recharge (in the case of a solar-powered device) or have their electrical function suppressed for 1d4 minutes (in the case of a shock weapon). A given power source can be drained only once per minute. For each electrical device affected by the capacitor ooze's osmotic drain, the ooze deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage the next time it would deal electricity damage to a target, and its speed increases by 30 feet for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A successful critical hit from such attacks causes the carnivorous crystal to split, even if the attack causes no damage. The crystal remains immune to precision-based damage, such as damage from sneak attacks.  Crystallize (Ex) A creature entrapped by a carnivorous crystal's attack must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save each round or become helpless. If a helpless creature fails this save, it becomes petrified as its body crystallizes. In 1d4 hours, the petrified victim shatters and a new carnivorous crystal emerges from the remains. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Razor Sharp (Ex) A carnivorous crystal's slam attack deals devastating piercing and slashing damage, and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.  Subsonic Hum (Su) An active carnivorous crystal gives off supernatural sonic vibrations. Any living creature starting its turn within this aura must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same carnivorous crystal's subsonic hum for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

In addition the fire damage from the bite attack increases from 1d6 on the first round to 3d6 points of damage on the third round. As the char shambler makes this attack it slowly begins charring its opponent. If it kills an opponent in this manner, the victim's flesh and tissues are completely charred away while the char shambler inhales the resulting smoke for its sustenance. It then devours the scorched and crumbling bones in 1d4 rounds.  Desecrating Aura (Su) Through the sheer foulness of its presence, a char shambler emits an aura within a 20- foot radius similar in effect to the secondary function of a desecrate spell (i.e. cutting off an area's connection to a non-associated deity and countering consecrate). This effect does not offer any bonuses to undead within the radius. Furthermore, it counters and dispels spells with the good descriptor within its area as if it was casting dispel magic as a 5th-level wizard.  Smoke Cloud (Ex) In addition to its stench, a char shambler continually gives off a cloud of acrid smoke from its scorched flesh. This cloud likewise affects all within 10 feet of the char shambler. The smoke provides concealment (20% miss chance) to those within the cloud and they must make a Fortitude save each round (DC 24, +1 per previous check) or spend that round coughing and choking. This is saving throw in addition to the sickening effects of the char shambler's stench. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus from its Ability Focus feat. A char shambler is immune to the effects of smoke (its own or otherwise) and ignores the concealment it provides as well.

The ability is otherwise identical to ethereal jaunt (CL 15th) except it accesses the Astral Plane. Astralsense (Su) A corpsespinner can automatically detect the location of anything within 200 feet of it on the Astral Plane. Create Corpsespun (Su) Creatures slain by a corpsespinner but not devoured rise in 1 hour as a corpsespun creature (see Templates appendix). Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 2d6 Intelligence damage, death at 0 Intelligence and rise as a corpsespun after 1 hour; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Web (Ex) As the standard ability but with range 80 ft. In addition the checks include both a +4 bonus because the webs are constructed of astral material and a +4 racial bonus. The corpsespinner cannot produce the magical astral webs during combat.

If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the crag giant takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the crag giant is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)  Stonecunning (Ex) This ability functions as the dwarf's stonecunning ability.																												
Crucifixion Spirit	11.00	12800	Medium	7	19, touch 19, flat-footed 15	142	10	10	15	incorporeal	22		fly 50 ft.

This requires the crucifixion spirit to succeed at a ranged touch attack.  If successful, the target's soul is ripped from its body, which collapses in a heap on the ground. The target's soul appears as a translucent copy of the victim and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed, crucified in midair to a translucent, "X" shaped structure, the soul held in place by translucent spikes or nails. The victim is not dead and is visible to all those viewing it.  A crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative levels to it in the round it is crucified, and one negative level each round thereafter. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 22. The save DCs are Charisma-based. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability for it to continue to affect a target.  It can direct attacks against a different opponent. A crucified creature can attempt to escape each round by making a DC 22 Will save. If successful, the creature's soul is freed from its torment and returns to its body in the same round. The target is stunned for one round, but afterwards can act normally.  A creature slain with this ability cannot be returned to life except through the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell. Even then, there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the check fails, the creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.  Immune Channel Energy (Ex) A crucifixion spirit takes no damage from the channel energy ability, and is not affected by effects that mimic channel energy or are based on the channel energy ability (such as turn undead and command undead).

Creatures thrown in this way take 3d6 points of damage as if they had fallen from the same distance.  Rending Mandibles (Ex) If a deadly mantis hits with both claws and successfully grabs a foe, it can make an immediate bite attack against that foe as a secondary attack. This bite attack has a +12 attack bonus and deals 4d6+6 points of damage. In addition to dealing damage, the mantis can tear away the victim's armor as a free action by making a combat maneuver check. If the mantis is successful, the target's armor is ripped from its body. If the target fails a DC 31 Reflex save, the armor subjected to this attack loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. The save DC is Strength-based.

(perfect)	2 claws +18 (1d8+9 plus energy drain)		10 ft.	10 ft.	devour soul, energy drain (1 level, DC 20)	Str 28, Dex 16, Con -, Int 19, Wis 16, Cha 21	10	-	-	PFRPG Bestiary	Devour Soul (Su) By making a touch attack as a standard action, a devourer can deal 12d6+18 points of damage as if using a slay living spell. A DC 22 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the devourer's chest. The creature cannot be brought back to life until the devourer's destruction (or a spell deflection-see below) releases its soul. A devourer can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides a devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer must expend essence points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell's level (for sake of ease, spell levels for its spell-like abilities are included in its stats to the left in superscript). At the start of an encounter, a devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. The trapped essence gains one permanent negative level for every 5 points of essence drained-these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle or wish. The save DC is Charisma-based. Spell Deflection (Su) If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they instead affect a devoured soul: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected-success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.

This deals 2d8 points of piercing damage, and the grappled foe is subject to the dorvae's supernatural poison.  Dorvae Poison (Su) Writhing snakes-injury; save DC 20; frequency 1/round for 12 rounds; effect 1d4 Wis and on the first failed save the target is susceptible to the dorvae's lesser geas no matter its Hit Dice for 24 hours. Cure 3 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Earth Mastery (Ex) An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.

Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds.

Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A control water spell cast on an area containing a burrowing ice elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the elemental climbs must be icy. The elemental can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Numbing Cold (Su) When an ice elemental deals cold damage to a creature, that creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is listed in the elemental's stat block and is Constitution-based. Snow Vision (Ex) An ice elemental can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

Spark Leap (Ex) A lightning elemental gains a +10 bonus on bull rush, disarm, overrun, and trip attacks when it charges a creature against whom its metal mastery ability applies.																												
Elder Magma Elemental	11.00	12800	Huge	3	25, touch 7, flat-footed 25	152	14	9	5			vulnerable to cold	20 ft., burrow 20 ft.	2 slams +22 (3d6+8 plus burn)		15 ft.	15 ft.	burn (3d6, DC 20), lava puddle	Str 26, Dex 8, Con 19, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 11	16	26	35	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Burn (Ex) A magma elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn quite as hot as true elemental flames.  Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.  Lava Puddle (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a puddle of lava (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) that fills its space to a depth of 2-3 inches and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round. The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after a number of rounds equal to the elemental's Hit Dice. At the GM's discretion, this puddle of lava could start secondary fires.																												
Elder Mud Elemental	11.00	12800	Huge	5	23, touch 14, flat-footed 17	152	14	17	5				20 ft., burrow 10 ft., swim 30 ft.	2 slams +24 (2d10+10/19-20 plus entrap)		15 ft.	15 ft.	entrap (DC 22, 10 minutes, hardness 10, hp 15)	Str 30, Dex 20, Con 19, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 11	16	28	44	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing mud elemental can pass through dirt, gravel, or other loose or porous solid matter as easily as a fish swims through water. It cannot use this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.  Entrap (Ex) The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3 rounds of immersion in water.																												
Elder Smoke Elemental	11.00	12800	Huge	14	27, touch 19, flat-footed 16	152	14	20	5	air mastery, amorphous		vulnerability to cold, vulnerability to wind	fly 80 ft.

Burn (Ex) A smoke elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn as hot as a true fire elemental's flames.  Engulf (Ex) A smoke elemental can engulf creatures of its size or smaller into its smoky form as part of a standard action. It cannot make any other attack in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that are not adjacent to them.  Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Gaseous (Ex) A smoke elemental can pass through small holes or narrow openings without reducing its speed.  Vulnerability to Wind (Ex) A smoke elemental is treated as two sizes smaller for purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.																												
Elder Water Elemental	11.00	12800	Huge	6	24, touch 15, flat-footed 17	152	14	18	5				20 ft., swim 90 ft.	2 slams +24 (2d10+10/19-20)		15 ft.	15 ft.	drench, vortex (DC 28), water mastery	Str 30, Dex 22, Con 19, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 11	16	28	45	PFRPG Bestiary	Drench (Ex) The elemental's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental's HD). Vortex (Su) A water elemental can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (see page 306), but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water. Water Mastery (Ex) A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.																												
Erodaemon	11.00	12800	Medium	9	25, touch 16, flat-footed 19	147	9	14	12		22		30 ft.	bite +19 (1d6+4 plus 1d4 Charisma drain), 2 claws +19 (1d6+4)		5 ft.	5 ft.	object of desire, wilting kiss	Str 18, Dex 21, Con 21, Int 19, Wis 16, Cha 22	14	19	34	Horsemen Of The Apocalypse	Object of Desire (Su) While using its detect thoughts ability, an erodaemon can see into the mind of a humanoid and identify the person the target most desires, whether it be a lost loved one or an object of lust. As a full-round action, the erodaemon can change into the form of this desired person as long as the target is a Small, Medium, or Large humanoid. The erodaemon gains a +20 bonus on its Disguise and Bluff checks to impersonate that person and avoid being detected as a fraud, but spells like true seeing negate this effect as normal. This effect ends if the erodaemon attacks any creature. Actions that could reveal the erodaemon as a fraud (such as performing an action that the imitated person would obviously not do, like cast a spell or speak Infernal) require the erodaemon to make an immediate Bluff check to continue the impersonation, with the erodaemon losing some or all of its bonus depending on the severity of the breach (GM's discretion).  Wilting Kiss (Su) An erodaemon can draw a mortal into a state of obsession with its kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before the erodaemon can use this ability. A creature affected by this kiss must make a DC 23 Will save or become obsessed with the erodaemon, an obsession the erodaemon feeds on. Each round the target is more than 30 feet away from the erodaemon, it must make an additional DC 23 Will save. Failing the save means that the sheer pain of her absence deals 1 point of Charisma drain to the subject that round. Succeeding at the Will save two consecutive times ends the effects of this ability. Spells such as dispel magic and break enchantment end this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Flayer Devil	11.00	12800	Large	2	27, touch 11, flat-footed 25	174	13	10	10		22		40 ft.	2 claws +21 (1d8+9/19-20), bite +21 (2d6+9)		10 ft.	10 ft.	flensing, unholy burst	Str 29, Dex 15, Con 29, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 14	12	22	34	Tome of Horrors Complete	Unholy Burst (Su) Three times per day, a flayer devil can release a burst of hellish black vapor in a 30-foot radius.  Those caught within the area must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. Additionally, good-aligned creatures suffer 3d6 points of unholy damage from the vapors if they fail their save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Flensing (Ex) A flayer devil that scores a critical hit with a claw attack rips the flesh from its opponent's body. This attack deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage.																												
Gargantuan Monstrous Sea Wasp	11.00	3200	Gargantuan	1	17, touch 7, flat-footed 16	104	12	6	5	transparent			swim 60 ft.	tentacle +13 (2d6+7 plus poison)		20 ft.	15 ft.	entangle	Str 21, Dex 13, Con 14, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2	12	19	30 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Entangle (Ex) A sea wasp can entangle a creature up to two sizes smaller than itself with its tentacles with a successful CMB check. An entangled opponent suffers tentacle damage and the effect of its poison each round the hold is maintained. An entangled creature still receives a save to avoid the effects of its poison. While a foe is entangled, the sea wasp cannot attack any other creature. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; the effects of the poison are determined by the creature's size (see table below). The DC of the save is Constitution-based. Size Fort DC Frequency Effect Cure Tiny 10 1/round for 1d4 rounds 1 Con 1 save Small 11 1/round for 1d4 rounds 1d2 Con 1 save Medium 11 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d3 Con 1 save Large 13 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d4 Con 2 consecutive saves Huge 15 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d6 Con 2 consecutive saves Gargantuan 20 1/round for 1d6 rounds 1d8 Con 3 consecutive saves Jet (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp can jet backward once per round as a full-round action at a speed equal to four times its swim speed. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting. Transparent (Ex) A monstrous sea wasp is nearly invisible floating in the water. An observer must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice the sea wasp. Watersense (Ex) Monstrous sea wasps can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with water.																												
Giant Emperor Scorpion	11.00	12800	Gargantuan	1	24, touch 7, flat-footed 23	142	14	6	6	ferocity			50 ft., burrow 10 ft.	2 claws +18 (2d6+11 plus grab), sting +18 (2d6+11 plus poison)		20 ft.	20 ft.	ambush pit, constrict (2d6+11), poison, pounce	Str 33, Dex 13, Con 20, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 2	11	+26 (+30 grapple)	37 (49 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Ambush Pit (Ex) A giant emperor scorpion can spend 1 minute digging itself into the soil or other ground debris. It then waits for its tremorsense to detect prey. When a creature comes within range, it can erupt from the ground as a free action as part of a charge, allowing it to use its pounce ability. When dug in, the scorpion has improved cover granting it a +10 bonus on Stealth checks.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str and 1d4 Dex; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A creature bitten by a gibrileth or damaged by a weapon it wields is exposed to this virulent disease. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save is needed to resist this creature's particular strain of demonplague-full details on this widespread sickness appear on page 29. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Tumors (Su) As a swift action, a gibrileth can rip a grapefruit-sized tumor from its body with one of its many arms and throw it as a splash weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage, and deals 1d4 points of acid splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target. A creature can avoid the splash damage with a successful DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Whip Specialist (Ex) A gibrileth does not provoke attacks of opportunity when using a whip.

Poison (Ex) Siphon dart-injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str damage and paralysis; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Siphon Dart (Ex) A gigas clam constantly rolls collected sediment and calcifications into needle-like darts it can eject through its siphons. A gigas clam can fire one of these darts as a standard action at a maximum range of 100 feet with no range increment, dealing an amount of damage equal to 2d6 plus its Strength modifier, and possibly poisoning the target.  Siphon Jet (Ex) As a full-round action, a gigas clam can use its powerful siphon to move a creature or object at least one size smaller up to 20 feet directly away from itself or directly toward itself in a straight line. A creature trapped in this stream of water can avoid the push or pull with a DC 22 Reflex save. A gigas clam can also use this jet to propel itself up to five times its swim speed in a straight line, and can use its trample attack in conjunction with this increased movement. If at any point during this movement the gigas clam comes in contact with a solid object (such as a ship's hull), it deals 4d8 points of damage as it rams the object with its durable shell. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Gnarlwood	11.00	12800	Huge	4	24, touch 8, flat-footed 24	147	15	6	6		22	vulnerability to fire	30 ft.	4 claws +18 (2d6+9)		15 ft.	15 ft.	rend (2 claws, 4d6+13)	Str 29, Dex 10, Con 23, Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 16	10	21	31	Tome of Horrors Complete	Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) With its animate dead spell-like ability a gnarlwood can animate any corpse within 60 feet. Because of their arboreal habitat, most gnarlwoods are accompanied by animal zombies and skeletons. Unhallowed Aura (Su) A gnarlwood emanates an unhallow spell in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Thus, a gnarlwood is constantly protected as by a magic circle from good, and the DC to resist positive channeled energy within 20 feet of it is reduced by 4 (at the same time the DC to resist negative channeled energy within 20 feet of a gnarlwood gain a +4 bonus). This aura can be dispelled or negated, but the gnarlwood can restart it again as a free action on its next turn.																												
Gnoph-Keh	11.00	12800	Large	1	25, touch 10, flat-footed 24	147	14	12	11			heat susceptible, vulnerable to fire	40 ft.	4 claws +20 (1d6+7), gore +20 (1d8+7/19-20/x3)		10 ft.	10 ft.	blizzard, powerful charge (gore, 2d8+14/ 19-20/x3)	Str 24, Dex 13, Con 20, Int 13, Wis 20, Cha 21	14	22	33 (41 vs. trip)	AP 46	Blizzard (Su) Once per hour as a standard action, a gnoph-keh can create a stationary blizzard that fills a 20-foot-radius spread. The gnoph-keh can place the center of this blizzard at any point within its reach. Multiple gnoph-kehs can use the aid another action to help a single gnoph-keh create a much larger blizzard-every additional gnoph-keh who aids the first increases the area of the blizzard's radius by 20 feet. All gnoph-kehs wishing to aid the primary creature must be within the area of that gnoph-keh's cold aura.  Once created, the blizzard remains active for 1 hour if it was created in a cold environment, or for 1 minute if created anywhere else. The wind in the blizzard's area blows in a clockwise circular pattern at windstorm speeds, restricts visibility as fog does, and makes the region count as difficult terrain. A gnoph-keh can move through a blizzard (either one created by magic or a naturally occurring blizzard) without penalty.  Cold Aura (Su) A gnoph-keh radiates an aura of blistering cold in a 30-foot radius. Any creature that ends its turn within this area takes 2d6 points of cold damage. While in a blizzard (either one created by magic, such as the gnoph-keh's blizzard power, or a naturally occurring blizzard), any creature that takes damage from a gnoph-keh's cold aura must make a DC 22 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered by the numbing cold for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Heat Susceptible (Ex) A gnoph-keh takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made to resist the effects of high temperatures (see page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). When a gnoph-keh takes damage from heat in this way, and the damage is from temperatures in excess of 90º F, the damage the creature takes is always lethal damage. In these conditions, the gnoph-keh's cold aura does not function at all.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the gnoph-keh climbs must be icy. The beast can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A gnoph-keh can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

Poisoned Web (Ex) This ability works like the web ability, but affects all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst. In addition, any creature hit by the web must save against the spider's poison.																												
Gongorinan	11.00	12800	Medium	10	27, touch 17, flat-footed 20	137	14	13	7		22		40 ft., climb 40 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (1d6), constrict (1d6+7), oviposition, web (+17 ranged, DC 22, 11 hp)	Str 23, Dex 23, Con 24, Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 20	11	+17 (+21 grapple)	34 (42 vs. trip)	AP 64	Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to a gongorinan's horrific appearance become confused for 1d4 rounds.  Oviposition (Su) A gongorinan can implant a stony egg the size of a human heart in the body of any Small or larger pinned, helpless, or willing creature as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This action deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to the victim. If the victim survives this damage, the egg takes root deep in the victim's body, links to his mind, and begins gestating. The egg grows rapidly, dealing 1 point of Intelligence drain every day to a minimum score of 1. Once this Intelligence drain affects a creature that already has an effective Intelligence score of 1, the egg "hatches" inside of the victim. This causes the victim to immediately transform into a horrid animal, aberration, magical beast, or vermin (the exact choice is made by the gongorinan according to its strange goals and unknowable desires), whereupon it begins living out its new life via pure instinct-this effect otherwise functions as if it were baleful polymorph to which the creature had failed its secondary Will save to retain its personality. A gongorinan can command the actions of a creature that has undergone this transformation as if the victim had been affected by dominate monster (this works even on creatures that are normally immune to such effects as a result of being mindless) as long as the gongorinan is within 120 feet of the creature. The effect can be reversed by break enchantment (DC 22-treat the gongorinan's Hit Dice as it caster level), but cannot be dispelled.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Strength damage and staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Any melee hit deals acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it makes a successful DC 23 Reflex save.  A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a greater ooze demon dissolves immediately unless it makes a successful DC 23 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  The greater ooze demon's acidic touch deals 23 points of acid damage per round to creatures or wooden or metal objects, but the greater ooze demon must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.

Each time a creature takes damage from the ooze's acid, its metal equipment and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 25 Reflex save prevents damage to such items. A metal or natural weapon that strikes a greater verdurous ooze takes 1d8 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 25 Reflex save. If a greater verdurous ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 25 points of acid damage (no save) on the object.

A creature that hears the laughter must succeed at a DC 23 Will saving thrown or be affected as the hideous laughter spell (CL 14th), except that a laughing creature is considered helpless to the harionago. A creature that successfully saves against a harionago's scornful laughter can't be affected by that same harionago's laughter for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect that can be countered with the countersong class feature. Its save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Hezrou	11.00	12800	Large	4	25, touch 9, flat-footed 25	145	16	3	9		22		30 ft., swim 30 ft.	bite +17 (4d4+8 plus grab), 2 claws +17 (1d8+8 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	nausea	Str 27, Dex 11, Con 29, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 18	10	+19 (+23 grapple)	29	PFRPG Bestiary	Nausea (Ex) The noxious vapors and foul fluids that constantly weep and seethe from a hezrou's body are particularly heinous to those the creature grapples. Each round a creature is grappled by a hezrou, the grappled foe must make a DC 24 Fortitude save to avoid becoming nauseated. A creature nauseated in this manner remains nauseated until he succeeds on a DC 24 Fortitude save, or until a minute has passed during which he is not grappled by the hezrou, whichever condition comes first. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Impundulu	11.00	12800	Medium	9	25, touch 15, flat-footed 20	133	13	14	10		22		20 ft. (30 ft. in humanoid form), fly 60 ft. (good)	bite +19 (1d6+4 plus 1d6 bleed and 1d6 electricity), 2 talons +19 (1d4+4 plus 1d6 electricity and grab), 2 hook +13 (1d4+2 plus 1d6 electricity)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (1d6), breath weapon (60-ft. line, 8d6 electricity, Reflex DC 21 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), electrical discharge	Str 18, Dex 21, Con 19, Int 15, Wis 18, Cha 20	14	+18 (+22 grapple)	33	AP 40	Blood Drain (Ex) If it grapples a foe, an impundulu drains blood at the end of its turn, dealing Constitution damage. Electrical Discharge (Su) An impundulu builds substantial electrical charges in its body-electrical charges visibly crackle about its form. If the impundulu hits a creature with two talons in the same round, this charge releases into that creature, dealing 4d6 points of electricity damage (this damage is in addition to the electricity damage from its talon attacks). The target may attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save for half damage. If one or both of the talon attacks is a critical hit, the jolt is so potent that the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds (creatures that are immune to electricity are immune to this stunning effect). The save DC is Constitution-based. Once the creature releases this charge, it cannot use this ability again for 1d4 rounds while it waits for the energy to build again (though this energy buildup does not affect the electrical damage from its regular talon attacks). Familiar Service A mortal of 7th level or higher with the Improved Familiar feat can summon an impundulu to serve as her familiar; an impundulu familiar appears as a birdlike imp or quasit, has the normal statistics of an imp or quasit, and loses all of its own abilities except its subtypes, alignment, and damage reduction. If its master is slain, the impundulu seizes its former master's soul, retreats to a hidden place, and consumes the soul, after which it metamorphoses over the next 24 hours into its natural form, regains all of its normal abilities, and becomes free; most aging masters pass on their impundulu familiars to younger family members rather than let the creatures turn on them. Shaman Form (Su) An impundulu using its change shape special quality can take on one specific humanoid form as if it had the change shape ability. This form usually resembles that of a jungle shaman, except it has claw-like fingernails and its feet end in talons. In this form, it cannot fly or use its breath weapon, electrical discharge, or hook attacks. An impundulu can remain in this form indefinitely. Its natural form is its bird form. If killed, it reverts to its true form. Witchcraft An impundulu serving as a witch's familiar gives its master additional spells known, just like a witch's patron. The master must choose from one of the following patron themes when binding the impundulu, and this choice cannot be changed without dismissing and re-summoning the impundulu: Agility, Elements, or Transformation. These patron spells known are in addition to any granted by the witch's actual patron.

Runes (Ex) Whenever a rune giant is affected by a spell or spell-like ability, it can cause the runes covering its body to flash with light. All creatures within 10 feet of the giant must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw is Charisma-based.																												
Iron Rhinoceros	11.00	12800	Huge	1	25, touch 9, flat-footed 24	131	6	7	4				40 ft.	gore +21 (3d8+9/19-20), 2 chains +19 (2d6+4 plus grab)		15 ft.	10 ft. (20 ft. with chains)	grasping chains, powerful charge (gore, 6d8+16 or scooping charge), powerful drag, swallow whole (2d6 fire damage, AC 18, 13 hp), trample (2d6+8 plus grasping chains, DC 26)	Str 28, Dex 12, Con -, Int 1, Wis 11, Cha 5	14	+25 (+29 grapple)	36 (40 vs. trip)	AP 95	Grasping Chains (Ex) An iron rhinoceros is covered in animated chains that grasp at its enemies. It doesn't gain the grappled condition when using its chains to grapple enemies, and can maintain a grapple using its chains as a free action, though doing so prevents it from attacking with that chain. An iron rhinoceros may have up to two creatures grappled in its chains at a time. Additionally, the chains seek to ensnare creatures the rhino tramples. The chains entangle any creature that fails its saving throw against the rhinoceros's trample attack, or that chooses to forgo its save in order to make an attack of opportunity against the rhinoceros. An entangled creature can escape from the chains as a standard action by succeeding on a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each chain has AC 12, hardness 10, and 15 hit points. Creatures entangled in the chains can't move farther than 20 feet away from the rhinoceros. If the rhinoceros moves farther than 20 feet from an entangled target, the tethering chain breaks, but the target remains entangled.  Powerful Drag (Ex) An iron rhinoceros can use the dragAPG combat maneuver to savagely scrape its foes across the ground. As a full-round action, an iron rhinoceros can attempt a single drag combat maneuver against every creature currently tethered to its grasping chains. This deals 1d6 points of damage for every 5 feet dragged, and the chains tethered to any creature more than 20 feet away break. The dragging damage may increase depending on the terrain, at the GM's discretion. Creatures dragged any distance are knocked prone.  Scooping Charge (Ex) An iron rhinoceros can unhinge its snout in order to scoop enemies into the furnace-like cavity within its belly. When making a powerful charge, the iron rhinoceros can forgo dealing damage in order to gain the grab and fast swallow abilities with its gore attack. The rhinoceros must make this choice at the beginning of its charge.  Swallow Whole (Ex) An iron rhinoceros's belly functions as a furnace, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to swallowed creatures. Hatches on the rhinoceros's sides allow it to swallow creatures grappled in its chains. In order to take swallowed creatures prisoner without dealing fire damage, the rhinoceros can suppress (or activate) the flames within its furnace as a swift action. When the rhinoceros is suppressing the flames, the furnace instead fills with smoke, forcing swallowed creatures to succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save each round or be sickened for as long as they remain in the rhinoceros's belly. This save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures attempting to cut their way out of the iron rhinoceros's belly must overcome the durability of the thick furnace walls (hardness 10).																												
Jinmenju	11.00	12800	Huge	3	25, touch 7, flat-footed 25	149	14	5	5				10 ft.	bite +15 (2d6+8/19-20), 2 slams +16 (1d8+8)		15 ft.	15 ft.	enticing head-fruits, intoxicating stench	Str 27, Dex 8, Con 22, Int 7, Wis 12, Cha 15	9	19	28	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Enticing Head-Fruits (Su) Any creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of a jinmenju must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be magically compelled to immediately grab a head-fruit and eat it. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that jinmenju's enticing head-fruits for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Anyone who takes a bite out of one suffers from the following effect.  Head-Fruit Poison: Head-fruit-ingested; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Wisdom damage and confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Intoxicating Stench (Su) Once per day as a swift action, a jinmenju can cause its fruits to emit an unnaturally sweet aroma in a 60-foot spread for 6 rounds. All creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 22 Will save each round or be captivated. A captivated creature takes no actions except to approach the jinmenju via the most direct route possible. If this path leads it into a dangerous area or the jinmenju attacks it, the captivated creature receives a new saving throw. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Unsettling Drone (Su) A jinmenju emits a low, persistent hum that unnerves living creatures that hear it. Those within 30 feet of it must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or become shaken until they leave the affected area and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that jinmenju's unsettling drone for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A successful DC 22 Reflex save reduces the acid damage by half (but does not reduce the profane damage).

Shrine (Ex) A juggernaut counts as a movable shrine for the deity or religion it is dedicated to.  Soul-Powered (Su) When a juggernaut kills a creature with at least 5 Hit Dice and an alignment two or more steps away from the juggernaut's alignment, it gains a kill point. Add its current total kill points as a bonus on its attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, caster level checks, and skill checks. Add half its current total kill points as a bonus to its natural armor and spell resistance. The juggernaut loses 1 kill point every 24 hours.  Vicious Trample (Ex) A juggernaut's massive rollers deal 8d6+38 points of damage on a successful trample attack.

Creatures that fail a DC 21 Will save become dazed for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save are dazzled for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Mischief (Su) A larabay can channel its magical energy through whatever one-handed weapon it wields to mystify and disorient foes. Creatures hit by a larabay's weapon must make a DC 21 Will save or take 1 point of Dexterity damage and become confused for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Lesser Gibbering Orb	11.00	12800	Large	7	20, touch 12, flat-footed 17	91	7	7	13	all-around vision	21		5 ft., fly 30 ft. (good)	6 bites +12 (1d8+3 plus grab)	6 eye rays +13 touch	10 ft.	5 ft.	eye rays, gibbering (60 ft.; DC 23 Will), steal spell, steal spell-like ability, swallow whole (1d8 acid damage, AC 14, hp 9)	Str 16, Dex 17, Con 17, Int 20, Wis 14, Cha 22	10	+14 (+18 grapple)	27 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Eye Rays (Su) Six of the eyes can produce a magical ray per round, with each eye emulating a spell from among the list of spells below as if cast by a 14th-level caster. The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than three rays at any single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 80 feet. Each of these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: daze monster, dispel magic, flaming sphere, inflict moderate wounds, magic missile, and ray of enfeeblement. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Flight (Sp) The gibbering orb's body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to cast fly, as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 30 ft. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent feather fall effect with personal range.  Gibbering (Su) As a free action, no more than once per 1d4 rounds, a gibbering orb can emit a cacophony of maddening sound. All creatures other than gibbering mouthers and gibbering orbs within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same orb's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Steal Spell/Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su) When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature's known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use any one of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see above) that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.																												
Living Sandstorm	11.00	12800	Medium	6	26, touch 17, flat-footed 19	147	9	15	12				30 ft., burrow 30 ft.	2 slams +24 (1d8+10 plus distraction)		5 ft.	5 ft.	distraction (DC 22), slashing sand	Str 31, Dex 22, Con 21, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 13	14	+24 (+26 sunder)	41 (43 vs. sunder)	AP 83	Change Shape (Su) A living sandstorm can shift between its humanoid form, shaped from packed sand, and a sandstorm form as a standard action. In sandstorm form, a living sandstorm functions as if it were a swarm of Fine creatures with a hive mind, and it loses its burrow speed, slam attacks, and compression abilities, but gains a fly speed and the ability to use its create sand and sand blast abilities. Its Strength score is reduced to 1, but its ability scores are otherwise unchanged. A living sandstorm remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form can't be dispelled, nor does the living sandstorm revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.  Sandsight (Ex) The living sandstorm can see through sand, dust, and other particles in the air as if the air were clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.  Slashing Sand (Ex) A living sandstorm's swarm attack deals slashing damage. Its slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.																												
Living Sandstorm	11.00	12800	Fine	6	34, touch 25, flat-footed 27	147	9	15	12	swarm traits			30 ft., fly 60 ft.

All creatures in the area and adjacent squares must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Medium and smaller creatures in the area are buried and must begin holding their breath to avoid drowning in the sand. By attempting a Reflex save against the same DC, a creature can avoid being buried if there is an adjacent space outside the area to which it can move; if the save is successful, the creature is moved into an available adjacent space. As a standard action, each buried creature can dig itself out or be dug out by another with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Invisible creatures in or adjacent to the area when the sand is created are outlined until the dust is removed. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Sand Blast (Ex) When in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can attack with a blast of scouring sand in a 20-foot line. The sand deals 6d6 points of slashing damage and blinds creatures in the area for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the blinding. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Digest Magic (Su) A magic item swallowed by a lukwata must make a DC 22 Fortitude save after an hour or become permanently nonmagical. Artifacts are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Dispelling Bite (Su) When a lukwata scores a critical hit with its bite, the victim is affected as if targeted by a greater dispel magic spell. The caster level for this effect is equal to the lukwata's Hit Dice (CL 14th for most lukwatas).  Eldritch Encrustation (Su) Crystalline growths along the lukwata's digestive tract contain large deposits of magical energy. These nodes are responsible for the magical feedback that surrounds each lukwata, granting it its spell resistance, damage reduction, dispelling bite, and digest magic abilities. Dispel magic cast on a lukwata can negate these powers for 1 minute-the CL of the effect is treated as the lukwata's Hit Dice (CL 11th for most lukwatas).																												
Marax	11.00	12800	Large	6	25, touch 11, flat-footed 23	152	17	12	7				40 ft.	bite +20 (2d6+9/19-20), 2 talons +20 (1d8+9), tail barbs +18 (1d6+4 plus poison)		10 ft.	10 ft.

Cunning and brutal, maraxes are far-ranging predators from Castrovel's mist-shrouded landscape. Gifted with vicious weapons, dense armor, and a paralytic venom, a single marax is a match for even the greatest hunter. A pack can easily bring down Castrovel's largest creatures and defend their territory against the planet's most fearsome competitors.  Variations of maraxes dot Castrovel's different regions just as big cats stalk Golarion's. Different subspecies can be identified by their varying fur colors and patterns and the arrangement of ridges on their dorsal plates. Maraxes typically stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh up to 900 pounds.  Ecology  While they are far from the most dangerous predators on their homeworld, maraxes stand among the planet's more successful hunters thanks to their inherent adaptability. Perfectly suited to the forests and plains of Castrovel, they roam enormous territories as lone hunters or in small packs.

This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.

Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)  A gray dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.  • Young-fog cloud;  • Juvenile-create water;  • Old-control winds;  • Ancient-control water;  Water Breathing (Ex) A gray dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.

A mute hag is immune to gaze attacks, and cannot use spell completion or command word trigger magic items.  Shaping Touch (Su) The touch of a mute hag twists flesh like clay. As a full-round action that draws an attack of opportunity, a mute hag may change the appearance of a grappled or helpless victim. The effect acts as a permanent alter self spell. Unwilling victims may resist the transformation with a DC 21 Fortitude save. A mute hag allowed to work for 10 minutes may also increase a victim's age category by one step; doing so does not grant mental ability score boosts but does inflict physical ability score penalties as normal.  Creatures that are affected by this power or successfully save against it cannot be affected by the same hag's shaping touch for one month. The DC is Charisma-based.

Laser Rifle (Ex) A myrmidon's eye is an integrated laser rifle. This weapon has a range increment of 250 feet.  Quantum Lash (Ex) A myrmidon's two facial tentacles lash out with surprising force, and are capable of extending up to a reach of 20 feet. These lashes are primary attacks that deal force damage on a successful hit. They resolve as touch attacks, but the damage dealt is not modified by Strength, nor can it be improved via Power Attack. A quantum lash threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. A quantum lash that strikes a force field or force effect has a chance to disrupt that effect. Against a magical force effect like a wall of force, the myrmidon makes a special check as if it were casting dispel magic against the effect (CL 11th). Against a robot's  force field, the robot struck must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or its force field is deactivated for 1d10 rounds, after which it returns at the same hit point level it was at before it was deactivated. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  Resilient (Ex) Myrmidons receive a +3 racial bonus on all saving throws.  Rockets (Ex) As a standard action, a myrmidon can fire a rocket to a range of 800 feet.

A myrmidon carries a maximum of five rockets. Its core can replenish fired rockets at the rate of one per 12 hours, crafting new rockets from scrap metal and other collected components used in the construction process.

The bones shudder and twist within each creature, dealing 10d6 points of damage and giving each creature the sickened condition for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickened condition. If this damage kills a creature, some of its bones tear free from its body and fuse with the bone devil, healing it for 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die of the slain creature. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Pain Blast (Su) Once per round as a free action, a bone devil can stimulate extreme pain in one creature within its reach.

The spores deal 2d8 points of damage on the first round as they grow into ugly vines; for the next 10 rounds, they deal 1d6 points of damage and entrap the affected creatures (DC 21, 10 rounds, hardness 5, hp 10). The vines can be destroyed by casting bless on the creatures or by sprinkling them with holy water. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Manic Dance of Ruin (Su) A mythic vrock can expend one use of mythic power to dance and chant as a full-round action, after which it releases a crackling wave of energy, dealing 5d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within 100 feet (Reflex DC 17 for half). Each additional vrock that joins in the dance adds 1 to the DC and an additional 5d6 points of damage, up to a maximum of 20d6. The dance immediately ends and must be started anew if any of the participating vrocks is slain, stunned, or otherwise prevented from dancing.

All nihilois can communicate telepathically with all other nihilois within 3 miles. An intermediary nihiloi can even pass messages between others of their race separated over long distances. They can also communicate telepathically with members of other races within 50 feet.  Malleable (Su) Nihilois exists as shadow, congealed into tangible but ever-twisting forms. Anytime a nihiloi is aware of imminent attack, it receives the benefit of 20% concealment, as it can warp and shift its body to avoid the blow.  See in Darkness (Su) Nihilois can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell.  Shadow Crafting (Sp) Five times per day, when in an area of dim light or darkness, a nihiloi can manipulate shadow to reproduce an effect identical to shadow evocation. Typically, these effects are DC 19 to resist, but if both the nihiloi and its target are within areas of dim light or darkness, the DC increases by +2. This is a shadow effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Tendrils (Su) Once aware of enemies nearby, as a standard action, a nihiloi can unleash its tendrils in a haze of umbral whips that surrounds the area within 10 feet of it. Any creature that enters this area takes 4d6+3 points of damage from dozens of deadly lashes (Reflex save DC 23 for half damage). A nihiloi must take an additional standard action to end this effect.

Water's Fury (Su)As a standard action, a noble marid can release a jet of water in a 60-foot line that deals 1d6 points of damage and blinds the target struck for 1d6 rounds. A DC 21 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the blinding effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Vortex (Su)A noble marid can transform into a vortex of swirling, churning water once every 10 mintues. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind ability, save that it can only be used while the noble marid is underwater; a noble marid cannot leave a body of water while in vortex form.

In this form it is immune to all damage short of disintegration. As a free action, an ossuary golem can reassemble into its conglomerate form to attack. While living prey is nearby, an ossuary golem will not use its disassemble ability. Use of this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) An ossuary golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted: An animate dead spell causes several of the golem's bones to spell) the golem for 1d4 rounds. A raise dead spell with a successful touch attack deals 5d6 points of damage. A resurrection spell with a successful touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (15d6 maximum). A speak with dead spell stuns the golem for 1 round as the spirits of the many deceased temporarily confuse it while vying for control of their individual bodies. A true resurrection spell with a successful touch attack deals 10 points of damage per caster level to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level (as the harm spell).  Wounding (Ex) The jagged, bony claws of an ossuary golem function as wounding weapons, dealing 1 point of bleed damage per hit. Bleeding creatures take the bleed damage at the start of their turns. Bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage. A critical hit does not multiply the bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this bleed damage.

A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by a panthereon must succeed at a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature.  Eye Beam (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a panthereon can unleash a beam of blinding light at a target within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack. The beam deals 2d8 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by this beam must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 hour.  Haste (Su) After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a panthereon can gain the benefits of haste once per day as a free action. The effect lasts 6 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A panthereon is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A disintegrate spell slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage (no save).  • A soften earth and stone spell cast directly at a panthereon reduces its damage reduction to DR 2/ adamantine and bludgeoning for 1d4 rounds.  • Any magical attack against a panthereon that deals electricity damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would normally deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A panthereon gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal electricity damage.

This effect lasts as long as the guardian wields them and for 1 minute thereafter. The guardian uses these as if its Strength score equaled its Charisma score.  Insightful Strike (Ex) A pharaonic guardian gains a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls against foes whose thoughts it has read via its judging gaze ability.  Judging Gaze (Su) A pharaonic guardian's gaze attack reads the minds of those it sees, as the detect thoughts spell with 3 rounds of concentration. This gaze has a range of 30 feet, and can be negated with a successful DC 22 Will save. This is a mindaffecting divination effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Soul-Rending Wings (Su) As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, a pharaonic guardian can flare its wings to fire rays of soulcutting light in two 30-foot lines extending away from it. Living creatures in the lines gain 1 negative level (Reflex DC 22 negates). A creature whose mind the pharaonic guardian has read from its judging gaze ability takes a -2 penalty on this save.

Each time a creature takes damage from a putrid ooze's acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid (Reflex DC 23 negates damage to clothing and armor). A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a putrid ooze takes 2d6 points of acid damage, unless the weapon's wielder succeeds at a DC 23 Reflex save. If a putrid ooze remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, the object takes 30 points of acid damage (no save). The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Splatter (Ex) As a standard action, a putrid ooze can throw a portion of its acidic sludge at a creature within 30 feet. The putrid ooze must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit the target.

All creatures within 30 feet of the razor treant suffer 10d4 slashing damage and 1d4 bleed damage (DC 20 Reflex save for half and no bleed damage). Those who fail the Reflex save must succeed on an additional DC 20 Will save or be staggered for 1 round from the terrible pain of the hundreds of small wounds inflicted on them.  Using this attack leaves the razor treant without its razor leaves for 2-6 days so it only resorts to this tactic in desperate situations.  Razor Leaves (Ex) Razor treants grow razors instead of leaves, hence the name. These extremely keen steel blades range from one to three inches in length and can easily cut through flesh. Any physical attack made by a razor treant is counted as being keen and wounding (already incorporated into the statistics above). Even merely touching a razor treant (including unarmed melee attacks) inflicts 1d4 points of slashing damage plus wounding on the victim.  When a razor treant is struck for more than 20 points of damage in a single blow, it loses some of its poorly connected leaves. Everyone within 30 feet of the razor treant suffers 1d4 points of wounding slashing damage (DC 20 Reflex negates).  The razor leaves break down quickly after the treant's death, remaining for only 1d2 rounds. The area around the treant is considered difficult terrain during that time.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.  • A magical attack that deals electricity damage deals half damage to the golem. Additionally, for 1d4+1 rounds the golem gains the benefits of haste and goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing an object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach; it then moves on to spread more destruction. The golem comes back under the control of its creator when the duration ends.  • A transmute metal to wood spell reduces the robot golem's damage reduction by 5 and its natural armor bonus by 9 for 1d4 rounds.  • A robot golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.  Rend Construct (Ex) This functions as the rend special ability, except the robot golem can rend only other constructs.  Shockwave (Ex) A robot golem can release a pulse of electrical energy held within its nonfunctioning batteries as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This pulse is a 30-foot-radius spread that deals 8d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures in its area of effect (Reflex DC 19 half).

Each of these forms has a unique appearance (such as a female dwarf with red hair, an elderly male human, and so on) and the naga can only use this ability to assume these five forms. The naga can still use its dual gaze in humanoid form.  Dual Gaze (Su) A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of crippling those that meet its gazes. The creature has two gaze attacks and can switch between them as a move action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become permanently blinded, while the other causes those that succumb to be permanently deafened. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the effects of either gaze; otherwise, the effects are permanent until cured. Royal nagas generally prefer to keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the blindness gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already been deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be harmed by gaze attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Spells A royal naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.

Shachath	11.00	12800	Medium	11	25, touch 18, flat-footed 17	148	11	14	14		22		30 ft., fly 50 ft. (average)	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	blasphemous influence, lingering doubt, merge with host	Str 25, Dex 25, Con 26, Int 18, Wis 20, Cha 21	11	18	36	AP 75	Blasphemous Influence (Su) A victim that falls under the effects of a shachath's merge with host ability becomes chaotic evil. Divine spellcasters subject to a shachath's merge with host ability temporarily lose connection with their faith, and now gain their divine powers from the Abyss or a demon lord the shachath serves. Though they can still cast the spells they had prepared, they cannot cast spells with the lawful or good descriptor. If the victim of a shachath's merging had access to the Good domain, that access changes to the Evil domain. If the victim had access to the Law domain, that access changes to the Chaos domain. If the victim had access to a subdomain associated with the Good or Law domain, that subdomain changes to the Demon subdomain. These changes last as long as the shachath remains merged with the victim. Other domain choices are not adjusted. If the victim is rescued from the shachath's influence and the merge ends without the victim's death, the victim remains chaotic evil-this may result in the victim losing some or all class abilities. An atonement spell can restore the victim's alignment at no additional cost, at which point lost class abilities are restored.  Lingering Doubt (Su) Once per day, a shachath can use a touch attack to affect a creature with lingering doubt. The target must be able to cast divine spells, be able to channel positive energy, or have the lay on hands ability. If the target fails a DC 20 Will save, all augury, commune, divination, and similar spells cast by the target automatically fail. In addition, using divine spells and spell-like abilities, channeling positive energy, or using lay on hands has a 20% chance of failure. This curse is permanent, but can be removed normally. The target cannot detect the curse on itself, but other creatures may detect the curse normally. A shachath may use scrying on the cursed creature as if it knew the target well, and doing so requires only a full-round action. A shachath may only curse one creature at any given time. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Merge with Host (Su) As a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, a shachath can merge its body with that of a helpless creature and control it if the victim fails a DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same shachath's merge with host ability for 24 hours. While merged with a victim, a shachath gains control of the body and may use it as its own, as if it controlled the target via dominate monster. Misdirection or similar effects can hide the victim's alignment change. The shachath has full access to all of the host's defensive and offensive abilities, and the shachath can still use its own spell-like abilities as well. As long as the shachath occupies the host, it knows (and can speak) the languages known by the victim and basic information about the victim's identity and personality. It can learn specific memories or knowledge from the victim by telepathic communication as needed. Damage dealt to a host body does not harm the shachath, and if the host body is slain, the shachath emerges and is dazed for 1 round. A shachath can choose to abandon a host body as an immediate action, but doing so causes the host to be dazed for 1 round, and the shachath must wait 24 hours before attempting to use merge with host again on any target. A shachath can be ejected from a host through the use of break enchantment (against CL 13th), dispel chaos, or dispel evil. Merge with host is a mind-affecting possession effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Subtle Magic (Su) Whenever a shachath targets a creature with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, and that spell or ability has no obvious physical effects, the targeted creature has no sense of having been the target of a magical effect after making a successful saving throw against the effect. If the ability requires a touch attack but the target is unaware of being threatened, the shachath can attempt an opposed Bluff or Sleight of Hand check to touch the target without arousing suspicion or being noticed.  Trophy Taker (Su) A shachath that takes a personal item from a prospective target can wield greater power over that creature. The item must be something that the target considers its own possession and carries with it most of the time (for example, a piece of jewelry, a favored weapon, a holy symbol, or some other memento). The shachath gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw DCs for all of its supernatural or spell-like abilities that target the owner of the trophy. This bonus increases to +4 if the trophy is the target's holy symbol. A shachath can only have one trophy at any time, and it loses any benefit from an existing trophy if it takes a new one.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone idol (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the stone idol's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.  A disintegrate spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol.  A chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight spell deals 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells.  Rejuvenation (Su) Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in 1d4+2 days.  Site Bound (Ex) A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it is brought back into the area.  Smite (Su) As a free action, every 1d4+1 rounds, a shedu stone idol can unleash a burst of holy energy from its body in a 20-foot-radius burst. All creatures caught within the area take damage as follows: evil-aligned outsiders, 10d6 points of damage; evil-aligned non-outsiders, 6d6 points of damage; good- and neutral-aligned creatures, 6d6 points of damage. A DC 20 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. A creature that fails its save is blinded for 1d4 rounds as well. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: Warp wood or wood shape slows a skiff golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the skiff golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A skiff golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal cold damage. Repel wood drives the skiff golem back 30 feet and deals 2d12 points of damage to it (no save). Ironwood heals a skiff golem of all its lost hit points.  Man Overboard (Ex) A skiff golem can rock itself violently back and forth as a move action, causing all those onboard to fall into the water (which if on the River Styx could be a very bad thing indeed). A creature can attempt to maintain its footing and grab onto the skiff golem by succeeding on a DC 27 Acrobatics check. The check DC is Strength-based.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  • A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.  Slow (Su) A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet in a burst centered on the golem and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to negate. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This movement is very taxing, and a svathurim must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution check at the end of each round it uses this ability to avoid being fatigued for 1 minute. This DC increases by 2 each round after the first. Returning to the ground resets the DC to 14, but does not negate any ongoing fatigue or exhaustion. A svathurim cannot trample when using this ability.  Thunderous Trample (Su) Any creature damaged by a svathurim's trample attack must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although a svathurim is Huge, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Large humanoid. As a result, it wields weapons as if they were one size category smaller than their actual size (Large for most svathurim).

Skyrunner (Su) When charging, running, or taking a double move, a svathurim can stride across open air as if it were using air walk. This movement is very taxing; a svathurim must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution check at the end of each round it uses this ability or become fatigued for 1 minute. This DC increases by 2 for each round after the first. Returning to the ground resets the DC to 14, but doesn't negate any ongoing fatigue or exhaustion.

When swallowed, a victim is transported to its own lightless pocket dimension-a stone prison just large enough to contain the victim. Creatures do not take damage within this pocket dimension, but there is only enough air inside to last for 3 rounds. At the end of the third round, the trapped creature must hold its breath or risk suffocation. A creature that attempts to carve its way out of this dimension with a weapon must be able to penetrate the surrounding walls' hardness 8. When a creature manages to cut its way out of this dimension,  it appears to leap out of the taotieh's mouth to emerge into any square adjacent to the taotieh's space-no actual hole is created in the creature, and new creatures that are swallowed later must cut their own way out. When a taotieh is destroyed, its body bursts open to allow the contents of its extradimensional stomachs to spill out into adjacent spaces. A taotieh can swallow up to four creatures at any one time.

This attack has a range of 200 feet with no range increment, and requires a ranged touch attack to hit.  A creature critically hit by a thunderbolt is stunned and deafened for 1 round if it fails a DC 22 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Storm Aura (Su) A thunderbird is surrounded by a 100-footradius spread of severe winds that blow out from the center, dissipating swiftly at the limit of the aura's range. In this area, ranged weapons (but not siege weapons) take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, Fly checks are made at a -4 penalty, and exposed flames are extinguished. Small creatures must make a DC 10 Strength check (if on the ground) or a DC 20 Fly check to move toward the thunderbird, while Tiny or smaller creatures can be knocked backward (1d4 x 10 feet if they are on the ground and fail a DC 15 Strength check, or 2d6 x 10 feet if they are flying and fail a DC 25 Fly check). Creatures on the ground that are pushed back take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet, and flying creatures that are pushed back take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage regardless of the distance they are pushed.  In addition, once every 1d4 rounds, a bolt of lightning strikes a random creature (other than the thunderbird) within the area of its storm aura. This bolt of lightning deals 12d6 points of electricity damage (DC 22 Reflex halves). The save DC for the lightning bolt is Constitutionbased, while those for resisting the wind effects are fixed.  Stormsight (Ex) A thunderbird ignores all vision penalties and concealment from weather effects, including those created by fog cloud, obscuring mist, and similar spells.

Find Target (Sp) When ordered to find its programmed target, a witch-doll golem does so unerringly, as though guided by discern location. Linked Attack (Su) When a witch-doll golem successfully establishes a witchdoll link, any damage taken by the witch-doll golem from any source other than the linked host deals half its damage to the golem and half its damage to the linked target so long as they are within 60 feet of each other. Only the linked target can successfully attack a witchdoll golem and not take "linked damage". Attacks that don't damage a witch-doll golem (because of its immunities or its damage reduction) likewise deal no damage to the linked target. Attacks that damage the linked target do not damage the witchdoll golem (the link it establishes is one way). Healing (or repair in the case of the witch-doll golem) is not passed through the link. A witch-doll golem cannot be programmed to attack itself in order to damage its programmed target.  Witch-Doll Link (Su) A witch-doll golem can establish an invisible link between itself and its programmed target by making a successful melee attack against its programmed target. If successful, the opponent can attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save to resist the link. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. A witch-doll link is broken if the witch-doll golem is destroyed, the target dies, or the witch-doll golem is programmed with a new target. A witch-doll golem cannot establish this link with any other creature other than its programmed target. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A witch-doll golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells function differently against the creature, as noted below. A confusion spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A mending spell heals 2d6 hit points. Resist Magic (Ex) A witch-doll golem gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against any spell or spell-like ability or effect cast by its programmed target (provided the effect gets past its immunity to magic). The witch-doll does not have to be linked to its target to gain this bonus.

Tidal Wave (Su) Once per day, a great wyrm sea dragon can create a tidal wave. This ability is the same as the bronze dragon's ability of the same name (Bestiary 104).  Torrent Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of super-heated steam, a very young or older sea dragon can breathe a line of pressurized water twice the length of the sea dragon's cone breath weapon. This line deals bludgeoning damage.  Unfettered Swimmer (Su) A juvenile sea dragon gains a 10-foot bonus to its swim speed.

At the start of the aeon's turn, the victim gains 1d4 negative levels (a DC 23 Fortitude save negates and grants immunity to this akhana's soul siphoning ability for 24 hours). When the number of negative levels equals the target's Hit Dice, the target's soul tears free from its mortal body and gets stored within the body of the akhana as a trap the soul spell. The victim's body remains preserved as if via a gentle repose spell for as long as the soul is held by the akhana. The akhana can keep the soul indefinitely, or can release it as a full-round action.  Upon doing so, the released soul immediately returns to its body if the body is within 300 feet, at which point the body returns to life and any negative levels imparted to it by the akhana are removed. If the body is not within 300 feet (or if it has been destroyed), then the creature dies when its soul is released. A miracle, limited wish, or wish can force a displaced soul to return to its proper body. If an akhana is slain, any soul it contains is released automatically. An akhana can only hold one soul at a time. The save DC is Constitution-based.

An animated tank has its weapons arranged on all sides of its body and can make three machine gun attacks and one Hotchkiss 6 pounder attack each round. An animated tank's weapons can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder attempts), but cannot easily be harvested for use once the animated tank is destroyed. An animated tank is always proficient with its weapons, and its ranged weapons do not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat.  Telekinesis (Su) The pickled brain that animates the tank possesses a supernatural ability to manipulate its surroundings and reload its armament. The animated tank can use telekinesis as a standard action every 1d4 rounds (caster level 16th).

Bone Crawler	12.00	19200	Huge	3	11, touch 11, flat-footed 8   18, touch 8, flat-footed 18	114	9	9	10	bone armor, cannot be flanked	23		20 ft. in bone armor (30 ft. base), climb 10 ft.	up to 12 bone blades +16 (1d8+8/19-20) and/or up to 12 whipfronds +15 (1d4+8)		15 ft.	10 ft.	bone blades, whipfronds, whirling frenzy	Str 26, Dex 16, Con 21, Int 9, Wis 15, Cha 9	9	19	32	Tome of Horrors 4	Bone Armor (Ex) The bone crawler is normally encountered encased in a shell of iron-hard bones. This shell has a hardnes of 10, takes half damage from energy attacks (except sonic attacks) and has hit points equal to 10 x (HD + 1). Bone armor weighs 1 pound per hit point. It can take damage like any object, though it receives the bone crawler's saving throws and spell resistance. Unlike carried objects, area of effect attacks require the bone crawler to roll a separate saving throw for its bone armor, even if it makes the saving throw itself. Spel l resistance is checked just once for the overall creature and its armor, however. While it bears bone armor, the bone crawler receives no bonus to AC for its Dexterity. After the first 10 hi tpoints of damage, every 10 hit points worth of bone armor provides the bone crawler with one bone blade that it can use in melee as described below. As its armor receives damage, it likewise loses these bone blades. The last 10 hit points of bone armor represent those protecting the main body itself; until the armor is destroyed, the central body is considered to have total cover. A bone crawler can repair its armor by absorbing new bones into its mass. This requires a 24-hour period while enzymes secreted by specialized tendrils harden the bone. The number of hit points gained depends on the size of the skeleton or bone collection absorbed: a Tiny skeleton repairs 1 hit point, a Small skeleton 1d4 hit points, a Medium skeleton 2d4 hit points, and Large and larger skeletons 4d4 hit points. Note that skeletons of Huge size and larger contain many bones that are too large for the bone crawler to absorb effectively into its mass, which is why the hit points gained do not increase after Large size.  Bone Blade (Ex) The bone crawler has a number of bony limbs that it can manipulate with its whipfronds. When attacking with these, it gains its full attack bonus as a primary weapon attack. It can only attack a creature or creatures in a single 5 ft. square with a maximum of 4 bone blades at once. Sunder attacks directed at bone blades do damage to the creature's bone armor (see above).  Whipfrond (Ex) The bone crawler's primary attacking tentacles are called whipfronds. It has one whipfrond per hit die. A whipfrond can be severed with a successful Sunder attack with a slashing weapon that inflicts, in a single blow, a number of points of damage equal to or greater than the bone crawler's hit dice. Whipfronds cannot be sundered while encased in bone armor; the armor must be destroyed first. As with the bone blades, the bone crawler can only attack a single 5 ft. square area with up to 4 whipfronds at a time, no more.  Whirling Frenzy (Ex) As a full round action the bone crawler may whirl its bone blades around it in a swirling storm of sharpened edges. This attack inflicts 1d8+4 points of damage per three bone blades used (round down) on anyone within the bone crawler's reach. A DC 19 Reflex save is allowed to take only half damage from this attack; alternately, a targeted creature may opt instead to make an attack of opportunity against the bone crawler instead. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

This supernatural ability works like alter self (CL 12th), but the cacodaemon can remain in the chosen form indefinitely. It can assume a new form as a standard action or return to its own as a free action.																												
Calikang	12.00	19200	Large	6	27, touch 11, flat-footed 25	157	12	11	11	defensive slam, energy absorption, suspend animation	23		30 ft.	#ERROR!		10 ft.	10 ft.	breath weapon (60-foot line, 14d6 energy damage, Reflex DC 22 half, usable 1/day)	Str 25, Dex 15, Con 20, Int 8, Wis 14, Cha 17	15	23	35	Inner Sea World Guide	Defensive Slam (Ex) A calikang gains a cumulative +1 shield bonus to its AC for each of its arms that does not wield a manufactured weapon, to a maximum of +4 for four hands. A calikang can make slam attacks with these arms without losing this AC bonus.  Energy Absorption (Su) A spell that inflicts energy damage that is defeated by the calikang's SR or immunity to electricity is absorbed into its body, healing it for an amount of damage equal to the absorbed spell's caster level and granting an additional daily use of its breath weapon.  Breath Weapon (Su) A calikang can choose what kind of energy damage its breath weapon inflicts when it uses this ability, choosing from acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy.  Calikangs are particularly adept at using electricity in this manner, and inflict 1 additional point of damage per die (+14 for most calikangs) when they elect to inflict electricity damage with their breath weapon.  Suspend Animation (Su) As a full-round action, a calikang can enter a state of suspended animation, freezing in place and becoming motionless. It remains aware of its surroundings.  In this state, the calikang is immune to disease, inhaled toxins, poison, starvation, and thirst, and receives a +4 bonus on all Fortitude saves. The calikang can exit this state as an immediate action-if it does so to attack a foe or initiate combat, it gains a +4 insight bonus on its Initiative check.																												
Candlestone Courtier	12.00	19200	Medium	9	26, touch 20, flat-footed 16	161	11	20	14		23		30 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	spellthrust	Str 16, Dex 29, Con 20, Int 16, Wis 17, Cha 23	9	+12 (+16 trip)	32 (34 vs. trip)	Andoran Birthplace Of Freedom	Fey Bargain (Su) Once per week, a Candlestone courtier can grant a limited wish or a permanent +2 inherent bonus to one ability score. In exchange, the bargainer is cursed to be carried off in its dreams each night by the courtier to a never-ending fey ball that, while pleasant as often as not, affects the dreamer as nightmare, requiring a saving throw each night (Will DC 21 negates). The DC to remove this curse is reduced by 4 if the courtier is killed, and a successful coup de grace on the courtier with a cold iron weapon automatically ends the curse. Ending the curse also ends any noninstantaneous effects of the bargain. A creature can have only one fey bargain at a time.  Spellthrust (Su) When a courtier threatens a critical hit, it can trigger a spell-like ability with a range of touch against the target. If the critical hit is confirmed, the target must save twice, using the lower result.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Trilling (Ex) By rapidly vibrating its carapace, a chain worm emits a high-pitched trilling sound that stuns and deafens all creatures within range. All living creatures within 30 feet that hear it must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds and deafened for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

All lawful or good creatures in this area take a -1 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. Lawful good creatures take a -3 penalty and upon first entering the aura must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as they remain in the area.  This ability is Charisma-based.  Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to a chernobue's horrific appearance become paralyzed with disgust for 2d6 rounds; a paralyzed creature gets a new save each round to recover from the effect, provided he is no longer aware of the chernobue or within 30 feet of it.  Light Vulnerability (Ex) A chernobue within an area of bright light takes 1 point of Constitution damage per minute it remains in the area.  Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con drain; cure 1 save. The thick, orange poison injected by a chernobue is semi-alive. As soon as the poisoned victim is cured of the poison (by making a save, being targeted with an effect like neutralize poison, or enduring the full duration of the poison), the orange fluid bursts from the victim's body, causing 1d6 Charisma damage and rendering the victim unconscious for 2d6 rounds unless he makes a final DC 23 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Clockwork Golem	12.00	19200	Large	1	26, touch 10, flat-footed 25	118	5	6	5				30 ft.	2 slams +23 (2d10+8 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	death burst, grind, wall of gears	Str 27, Dex 12, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	16	+25 (+29 grapple)	36	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Death Burst (Ex) When a clockwork golem is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it explodes in a shower of razor-sharp gears and debris. All creatures within a 10-foot burst take 12d6 points of slashing damage-a DC 18 Reflex save results in half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Grind (Ex) A clockwork golem deals an additional 2d10+12 points of slashing damage when it makes a successful grapple check as razor-sharp gears and blades emerge from its body to grind and slice its foe.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A clockwork golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a clockwork golem, as noted below.  • A grease spell cast on the golem causes it to move quickly for 1d6 rounds, as if under the effects of haste.  • A rusting grasp spell deals damage to a clockwork golem normally, and makes the golem staggered for 1d6 rounds (no save).  Wall of Gears (Su) As a standard action, a clockwork golem can fold into a whirling wall of grinding gears measuring 10 feet by 10 feet or 5 feet by 20 feet. Anyone passing through the wall takes 15d6 points of slashing damage. If the wall appears in a creature's space, that creature can attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to leap to one side and avoid the damage entirely. The clockwork golem can take no actions while in this form except to resume its normal form as a move action. A clockwork golem's AC and immunities remain the same while it is in this form.

Grind (Ex) A clockwork leviathan deals an additional 1d8+16 points of slashing damage when it makes a successful grapple check because of the myriad twisting gears and churning pistons that make up its jagged underbelly.  Swallow Whole (Ex) A clockwork leviathan's interior is filled with injurious grinding gears and superheated water-in addition to taking damage, a swallowed creature must hold its breath or risk drowning as long as it remains inside a clockwork leviathan's "stomach."

All creatures within 30 feet that can see the coloxus must make a DC 24 Will save or be slowed for up to 6 rounds. Each subsequent round, the coloxus must take a swift action to maintain the effect or the effect ceases at the end of its turn. Additionally, the sound creates a buffer against sonic energy, granting the fly demon immunity to sonic attacks or effects while it continues to drone. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Siphon (Su) Any creature bitten by a coloxus must make a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. A coloxus heals itself of 5 points of damage for every point of Charisma damage it deals. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Crystallis	12.00	19200	Large	1	25, touch 10, flat-footed 24	147	11	10	12				30 ft., burrow 30 ft.	2 claws +21 (2d10+7 plus 1d6 bleed)		10 ft.	10 ft.	crystalline claws, bleed (1d6), petrification cloud	Str 24, Dex 12, Con 21, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10	14	22	33	Tome of Horrors Complete	Bleed (Ex) The razor-sharp claws of a crystallis cause such persistent wounds a DC 19 Heal check is required to stop the bleed damage. Healing magic works as usual.  Crystalline Claws (Ex) A crystallis's claws are extraordinarily strong and are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This is a function of the creature itself and if the claws are somehow detached or removed (say from a dead crystallis) they immediately crumble into fine powder.  Petrification Cloud (Su) A crystallis can breathe forth a cloud of orange smoke as a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds.  The cloud fills a 10-foot cube in front of the crystallis and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. A living creature caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or turn into a crystal, gem-encrusted statue. A stone to flesh spell cannot undo this effect, but a wish or miracle can. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Immunity to Earth (Ex) Crystallis' are immune to all attacks from earth creatures (creatures with the earth subtype).  They cannot be affected by an earth creature's melee or ranged attacks or any special attack or effect that relies on touch or contact. Spell-like abilities and spells that do not require a touch attack cast by an earth creature affect a crystallis normally (but see its immunity to earth magic below).  Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex) Crystallis' are immune to all spells and effects with the earth descriptor and all spells of the Earth domain. Additionally, crystallises are immune to disintegration magic (a disintegrate spell for example).

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Scorpions (Ex) A daraka's body is swarming with thousands of tiny scorpions. Creatures attacking a daraka unarmed or with natural weapons are automatically stung for 1d6 points of damage and suffer the effects of the scorpion's poison (see Poison, above).  Alternately, a daraka can sling scorpions from its body to a range of 20 feet. This is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature hit takes 1d6 points of damage from the stinging scorpions and is subjected to their poison. A grappled creature is likewise subjected to the stinging of a daraka's scorpions just as if it had attacked the daraka unarmed (see above).  A daraka has an unlimited supply of scorpions. As fast as it uses them, its body generates more.																												
Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath	12.00	19200	Huge	7	27, touch 11, flat-footed 24	161	11	9	0				30 ft.	4 tentacles +19 (1d8+10/19-20 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	constrict (1d8+10), sucking maws, trample (1d8+15, DC 27)	Str 30, Dex 17, Con 24, Int 16, Wis 19, Cha 21	10	+1 (+5 grapple)	13 (can't be tripped)	AP 46	Sucking Maws (Su) A dark young of Shub-Niggurath that successfully pins a creature it is grappling automatically inflicts 1d4 points of Strength drain on that creature. A DC 24 Fortitude save reduces this effect to 1 point of Strength drain. A creature drained to 0 Strength does not die, but must make a DC 24 Will save at that point to resist being driven mad by the experience, as the foul green waste exuded from the same sucking mouths that drink life implant in the emptied shells strange visions and horrifying certainties. If you use the GameMastery Guide in your game, this madness manifests as schizophrenia, but with a save DC equal to the dark young's Strength drain save DC listed above (DC 24 for most dark young). One common result of this unfortunate madness is a strange desire to return to the site of their original encounter in hopes of being consumed entirely by the creature that only drank a part of their body and mind-many of those who survive this horrific ordeal go on to found dark young cults of their own. If you don't use the GameMastery Guide in your game, treat this madness instead as an insanity spell. The madness element of a dark young's sucking maws is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC for all of the saving throws involved with this special ability is Constitution-based.																												
Death Naga	12.00	19200	Large	3	24, touch 18, flat-footed 16	85	8	9	4	infernal blessing			40 ft.	bite +15 (1d8+4), sting +12 (2d4+4 plus poison)		10 ft.	5 ft.

The blast deals 12d6 points of unholy and negative energy damage (half of each). In addition, those within the cone gain one negative level. A Refl ex DC 22 save halves the damage and prevents the negative level. Undead remain unharmed within the cone but gain 2d4x5 temporary hit points for 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Infernal Blessing (Su) A death naga adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her armor class.  Naga Venin Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save DC 20 Fort; frequency 1 round (2d4 rounds); effect 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Spells Death nagas cast spells as 9th-level sorcerers with access to the divine domains of Death and Destruction as sorcerer spells.

Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. A creature reduced to Strength 0 by a demonic knight dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid slain by a demonic knight's breath of unlife becomes a shadow demon in 2d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the demonic knight that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.																												
Derghodaemon	12.00	19200	Large	5	27, touch 14, flat-footed 22	161	15	14	8		23		40 ft.	5 claws +21 (1d6+8/19-20)		10 ft.	10 ft.	rend (2 claws, 1d8+12 plus 2 Con damage)	Str 27, Dex 20, Con 22, Int 7, Wis 17, Cha 16	14	13	26	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Feeblemind Aura (Su) By grinding and clicking its mandibles and chitinous plates together (a free action), a derghodaemon can affect all creatures within 30 feet as if by a feeblemind spell. Daemons are immune to this effect, but all other creatures must make a DC 20 Will save to resist the effects. A creature that makes this save is immune to the effect for 24 hours. A creature that fails remains affected as long as the derghodaemon continues to maintain the aura and the subject remains within 30 feet of the derghodaemon. Once either condition ends, the victim of this effect can attempt a new DC 20 Will save once per minute to recover from the effect; otherwise, it can be cured by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. A derghodaemon cannot use its spell-like abilities or rend attack in any round in which it uses its feeblemind aura. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Swarmwalking (Su) A derghodaemon is immune to damage or distraction effects caused by swarms.																												
Diplodocus	12.00	19200	Colossal	6	25, touch 4, flat-footed 23	190	17	14	4				30 ft.	2 tail lashes +22 (4d6+15/19-20)		30 ft.	60 ft.	trample (2d8+22, DC 35)	Str 40, Dex 14, Con 21, Int 2, Wis 17, Cha 11	15	8	20	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Tail Lash (Ex) The diplodocus prefers to attack with its tail. The dinosaur can snap its incredibly long tail with surprising speed like an enormous whip-this is a primary attack that deals bludgeoning and slashing damage. A diplodocus can make two separate attacks with its tail lash as a full-attack action.																												
Dretch Megaswarm	12.00	19200	Small	4	15, touch 12, flat-footed 13	136	14	7	9	half damage from piercing weapons			20 ft.	swarm (6d6)		10 ft.	0 ft.	distraction (DC 20), feral rage, smite good	Str 12, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 11, Cha 11	16	9	21 (33 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Feral Rage (Ex) Dretch megaswarms attack in a mindless mob intent only tearing apart those that fall into their clutches. This frenzy prevents them from using any of their regularly-available spell-like or summoning abilities. However, the wild abandon of their attack allows them to deal 6d6 points of damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move rather than the 4d6 typical for a swarm of their HD. This ability is lost if the swarm is broken up.  Megaswarm Traits (Ex) Megaswarms are not so called because of the size of the swarm but rather the size of the creatures that compose the swarm. Unlike normal swarms, megaswarms are composed of Small creatures which are usually a megafauna version of a normal swarm and otherwise behave in a swarmlike manner. There are usually around 100 creatures in a megaswarm. The net effect is that they take only half damage from piercing weapons but take normal damage from other weapons. In addition when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or lower and breaks up, unless the damage was dealt by area-affecting attacks, then 2d6 surviving members of the megaswarm continue their attack, though now only as individual creatures. Otherwise, a megaswarm conforms to all of the other swarm traits as described in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.  Smite Good (Su) The collective chaos and evil concentrated in the existence of a dretch megaswarm allows the swarm deal extra damage equal to its HD (+16) once per day against a good foe. This ability is lost if the swarm is broken up.

Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals. Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals. Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Elder Positive Energy Elemental	12.00	19200	Huge	14	27, touch 19, flat-footed 16	152	9	19	10				fly 60 ft. (good)	2 slams +25 (2d8+6 plus 2d8 positive energy)		15 ft.	15 ft.	blinding flash (DC 22), channel positive energy 5/day (8d6, DC 20), death throes (50 ft. radius, DC 22, 8d8 positive energy damage), positive energy	Str 22, Dex 31, Con 18, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 11	16	24	45	Tome of Horrors Complete	Blinding Flash (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a positive energy elemental of at least Medium size can release a burst of pure energy in a 10-foot radius. Creatures viewing this burst must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. See the table below for the save DC for each positive energy elemental's blinding flash. The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Throes (Su) A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura). Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's positive energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's positive energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. All creatures in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC as the elemental's positive energy save DC) or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Positive Energy (Ex) A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with positive energy. This deals extra damage to an undead or negative energy based target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) by the same amount. Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of positive energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each positive energy elemental's save DC. Positive energy (such as a cure spell or positive energy channeling) can heal positive energy elementals. Positive Energy Aura (Su) A positive energy elemental radiates an aura of pure positive energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the positive energy channeling ability of the positive energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other positive energy elementals. Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy, including inflict spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Positive Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger positive energy elemental can channel positive energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Evaluator Robot	12.00	19200	Medium	9	27, touch 15, flat-footed 22	158	5	10	10	hardness 10		vulnerable to critical hits and electricity	50 ft., fly 120 ft.

All damage dealt to an evaluator robot with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the evaluator robot is immune to critical hits. An evaluator robot's force field has fast healing 10, but once these hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex) An evaluator robot has a built-in laser rifle. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 4d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through force fields and force effects, such as a wall of force, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other  clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment.  Memory Wipe (Ex) As a standard action, an evaluator robot can make a touch attack that, if it hits, injects nanites into a target and erases the last 12 hours of its memories. A successful DC 19 Will save negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Intelligence-based.  Process Languages (Ex) Exceptional processing and data stores allows an evaluator robot to parse language in a way that lets it permanently speak and understand any spoken or written language it observes for at least 1 minute.  Stun (Ex) An evaluator robot's melee attacks deliver a nonlethal jolt of electricity with each strike. If the robot strikes a creature twice in one round with its bastard sword or slam attack, that target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  Superior Optics (Ex) An evaluator robot can see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.

Fossil Golem	12.00	19200	Huge	1	26, touch 9, flat-footed 25	122	5	6	5				30 ft.	2 bites +20 (6d6+7 plus petrification)		15 ft.	15 ft.		Str 25, Dex 13, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 1	15	24	35	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Immunity to Magic (Su) A fossil golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A transmute rock to mud spell slows a fossil golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  • A stone to flesh spell negates its damage reduction and petrification ability for 1 round.  Petrification (Su) The attacks of a fossil golem gradually turn living flesh to stone. Each time the golem hits a target with one of its natural attacks, the target must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by this attack turns completely to stone, as if by a flesh to stone spell. Casting stone to flesh on the creature removes all Dexterity drain caused by this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Any creature that attacks a frost worm with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of cold damage per successful hit. A creature that grapples or is grappled by a frost worm takes 4d6 points of cold damage per round the grapple is maintained.  Death Throes (Su) When killed, a frost worm explodes in a 100-foot-radius burst that deals 12d6 cold damage and 8d6 piercing damage (DC 23 Reflex half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Trill (Su) As a full-round action, a frost worm can emit a strange trilling sound that affects all creatures within a 100-foot radius.  Creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be fascinated for as long as the worm continues to trill (the frost worm can maintain this trill by concentrating). Once a creature has resisted or broken the effect, it cannot be affected again by that same frost worm's trill for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Giant Bog Turtle	12.00	19200	Huge	4	26, touch 8, flat-footed 26	184	15	10	6	shell			30 ft., swim 40 ft.	bite +27 (3d8+18/19-20 plus grab)		15 ft.	10 ft.	capsize, current, swallow whole (3d8+18 crushing damage plus 8 acid damage, AC 19, 18 hp)	Str 34, Dex 10, Con 21, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 10	16	+30 (+34 grapple)	40 (44 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Capsize (Ex) A giant bog turtle can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.  For each size category the ship is larger than the bog turtle's size, the giant bog turtle takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.  Current (Ex) As a full round action, a giant bog turtle can induce a strong current by opening its mouth and inhaling large quantities of water. This strong rush of water lasts for 5 rounds and affects all in a cone-shaped area to a range of 100 feet.  Creatures and objects of up to Large size are pulled toward the bog turtle at the rate of 20 feet per round. Affected creatures can make a Swim check (DC 30) to resist the current. A swimming creature cannot take 10 on its Swim check. The check DC is Strength-based.  Shell (Ex) If it is severely threatened a giant bog turtle can completely withdraw into its shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When withdrawn, a giant bog turtle gains the benefit of cover (+4 AC against melee and ranged attacks). Since it cannot move when withdrawn into its shell, a bog turtle does not gain the +2 bonus to Reflex saves normally granted by cover.

For each size category the ship is larger than the sea slug's size, the sea slug takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.

Reflective Hide (Ex) Any mundane or magical light source brought within 30 feet of a glass wyrm causes the light to be reflected as a burst that blinds all creatures within 30 feet for 1d6+4 rounds. A creature can attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save to negate the blinding effect. This otherwise operates like a gaze attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spell Reflection (Ex) Any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance and targets a glass wyrm (or includes it in its area of effect) is reflected back on the caster if the glass wyrm successfully resists the spell or effect. The original caster becomes the spell's target (or its point of origin in the case of area spells). A reflected spell can be resisted normally by the caster (and any other creatures affected). A glass wyrm cannot reflect a sonic-based spell or spell-like ability, even if it allows resistance.																												
Great Cyclops	12.00	19200	Huge	1	26, touch 9, flat-footed 25	195	12	6	14				50 ft.

When it does, it doubles the threat range of all weapons, natural attacks, and rock attacks it makes until the start of its next turn. Furthermore, once per day, when the great cyclops reaches 0 or fewer hit points and is conscious because of its Diehard feat, this ability recharges, allowing it to use the ability a second time that same day.																												
Heresy Devil	12.00	19200	Huge	3	29, touch 7, flat-footed 29	175	17	3	13		22		10 ft., fly 40 ft.

This extraordinary bulk provides them with a +10 bonus on their combat maneuver defense. Blasphemous Bile (Su) 30-ft. line, once every 1d4 hours; damage 4d6 acid, Reflex DC 23 half. Those struck by this bile find themselves drenched in liquid corruption so profound it impedes the power of non-evil divine magic for 10 minutes. Any non-evil divine spellcaster who casts a spell targeting a creature soaked in an ayngavhaul's bile must make a DC 23 caster level check or have the spell fail. A creature affected by this bile may wash off the sludge by spending a round and using at least a gallon of fluid to cleanse itself. The save DC is Constitution-based. Devil Summoner (Su) Ayngavhauls know the secrets of all breeds of devils, utilizing such leverage in the summoning of their kind. Any devil within 30 feet of an ayngavhaul has half again the normal chance of having a fiend respond to its summon devil ability. For example, an osyluth's usual 35% chance to summon another bone devil increases to 52% when within 30 feet of an ayngavhaul. Summoning bonuses provided by multiple ayngavahuls do not stack. Ayngavahuls are immune to this ability, from both themselves and others of their kind. Searing Word (Su) An ayngavhaul can speak words of torment, giving them shape and sending them streaking toward their enemies in the form of diabolical sigils. Any good-aligned creature struck by one of these infernal words takes 3d6 points of hellfire damage (half fire, half evil energy); nongood creatures take half damage. These words cannot affect creatures affected by protection from evil or within an area of magical silence. Summon Devil (Sp) Once per day an ayngavhaul can attempt to summon 2d6 imps, 1d4 bearded devils, or 2 bone devils with an 80% chance of success, or a contract devil (see Pathfinder Adventure Path volume #12) with a 45% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Throne of Skulls (Su) All ayngavhauls hover upon fearsome infernal thrones. These thrones grant the devils their fly speed and a +4 armor bonus. Should an ayngavhaul be grappled or knocked down, it is unseated from its throne and loses these benefits. An ayngavhaul has telepathic command over its throne and may call its conveyance back and reseat itself as a full-round action.

This does not break the hetkoshu's grapple.  Hold Breath (Ex) A hetkoshu can hold its breath for 4 rounds per point of Constitution before having to make Constitution checks to continue holding its breath (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445).  Savage Rush (Ex) For 1 round per minute, a hetkoshu may sprint with devastating speed, increasing its land speed to 40 feet and allowing it to treat nonmagical difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain. If it charges during this round, it may attack twice with its bite as its attack action, using the same attack modifier for both attacks.

On a successful critical hit, that claw deals 2d6 bleed damage rather than 1d6.  Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an eremite's unnerving gaze becomes staggered for 1 round as it becomes convinced that it recognizes some of its own body parts entangled in the interlocutor's body.

Spider Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, save that it works only on spiders. A jorogumo uses her Hit Dice (normally 14) as her effective druid level. Spiders are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the  jorogumo to train them and use them as guardians (though it does not grant them skills or feats).  Spider Legs (Ex) A jorogumo's spider legs can emerge or retract as a free action. When a jorogumo's spider legs are present, she gains a +8 circumstance bonus on Climb checks and gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat.  Swift Shapechanger (Ex) A jorogumo can assume spider or human form as a swift action.

Detect Gems (Sp) A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones.  Fast Flight (Ex) A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed.  Weakening Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).

Dogmatic Discordance (Su)Good or evil creatures take a -2 penalty when making saving throws against a sovereign dragon's spells, spell-like abilities, breath weapon, and aura. Violent Retort (Ex)When a young or older sovereign dragon takes damage from a melee attack critical hit, it can, as an immediate action, make a claw or tail slap attack against the creature that made the critical hit.																												
Kokogiak	12.00	19200	Huge	1	25, touch 9, flat-footed 24	172	15	10	9				40 ft., burrow 20 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.	bite +23 (2d6+10 plus pull), 6 claws +24 (2d6+10/19-20)		15 ft.	10 ft.

Str 31, Dex 13, Con 22, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 16	15	27	38 (54 vs. trip)	AP 69	Blizzard Breath (Su) A kokogiak's breath weapon is a polar gale so bitterly cold that it saps vigor from those it touches. Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a kokogiak can expel a 60-foot cone of blistering arctic winds, dealing 8d6 points of cold damage to all creatures struck. A successful DC 23 Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature damaged by this attack must then succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become fatigued (or exhausted if it was already fatigued). The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Forlorn Gaze (Su) As a standard action, a kokogiak can lock its black eyes on a target within 60 feet to fascinate the creature. A successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Creatures that fail the save are fascinated and they see they kokogiak as a lost loved one, trusted friend in danger, or ally in desperate need. Once a creature is fascinated, the kokogiak can compel the creature to move toward it. Once adjacent, the creature is flat-footed against the kokogiak's attacks, but the creature receives a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break the fascination. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Ice Walker (Ex) A kokogiak takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions. It can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. In addition, a kokogiak can choose to not leave tracks when moving in this type of terrain.  Penetrating Sight (Ex) A kokogiak's sight is not affected by its own fog cloud or solid fog spell-like abilities. In addition, a kokogiak does not take any penalties on Perception checks while its snowing.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A kokogiak can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.

Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals leonal's HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a leonal's stat block.  Roar (Su) Up to three times per day, a leonal can emit a powerful roar as a standard action. Each roar affects a 60- foot cone with the effects of a holy word spell and also deals 2d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures in the area (DC 21 Fortitude negates). This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This effect even influences undead creatures despite their usual immunity to mind-affecting effects. When a lorelei murmurs, all creatures aside from other lorelei within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 20 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same lorelei's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the murmur moves toward the lorelei using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Affected creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the lorelei simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues for as long as the lorelei murmurs and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/ round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Vortex (Su) A lorelei can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 306), but can form only underwater and cannot leave the water. A creature must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or be snared by the churning waters. The vortex is 20 feet across and 80 feet deep, and deals 2d8+9 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence. Speak with Reptiles (Sp) A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals. Swamp Stride (Ex) A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. Water Breathing (Ex) A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

This functions as gust of wind, but any creature in its path must make a Fortitude save (DC 23) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand.  Move Sand (Su) A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell.  Sleep Breath (Su) Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a 40 ft. cone of sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+7 rounds.

The ash provides the giant with 50% concealment against ranged attacks. Strong wind or fire-quenching magic disperse it for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Fire Vortex (Su) A mythic fire giant can expend one use of mythic power to create a vortex of fire within 30 feet. The vortex is 5 feet wide at its base, 15 feet wide at the top, and 30 feet tall. Any creature starting its turn adjacent to the vortex takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and any creature passing through it takes 15d6 fire damage. A successful DC 23 Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The fire giant can move the vortex up to 20 feet as a move action. If the vortex moves through a creature, that creature must succeed at a saving throw against the vortex to avoid taking damage. The vortex lasts for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Lava Weapons (Su) All melee and ranged attacks made by the fire giant deal an additional 4d6 points of fire damage. This ability replaces the heated rock ability of non-mythic fire giants.

It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. When a rakshasa uses this ability, it always functions as if it had spent 3 rounds concentrating and thus gains the maximum amount of information possible. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 20 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Modify Memory (Sp) A mythic rakshasa can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to modify the memory of a creature whose mind it is reading, as the modify memory spell (CL 18th). The creature can resist with a successful DC 20 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Telepathic Dodge (Su) A mythic rakshasa gains an insight bonus to its AC against creatures whose minds it can read. It doesn't need to use its detect thoughts ability to gain this bonus. The rakshasa doesn't gain this bonus against creatures that are mindless or whose minds can't be read (such as from a mind blank spell).

(perfect)	3 tendrils +20 (2d8/19-20 plus energy drain)		10 ft.	10 ft.	energy drain (1 level, DC 23), kiss of the void	Str -, Dex 25, Con 22, Int 9, Wis 15, Cha 24	13	21	39	AP 84	Aura of Alien Dread (Su) A neshmaal's presence is deeply disturbing. Any creature that comes within 20 feet of a neshmaal must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. If a creature is within the auras of multiple neshmaals, only a single save is required, but the save DC increases by 2 for each additional neshmaal (for example, the presence of two neshmaals increases the usual save DC to 25). Arcane spellcasters are especially vulnerable to this aura. The DC to cast spells defensively within the aura increases by 4, and the neshmaal can make an attack of opportunity against an arcane caster who fails to cast defensively. This secondary effect occurs even if the arcane caster succeeded at her save against the shaken condition. Once a creature is exposed to a neshmaal's aura, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  Dominate Person (Sp) A neshmaal can dominate only one target at a time when using its dominate person spell-like ability. If a neshmaal uses its dominate person spell-like ability on a new target while already dominating another creature, the previous target is immediately released from the neshmaal's control. This occurs whether or not the new attempt is successful.  Kiss of the Void (Su) Three times per day, a neshmaal may forgo using energy drain on one of its three tendril attacks in a round and instead imbue the touch with the icy coldness of deep space. This attack deals an additional 6d6 points of cold damage and paralyzes the target for 1d4-1 rounds. A successful DC 23 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Vulnerability to Sonic (Su) Neshmaals are native to the noiseless void of deep space or their own alien dimension and, as a result, are especially vulnerable to sonic damage. Magical attacks that cause sonic damage bypass the neshmaal's spell resistance, and they take half again as much damage (+50%) on a failed save (normal full damage on a successful save). If a neshmaal fails a saving throw against an effect that deals sonic damage, it has a 25% chance of being stunned for 1 round.

Full details on nightshade traits can be found on page 308 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2.  Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Charisma damage and 2d6 cold damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Umbral Web (Su) A nightskitter can weave semisolid webs out of shadowstuff. These webs are not strong enough to bear any but the lightest weight. A nightskitter can use these umbral webs in two different ways, as detailed below.  Attacking: Up to eight times per day, a nightskitter can hurl a mass of umbral webs at a target. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 100 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the nightskitter. An entangled creature gains 1d4 temporary negative levels while entangled, and can attempt to escape with a successful DC 28 Escape Artist check, or may try to burst the web with a DC 28 Strength check. The negative levels granted by an umbral web vanish as soon as the entangled character escapes from the web.  Multiple umbral webs can entangle a single foe-the DCs to escape do not increase, but the temporary negative levels they cause stack. A creature that gains a total number of negative levels equal to its Hit Dice is immediately slain.  Warding: By encasing all surfaces of an enclosed area, such as a cavern or a room, with thick layers of umbral webs, a nightskitter can infuse that area with necromantic energy. A chamber warded by umbral webs is treated as if under the effects of an unhallow spell with a deeper darkness spell fixed to the effect. A single nightskitter can maintain one such infused area at a time, to a maximum size of one 20-foot cube per Hit Die possessed by the nightskitter. Maintaining an umbral web ward does not limit its use of these webs to attack.

Slime (Su) An omox's nauseating body is composed of sticky, acidic slime. As an attack action, it can hurl a glob of slime (range increment 20 feet). Any creature that is struck by the glob must make a DC 23 Reflex save or become entangled for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Smothering (Ex) An omox can use its grab ability against a creature of any size. When it grabs a foe, it attempts to flow over and into the victim's mouth and nose to smother it. Each round the omox maintains its grapple, its victim cannot breathe or speak. See page 445 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for rules on how long a victim can hold its breath and the consequences of suffocation.

This effect is identical to a phantasmal killer spell (caster level 13th) except it affects all creatures within 30 feet rather than just a single target and deals 6d6 points of damage (rather than 3d6 like the spell) on a successful Fortitude save. The Will save has a DC of 21and the Fortitude save has a DC of 21. A creature that succeeds on its Will save is immune to the phantasmagoria attack of that phasma for 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Wisdom Drain (Su) A phasma feeds on the mental strength of its enemies. Its incorporeal touch deals 1d6 points of Wisdom drain each time one of its attacks hits. On each successful attack, a phasma gains 5 temporary hit points.

Reclamation Robot	12.00	19200	Large	11	27, touch 16, flat-footed 20	168	7	12	7	hardness 10		vulnerable to critical hits and electricity	30 ft., climb 20 ft.	5 claws +21 (1d6+6/19-20 plus grab)	integrated laser rifle +22 touch (2d6 fire)	10 ft.	15 ft.	combined arms, constrict (1d6+6), efficient grappler	Str 22, Dex 25, Con -, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 1	16	+23 (+31 grapple, +27 sunder)	40 (48 vs. grapple, 42 vs. sunder, 44 vs. trip)	AP 88	Combined Arms (Ex) When taking a full-attack action, a reclamation robot can attack with its claws and its integrated laser rifle simultaneously. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity with its integrated laser rifle when using combined arms.  Efficient Grappler (Ex) A reclamation robot takes only a -10 penalty on its combat maneuver check to make and maintain a grapple on a foe when using only its claw rather than its whole body to grapple. It receives a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks to start and maintain a grapple rather than the normal +4 bonus granted by the grab ability. A reclamation robot can make an attack with its integrated laser rifle against one creature it is grappling as a swift action-when it attacks in this way, the robot has a threat range of 18-20 for critical hits with the laser rifle.  Item Creation (Ex) Reclamation robots are known for their startling creativity in repairing damaged technology. A reclamation robot ignores all of the item creation feat requirements for creating a technological item, but must have access to a sufficient amount of scrap metal and spare parts in order to create or repair an item (the robot must still expend materials equal to the item's cost). A reclamation robot can attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to restore a timeworn technological item to full functionality-the DC of this check is equal to the item's Craft DC + 5, and requires an expenditure of technological components worth a total amount of money equal to the timeworn item's cost (half the cost of the object in its pristine condition). Failure results in the destruction of the item. When a reclamation robot restores a technological  item to full functionality in this manner, if the robot exceeds its DC by a result of 10 or more, it improves the item in some way-choose one of the following improvements or determine one randomly.  • The item's capacity permanently increases by 50%.  • If the item is a weapon or armor, it becomes masterwork.  • The item becomes hardened (increase its hardness by 2).  • The item becomes fortified (increase its hit points by 50%).  • The item becomes lightweight (weight is divided in half).  Force Field (Ex) A reclamation robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants it 50 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a reclamation robot with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the reclamation robot is immune to critical hits. A reclamation robot's force field has fast healing 10, but once these hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex) A reclamation robot has a built-in laser rifle in its chest. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 2d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through force fields and force effects, such as a wall of force, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment.  Salvage (Ex) A reclamation robot is designed specifically to salvage technology for further use. All Craft skills are class skills for reclamation robots, and they gain a +4 racial bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks and gain Technologist as a bonus feat. A reclamation robot can repair 2d6 points of damage to a robot within reach (including itself) as a standard action.  Scaling (Ex) Reclamation robots are expected to work at great heights or while clinging to immense ships. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Climb checks. Once every 1d4 rounds, a reclamation robot can increase its climb speed to 40 feet as a swift action for 1 round.  Vulnerable to Critical Hits (Ex) Like all robots, reclamation robots are vulnerable to critical hits. In addition, when a critical hit is confirmed against a reclamation robot, roll a d8. On a roll of 1, instead of suffering additional damage from the critical hit, the robot suffers damage to essential processing units and memory modules that it cannot itself repair (although another reclamation robot could repair this damage). While such damage is not readily apparent on the exterior-and the robot itself is essentially  unaware of it-this kind of injury can have a number of different effects. When such an injury occurs, roll d% and consult the following chart to determine the nature of the damage.  d% Result  01-20 The robot takes a -4 penalty on all skill checks.  21-30 The robot's integrated laser rifle now glitches each time it is fired as if it were timewornTG.  31-40 The robot loses its scaling ability (including its bonus on Climb checks).  41-60 When it attempts to repair damage to a robot via salvage, it only repairs 1d4 points of damage.  61-70 Movement is reduced by 10 feet.  71-95 One of the robot's claw attacks becomes nonfunctional.  96-100 The robot goes berserk, functioning as if under the simultaneous effects of a confusion spell and a rage spell.

Those caught in the blast must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of fire damage and be dazed for 1 round and dazzled for an additional 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Rider's Robes (Su) The Red Rider wears robes that provide the same protection as half-plate armor.  Rider's Weapon (Su) Whenever the Red Rider successfully confirms a critical hit with his +2 f laming scimitar, the target is dazed for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 23 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Roper	12.00	19200	Large	5	27, touch 10, flat-footed 26	162	13	5	13		27	vulnerability to fire	10 ft.	bite +20 (4d8+18/19-20)	6 strands +10 touch (1d6 Strength)	10 ft.	10 ft.	pull (strand, 5 feet), strands	Str 34, Dex 13, Con 29, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 12	9	22	33 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary	Strands (Ex) A roper can extend up to six thin, sticky strands from its body at a time, launching them to a maximum range of 50 feet. A roper's attacks with its strands resolve as ranged touch attacks. These strands are quite strong, but can be severed by any amount of slashing damage (a strand is AC 20). A creature struck by a strand is numbed and weakened by the strange material, and must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same rusalka's beckoning call for 24 hours. When an affected creature begins its turn adjacent to the rusalka, it is dazed for that round. These effects continue as long as the rusalka takes a standard action to maintain the effect, plus 1 additional round. This is a  sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Staggering Touch (Su) A creature touched by a rusalka must make a DC 27 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by overwhelming feelings of desire and shame. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Tresses (Su) A rusalka's long hair is strong and capable of making powerful primary natural attacks. When it uses its tresses to grapple an opponent, a rusalka does not gain the grappled condition itself. In addition, a rusalka uses its Charisma modifier in addition to its Strength modifier for all combat maneuver checks made with its tresses.

Create Spawn (Su) When a sayona kills a humanoid or fey of Medium or Small size with its absorb blood or blood drain ability, the victim rises 24 hours later as a ghoul with the advanced creature simple template and the blood drain ability. The spawn is the sayona's slave until its master is destroyed.   Living Form (Su) As a standard action, a sayona can transform into a young, beautiful person for 24 hours. It can only use this ability if it has absorbed or drained blood in the past hour. In this form, the sayona has the aura of a living creature instead of an undead (for the purpose of detect undead and similar effects), its fast healing increases to 10, positive energy attacks (such as channel energy) deal half damage to it, and it cannot use its fear cone or gaze attack. Exposure to holy water or positive energy attacks in this form reduces the duration of this transformation by 1d4 hours.  Staggering Gaze (Su) Staggered for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 23 negates. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or thin streams of blood pour from their eyes, flowing through the air and into the eye socket-like pits in the scarlet walker's face. This does not impact the victim's vision, but does deal 1 point of Constitution damage and sickens the victim for 1 round from the hideous pain. A creature already suffering from a bleed effect takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw. This is a bleed effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Bloodsense (Su) A scarlet walker can sense living creatures with blood in their veins, or undead creatures that feed on blood (such as vampires). This ability functions like blindsight to a range of 60 feet.																												
Sea Serpent	12.00	19200	Gargantuan	6	25, touch 8, flat-footed 23	187	16	13	7	elusive			20 ft., swim 60 ft.	bite +23 (4d8+22/19-20 plus grab), tail slap +18 (3d6+6 plus grab)		20 ft.	20 ft.	capsize, constrict (3d6+18), swallow whole (4d8+18 bludgeoning damage, AC 18, hp 18)	Str 34, Dex 14, Con 25, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 11	15	+31 (+35 grapple)	43 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary	Capsize (Ex) A sea serpent can attempt to capsize a boat or ship of its size or smaller by ramming it as a charge attack and making a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. Elusive (Su) Sea serpents have long been the stuff of maritime legends, but despite countless attempts to hunt them, they are rarely encountered unless they wish it. As a fullround action while in water, a sea serpent can move up to its run speed (300 ft.) without leaving any trace of its passing (identical in effect to a pass without trace). An elusive sea serpent gains a +40 circumstance bonus to its Stealth check. In addition, except when in combat, a sea serpent is considered to be under the effects of a nondetection spell. Both of these spell effects are at caster level 20th and cannot be dispelled.																												
Shenzuzhou	12.00	19200	Large	3	27, touch 12, flat-footed 24	127	8	10	12	channel resistance +4	23		30 ft.	#ERROR!		10 ft.	10 ft.	festering heads	Str 28, Dex 17, Con -, Int 6, Wis 15, Cha 17	12	22	35	The Ruby Phoenix Tournament	Festering Heads (Su) Once the heads in a shenzuzhou's collection rot out naturally, it can hurl them as a thrown splash weapon (range increment 30 ft.) as a standard action. A thrown head ruptures on impact, releasing noxious gas that produces an effect identical to a stinking cloud spell (DC 22). The save is Charisma-based. A typical shenzuzhou carries 1d4 festering heads. The heads do not rupture if thrown by another creature.																												
Shining Child	12.00	19200	Medium	7	28, touch 21, flat-footed 24	152	14	10	10				30 ft., fly 50 ft.

Str 10, Dex 17, Con 18, Int 15, Wis 11, Cha 24	16	16	37	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Blinding Light (Ex) A shining child can radiate a 60-foot-radius aura of blinding light as a free action. Creatures within the affected area must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same shining child's aura for 24 hours. The save is Constitution-based.  Burning Touch (Su) A shining child corrupts the positive energy within a living creature into an unnatural burning light. For the next 5 rounds after a successful touch attack by a shining child, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage. The burning light can be "extinguished" by casting darkness or deeper darkness on the target, or by entering an area of natural darkness (not counting the light from the burning target).  Radiant Armor (Su) The light that surrounds a shining child grants a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus. The bonus is negated as long as the shining child is in the area of effect of a spell with the darkness descriptor that is at least 3rd level.  Searing Ray (Su) A shining child's primary attack is a ray of searing light. This attack has a range of 120 feet. The ray deals double damage to undead creatures.

Whenever a shira hits with a coup de grace attack using its bite, or confirms a critical hit with its claws or bite, the target must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain. The save is Constitution-based.  Dusty Pelt (Ex) A shira collects and produces copious amounts of dust and ash within the coarse hairs of its furry hide. As a move action, it can shake itself, creating a cloud of dust that fills its space, providing it concealment. Any attack that deals at least 10 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to the shira (before DR) automatically activates this ability. The dust cloud lasts for 1 round. A light wind disperses this cloud immediately.

The cloud provides concealment and any creature in the area or entering the area must make a successful DC 24 Fortitude save or be sickened for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Jet (Ex) A shrroth can jet backward once per round as a full-round action at a speed of 240 feet. It must move in a straight line, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.

A successful DC 26 Reflex save halves the initial damage and negates all ongoing damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Resistant Evolution (Su) Somalcygots have evolved in the harsh, unforgiving vacuum of space and developed fortified resistances to the myriad threats found in their environment, granting them a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

Str 13, Dex 13, Con -, Int 20, Wis 10, Cha 13	15	16	27	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Cemented Mind (Ex) A soulbound shell can never change its known or prepared spells.  Soul Focus (Su) The soul bound to the shell lives within a gem inside its chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another shell, at the same cost as creating a new soulbound shell, and retains its personality and memories. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.  Spells A spellbound shell casts spells as a 12th-level cleric, witch, or wizard, but does not gain any other class abilities.  Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) A soulbound shell is not immune to mind-affecting effects.

Spit (Ex) A spitting eurypterid can expel a high-pressure jet of water from a vent just below its mouth with startling accuracy and force. This spit attack is equally effective above or below water, creating a 40-foot line that inflicts 10d6 points of nonlethal damage to all creatures in the area of effect. In addition, creatures that take damage from this jet of water are stunned for 1 round. A DC 25 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. Once a spitting eurypterid uses this ability, it cannot use it again until it takes a full-round action while completely submerged to draw more water into its body. The save DC is Constitution-based.

These spirits provide a +4 deflection bonus to AC, immunity to enchantment and illusion spells, and one of the following spell effects: bless, endure elements, protection from evil, protection from good, or see invisibility. The effects of a spirit summoning persist for 24 hours.																												
Time Flayer	12.00	19200	Medium	6	28, touch 18, flat-footed 28	110	9	12	0	foresight			40 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	temporal displacement, unmaking	Str 19, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 20, Wis 20, Cha 19	13	-1	4 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Foresight (Su) A time flayer can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents a time flayer from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time flayer an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time flayer can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time flayers are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Reality Bend (Su) As a free action, a time flayer can fold the dimensional space surrounding it so its true location is hard to discern. Attackers have a 50% miss chance each time they attack with melee or ranged weapons. This is similar to the miss chance granted by a displacement spell. See invisibility does not reveal the creature's location, but true seeing does. Temporal Displacement (Su) As a melee touch attack, a time flayer can send a creature a few seconds into the future. A DC 18 Fortitude save negates. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. This effectively removes that creature from combat for the duration. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it suffers no damage and is shunted aside. The time flayer can use this ability three times per day. Time Jaunt (Su) As a standard action, a time flayer can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time flayer and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius that the time flayer designates. Unwilling creatures can attempt a DC 18 Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the greater teleport spell. The save DC is Constitution-based. Unmaking (Su) An opponent slain by a time flayer is unmade-erased from the very fabric of time. No memories or recollections of the unmade creature exist anywhere in reality. Past events the creature was responsible for are now attributed to an unknown-even if they recently took place. For example, suppose a great hero saved a kingdom from certain doom and then suffers the unmaking. The kingdom is still safe, but no one can quite recall who saved it. A creature that suffers the unmaking cannot be raised, resurrected, or restored to life by any means-not even a wish can restore an unmade creature. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore one who suffers this fate.																												
Tobongo	12.00	19200	Gargantuan	-1	27, touch 5, flat-footed 27	175	17	3	3	plant traits		vulnerability to fire	40 ft.	2 slams +19 (4d6+12/19-20 plus grab)	rock +6 (4d6+18)	20 ft.	20 ft.	curse of barkflesh, rock throwing (240 ft.), shake the earth, trample (4d6+18, DC 29)	Str 35, Dex 8, Con 26, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 18	10	9	21 (29 vs. trip)	Heart of the Jungle	Animate Trees (Sp) A tobongo can animate any trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a standard treant, gaining the treant's vulnerability to fire (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the treant's animation and rock-throwing abilities). If the tobongo that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state. Curse of Barkflesh (Su) Following a successful grapple, a tobongo can dig its spiky branches into its victim, infecting him with a foul and potent curse. Unless he succeeds at a DC 20 Fortitude save, the victim's flesh immediately begins to harden and grow uncontrollably like tree bark, and he takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage per day until his Dexterity reaches 0. At this point, the victim turns entirely stiff, grows roots, and transforms into a new, unintelligent tree, preventing any form of resurrection short of wish or miracle. The effect can be slowed by pruning the victim once per hour, slicing off the strange growths. Pruning inflicts 1d6 points of damage on the victim, but it negates the need to make a new Fortitude save. If the victim goes without pruning for more than an hour, the barkflesh takes over and he must immediately make the Fortitude save for the day or suffer the Dexterity damage. The save DC is Wisdom-based. Curse of Barkflesh: Grapple- injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/ day; effect 1d4 Dex damage, when Dex reaches 0, target transforms into a tree. Double Damage Against Objects (Ex) A tobongo or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. Shake the Earth (Ex) A rooted tobongo can, as a full-round action, uproot itself, buckling the surrounding earth in a 60-foot radius. Living creatures within the radius must make a DC 29 Reflex save or fall prone and take 1d6 points of damage. Man-made structures within the area of effect must make a DC 29 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of structural damage. Once uprooted, the tobongo cannot use this action again until it re-roots itself. It takes the creature at least 1 hour to root effectively. The save DC is Strength-based. Treespeech (Ex) A tobongo has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet it with an attitude of friendly or helpful.

Str 32, Dex 17, Con 26, Int 13, Wis 19, Cha 14	9	+11 (+15 grapple)	23	AP 94	Corpse Stitcher (Sp) Tomb giants can cast make whole as a spell-like ability, but only for the purposes of creating undead creatures. For example, a tomb giant can use this ability to aid in the creation of a necrocraft (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 200), to restore armor to be used for the creation of a phantom armor (Bestiary 4 213), or even to repair the armor of a graveknight (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 138).  Energy Drain (Su) A tomb giant can channel its energy drain attack through any melee weapon it wields.  Sinister Synergy (Su) Multiple tomb giants can combine their efforts to gain the ability to create undead. When two or more tomb giants are within 30 feet of each other, they can work together to use create undead as a spell-like ability (caster level 13th). Three or more tomb giants working in unison in this way can use greater create undead as a spell-like ability (caster level 15th). Every additional tomb giant beyond the third who participates in this synergy increases the caster level of this effect by 1.

This acts as a suggestion spell, but the umdhlebi can only compel this one action. A creature that makes a DC 20 Will save is unaffected, and is immune to the same umdhlebi's compelling whisper for 24 hours. An umdhlebi can also use this ability on creatures it is grappling, increasing the DC to 25. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Treacherous Ground (Ex) The mass of gnashing roots and stems at the base of an umdhlebi's trunk are constantly in motion. As a result, all squares within 5 feet of the umdhlebi's space are treated as difficult terrain for the purposes of movement through the area.  Writhing Tendrils (Ex) All umdhlebis have eight tendrils, but the creature can only make 2 slam attacks in a single round.  However, an umdhlebi can continue to make 2 slam attacks even while its other tendrils are grappling or constricting.  An umdhlebi can use this ability as long as it has two or more tendrils free to attack.

Choose the Slain (Su) A valkyrie can draw the soul from a newly dead body and store it in her spear for transport to the Outer Planes. This functions as soul bind, but the dead creature must be willing to have its soul taken. If the creature is unwilling, this ability has no effect.  Holy Zeal (Su) A valkyrie adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.																												
Vespergaunt	12.00	19200	Medium	6	20, touch 12, flat-footed 18	195	14	9	9	amorphous,	23	light sensitivity	10 ft., fly 60 ft. (perfect)	2 slams +21 (2d8+8 plus siphon spirit)		5 ft.	10 ft.		Str 27, Dex 14, Con 24, Int 15, Wis 15, Cha 16	12	20	32 (can't be tripped)	Inner Sea Bestiary	Aura of Madness (Su) Any creature within a 60-foot radius of the vespergaunt must succeed at a DC 21 save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature successfully saves, it cannot be affected by the same vespergaunt's aura again for 24 hours. As a free action, the vespergaunt can suppress its aura. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Damage Reduction (Su) A vespergaunt's damage reduction is bypassed by any weapons that are chaos-, evil-, good-, or law-aligned.  Siphon Spirit (Su) Any creature touched by a vespergaunt must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or gain 1 negative level as the vespergaunt rips away a portion of its soul. A divine spellcaster gains an additional negative level with each failed save. The victim must save anew each time it is touched, and a character killed by this attack disintegrates completely except for its eyes and strands of brain matter, which become part of the vespergaunt. Only powerful magic such as miracle or wish can resurrect a creature slain in this manner.

Sacrilegious Aura (Sp) The overwhelming entropic energies and the sheer number of voidsticks animating the voidstick zombie warp and augment negative and positive energy around the creature. As with all voidsticks, an aura of intense negative energy extends in a 30-foot radius from the zombie functioning as the spell desecrate. Undead within this aura receive a +1 profane bonus on attack and damage rolls and the DC to resist channeled negative energy increases by +3. The voidstick zombie constantly gains the benefits of this effect (the attack and damage bonuses are already incorporated into its statistics).  In addition, this miasma of void energies also interferes with wielding positive energy. Any creature attempting to use positive energy in this area-such as through a cleric's channel energy ability, a paladin's lay on hands, or any spell with the healing descriptor-must make a DC 25 concentration check. If this check fails, the effect is blocked, consuming one use of the ability, or the spell is lost.

Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 21) or be destroyed.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.

Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.  Wave Mastery (Su) For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.

The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +9 racial bonus.  Demon-Souled (Ex) Bound demonic life force animates the viper, giving it the chaotic and evil subtypes.  Find Master (Su) As long as an abrakarn viper and its diadem are on the same plane, the viper can unerringly find the diadem's wearer (or just the diadem, if it is removed).  Guard (Ex) If so ordered, an abrakarn viper defends the wearer of the diadem. All attacks against the diadem's wearer take a -2 penalty when the wearer is within the viper's melee reach.  Poison (Ex) An abrakarn viper's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its body. The creator must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir holds enough poison for three successful bite attacks, after which the creature merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir with any injury poison (typically drow poison).  Shield Other (Sp) The wearer of an abrakarn viper's diadem can activate this ability as a standard action when within 100 feet of the viper. This ability transfers half the damage that would be dealt to the diadem's wearer to the viper (this ability does not provide the bonuses to AC or on saving throws granted by the spell of the same name). Damage transferred in this way bypasses any defensive abilities the viper possesses (such as immunity or damage reduction).

Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's breath weapon) or be destroyed. The save DC  is Charisma-based. Electricity Aura (Su) An adult blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Mirage (Su) An old or older blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage. Sandstorm (Su) As a standard action, a great wyrm blue dragon can create a sandstorm centered on itself with a radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the dragon inside the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition to the normal sandstorm penalties (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431). This sandstorm lasts for up to 1 hour, but can be dismissed by the dragon as a free action. Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A blue dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-ghost sound; Juvenile-minor image; Adult-ventriloquism; Old-hallucinatory terrain; Ancient- veil; Great wyrm-mirage arcana. Storm Breath (Su) An ancient or older blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions as call lightning storm, but the damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Additional uses of this ability extend the duration by an additional 1d6 rounds.

Electricity Aura (Su) An old or older bronze dragon has an aura of electricity. All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will. Repulsion Breath (Su) Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

Tidal Wave (Su) A great wyrm bronze dragon can cause the sea to rise up and crush his enemies once per day as a standard action. This affects an area of coastline 120 feet in length and targets all creatures within 40 feet of the shore-treat the targets as if struck by an avalanche (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 429). Treat all creatures as if they were in the bury zone. The save DC to halve this damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Those who fail their saves take full damage and are drawn 60 feet off shore and deposited 20 feet under the surface on the round after the wave hits. Vortex (Ex) Once per day, an ancient or older bronze dragon can create a vortex as a standard action, just like an elder water elemental (see page 127).

Alien Presence (Su) A lunar dragon's alien presence affects opponents that fail their saves as touch of idiocy (or as feeblemind for creatures with 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  Bewildering Breath (Su) A creature that fails its saving throw against a lunar dragon's breath weapon emits light (as faerie fire) and is dazzled for 1d4 rounds. If the lunar dragon is adult or older, the creature is also confused for 1d4 rounds.  Moonsilver (Ex) A lunar dragon's natural weapons are treated as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Alien Presence (Su) A void dragon's alien presence causes an opponent that fails its save to be overcome with dizziness, becoming sickened (or nauseated if the target has 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6 rounds.  Obliterate (Su) A young or older void dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage. A creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or be immediately slain and reduced to ashes (as the disintegrate spell). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Suffocating Breath (Su) Instead of dealing cold damage, a very young or older void dragon can breathe a cone-shaped suffocation effect. An air-dependent creature that fails its Fortitude save suffocates (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445) for a number of rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Void Gaze (Su) A creature within 30 feet of an adult or older void dragon must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d6 rounds. This gaze attack is a mind-affecting effect.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) An air elemental construct is immune to any spell or spelllike ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A control weather spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to an air elemental construct. The construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 17 + caster's relevant ability score modifier) for half damage. An iron body or ice storm spell slows (as the slow spell) an air elemental construct for 2d6 rounds. Note the iron body spell does not change the construct's form, nor does an ice storm spell actually damage the construct. A control winds spell heals an air elemental construct of all of its lost hit points. Insubstantial Form (Ex) An air elemental construct cannot run, wear armor, or enter water or other liquids. It can pass through holes and small openings-even cracks. It can also occupy spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a gaseous form spell-note the air elemental construct is not subject to wind effects like the gaseous form spell.) Any piercing or slashing attack against an air elemental construct has a 20% miss chance. Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally. Wind Blast (Ex) An air elemental construct can transform the air in radius around it into a forceful blast of wind and debris. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Shore Storming (Ex) An akhlut automatically transforms into an orca whenever it is fully immersed in water, losing its legs and fur.  Likewise, when an akhlut emerges from the water, it automatically transforms into its wolf-orca hybrid form.  If an akhlut moves from water to land (or vice versa) on the round before initiating combat, it gains a +8 bonus on its initiative check. This initial attack resolves as a charge.  An akhlut has the same statistics in both forms.  Snow Vision (Ex) An akhlut can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snowy weather.  Snow Walking (Su) An akhlut can walk on snow or thin sheets of ice as though affected by water walk. It only leaves a trail on such surfaces when it wants to.

Any creature in this area of effect must make a DC 24 Will save at the start of its turn to avoid falling under the effects of calm emotions for 1 round. Creatures that could be attracted to the alraune's current apparent gender take a -2 penalty on this Will save, while all other creatures gain a +2 bonus on the save. This is a mind-affecting effect.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Feed (Ex) An alraune's roots can feed on a helpless or willing target. At the end of an hour of feeding, the victim takes 1d6 points of both Constitution and Intelligence drain, and the alraune heals 3d6 points of damage.																												
Argus	13.00	25600	Gargantuan	#ERROR!	30, touch 12, flat-footed 28	184	10	6	9	absolute readiness, rock catching		vulnerable to fascination and sleep	40 ft.	2 claws +20 (3d6+14 plus grab), bite +19 (2d8+14)	rock +8 (3d6+14)	20 ft.	20 ft.	accurate strikes, constrict (3d6+14), eye gouge, fascinating gaze, mythic power (6/day, surge +1d8), rend (2 claws, 3d6+21), rock throwing (200 ft.)	Str 39, Dex 14, Con 23, Int 13, Wis 12, Cha 10	9	+27 (+31 grapple)	43	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Absolute Readiness (Ex) An argus is never surprised or flat-footed. It can act in the surprise round as if it were a normal round.  Accurate Strikes (Ex) An argus's attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by any cover less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by any concealment less than total concealment.  Eye Gouge (Ex) If an argus rends or pins an opponent, as a swift action it can attempt a dirty trick maneuver to blind the target. If its combat maneuver check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the opponent is permanently blinded.   Fascinating Gaze (Su) A creature within 40 feet of an argus must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or be fascinated for 5d6 rounds. If the creature has 4 or fewer Hit Dice, it is instead dazed for 5d6 rounds. An argus can't use this ability in the same round it uses frightful presence. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Limitless Vision (Ex) An argus takes no distance penalties on Perception checks.																												
Azruverda	13.00	25600	Huge	2	25, touch 10, flat-footed 23	168	11	7	15				50 ft., climb 30 ft.	bite +21 (2d6+11), 2 claws +21 (1d10+11)	acid spit +13 touch (10d6 acid)	15 ft.	15 ft.	acid spit, rend (1d10+11)	Str 32, Dex 15, Con 23, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 25	12	+25 (+29 bull rush)	37 (39 vs. bull rush, 45 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Acid Spit (Ex) An azruverda can spit a stream of acid at a target within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack that deals 10d6 points of acid damage.  Vermin Master (Su) An azruverda can mentally control to up to 32 HD (twice the azruverda's racial Hit Dice) of vermin at any one time through a combination of supernatural pheromones and magical manipulation. To control a vermin, the azruverda must be able to see it, and it must be within 120 feet. Attempting to control a vermin is a standard action-the vermin can resist this attempt with a DC 25 Will save. If the vermin fails this save, the azruverda can issue a simple mental command like "fight," "come here," "go there," or "stand still" as a swift action. Though composed of thousands of individuals, vermin with the swarm subtype are vulnerable to this ability as well. An azruverda can release a creature from this control as a free action. Vermin affected by this ability act normally unless an azruverda is actively controlling it, but never attack their master azruverda. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Banshee	13.00	25600	Medium	15	26, touch 26, flat-footed 14	161	10	19	18	incorporeal		sunlight powerlessness	fly 60 ft. (perfect)	incorporeal touch +26 (14d6 negative energy plus terror)		5 ft.	5 ft.	wail	Str -, Dex 32, Con -, Int 5, Wis 20, Cha 19	14	25	40	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Hear Heartbeat (Ex) A banshee can sense the beating hearts of living creatures within 60 feet, as if it had the blindsight ability.  Terror (Su) A creature damaged by the banshee's touch attack must make a DC 23 Will save.  Failure means that the victim cowers in fear for 1d3 rounds. If a target is protected against fear by a dispellable effect (such as heroes' feast or mind blank), the banshee's touch attempts to dispel one such effect with greater dispel magic (CL 14th). Negative energy damage caused by a banshee's touch can only harm the living; it cannot heal undead.  This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Wail (Su) Once per minute, a banshee may wail as a full-round action. The wail lasts until the beginning of her next turn. All creatures within 40 feet of the banshee when she begins her wail, as well as all creatures that end their turn within that radius, must make a DC 23 Fortitude save. (This save is only required once per wail.) Creatures under the effects of a fear effect take a -4 penalty on this save. Creatures that make their save are sickened for 1d6 rounds. Those that fail take 140 points of damage (as if affected by a CL 14 wail of the banshee). If a wailing banshee is damaged during a wail, she must make a Will save (DC 15 + damage taken) to maintain the wail; otherwise it ends. This is a sonic death effect. Banshee wails are supernaturally powerful, and penetrate the effect of any spell of 3rd level or lower that creates silence. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Battlehulk	13.00	25600	Huge	-4	27, touch 4, flat-footed 27	177	8	4	8		20		10 ft.	ram +38 (4d8+22) and 4 slams +38 (2d10+15)		15 ft.	5 ft. (10 ft. with slams)	bull rush, charge, ram, sweep, trample (8d8+44, DC 37)	Str 40, Dex 3, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	25	+42 (+46 bull rush)	48 (52 vs. bull rush, can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Bull Rush (Ex) If the battlehulk is charging it can opt to make a bull rush attack without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the bull rush is successful, the defender is automatically pushed back the distance that the battlehulk moves forward past his position. The battlehulk does not require a check result of 5 or more higher than the defender's check result to determine how far back the defender can be pushed. The battlehulk can bull rush as many opponents as occupy the squares in its path of travel with the usual -4 penalty to additional combat maneuver checks.  Charge (Ex) Each round a battlehulk double moves in a straight line, it adds an additional 10 ft. to its speed as its weight and inertia propel it forward. It can reach a maximum speed of 80 feet in this way. A battlehulk can stop after charging only by striking an unyielding obstacle (like a mountain) or by gradually slowing. It can reduce its speed by 10 feet per round as it slows its momentum. A battlehulk can only turn when going at a speed of 30 feet or less. If traveling downhill on a steep slope, the battlehulk accelerates twice as fast (i.e. it goes from 10 feet, to 30 feet, to 50 feet, etc.) and decelerate twice as slow (i.e. it takes 2 rounds to decelerate from 80 feet to 70 feet and so on). Likewise if traveling up hill on a steep slope it decelerates twice as fast and accelerates twice as slow.  Immunities (Ex) A battlehulk is immune to acid, cold, electricity, and fire and confers this immunity to anyone sealed within its inner compartment.  Ram (Ex) The ram attack of the battlehulk is with the ironplated and spike-studded front face. The damage this  attack deals is considered both piercing and bludgeoning. Because of the different metal compositions used in the spikes and enchantments placed on this front facing, this attack is both cold iron and adamantine and is considered magic and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This attack is particularly useful against evil outsiders.  Sweep (Ex) As a full round action a battlehulk can make a bull rush attack with each of its slamming arms on targets within range without provoking attacks of opportunity. Each stone arm is considered a Large creature for this purpose and has a combat maneuver bonus of +45. The flail on the back is also capable of making this bull rush attack on any targets atop the platform (roll separately for each target). Anyone moved off the platform results in a 15-foot fall to the ground below for 1d6 points of damage.																												
Black Rider	13.00	25600	Medium	5	29, touch 15, flat-footed 24	171	12	16	15		24		30 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.

Any creatures in contact with the vapors must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be slowed as per the slow spell. Once affected, the creature remains slowed as long as it is in the aura and for 1 round afterward. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Rider's Robes (Su) The Black Rider wears robes that provide the same protection as full plate armor.  Rider's Weapon (Su) Whenever the Black Rider successfully confirms a critical hit with his +2 icy burst spear, the target is stunned for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Carnivorous Blob	13.00	25600	Colossal	0	2, touch 2, flat-footed 2	184	12	5	0	reactive strike, split (sonic or slashing, 32 hp)		vulnerable to cold	20 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.	slam +17 (8d6+19 plus 1d4 Con drain and grab)		30 ft.	30 ft.	absorb flesh, constrict (8d6+19 plus 1d4 Con drain)	Str 36, Dex 11, Con 24, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	12	+33 (+37 grapple)	43 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Absorb Flesh (Ex) A carnivorous blob cannot eat plant matter or inorganic matter, but it devours living flesh with a voracious speed by dealing Constitution drain on creatures it slams or constricts. Whenever the blob deals Constitution drain in this manner, it heals 10 hit points for each point of Constitution it drains. Excess hit points above its normal maximum are gained as temporary hit points. As soon as a carnivorous blob has at least 50 temporary hit points, it loses those temporary hit points and splits as an immediate action.  Reactive Strike (Ex) Whenever a carnivorous blob takes damage, it reflexively lashes out with a slam attack. This ability effectively grants the carnivorous blob an attack of opportunity against any adjacent foe that deals it damage. These attacks of opportunity do not count against the normal limit the creature can make in a round. Attacks that deal sonic or slashing damage do not trigger a reactive strike-rather, they cause the creature to split. Whenever a carnivorous blob takes cold damage, the creature cannot use its reactive strike ability until after it takes its next action in combat.  Vulnerable to Cold (Ex) A carnivorous blob takes half again as much damage (+50%) from cold attacks.																												
Charybdis	13.00	25600	Gargantuan	3	28, touch 5, flat-footed 28	184	12	6	14				20 ft., swim 50 ft.	bite +20 (2d8+12/19-20 plus grab), 2 claws +20 (2d6+12)		20 ft.	20 ft.	fast swallow, rending claws, swallow whole (6d6 bludgeoning damage plus 6d6 acid damage, AC 21, hp 18), vortex	Str 34, Dex 9, Con 25, Int 4, Wis 19, Cha 6	12	+28 (+32 grapple)	37 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Rending Claws (Ex) A charybdis's claws are particularly devastating when used against objects, and ignore the first 10 points of an object's hardness rating.  Vortex (Su) A charybdis can generate a whirlpool as a standard action at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (see the Universal Monster Rules in Appendix 3), but the whirlpool can only form underwater and cannot leave the water. It's a DC 25 Reflex save to avoid being caught by the charybdis's vortex. The vortex itself is 20 feet across and 120 feet deep, and deals 2d6+12 points of damage per round. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Corpse Lotus	13.00	25600	Huge	2	25, touch 10, flat-footed 23	178	16	7	6	all-around vision			0 ft.	4 vines +20 (1d8+10 plus grab)		15 ft.	25 ft.	swallow whole (4d6 acid damage, AC 17, 17 hp)	Str 30, Dex 15, Con 23, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 14	12	+24 (+26 bull rush)	36 (38 vs. bull rush, can't be tripped)	AP 78	Camouflage (Ex) A corpse lotus can blend in exceptionally well with vegetated areas when not taking any actions. A creature must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to recognize a corpse lotus for what it is before the corpse lotus attacks the first time.  Digest Corpse (Su) A corpse lotus can consume a corpse to quickly heal damage it has taken. As a standard action, a corpse lotus can swallow any corpse (but not a skeleton) within reach to grant itself fast healing 5 for 1 minute. Any creature killed by a corpse lotus's swallow whole ability automatically triggers this ability. A corpse lotus must wait until 1 minute after its fast healing has ended before it can use this ability again.  Preserving Mists (Su) Corpse lotuses emanate a fine mist that spreads across the ground to a range of 30 feet. Any corpse within this area is affected as if by gentle repose.  Vines (Ex) A corpse lotus's vines are primary natural attacks with the grab ability. A corpse lotus doesn't gain the grappled condition when grappling enemies with its vines																												
Corpse Orgy	13.00	25600	Large	4	24, touch 9, flat-footed 24	199	14	8	14				30 ft.	4 slams +20 (2d6+6 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	absorb body, pain shriek	Str 22, Dex 10, Con 23, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 16	14	+21 (+23 bull rush, +25 grapple)	31 (33 vs. bull rush) (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Absorb Body (Su) A corpse orgy can absorb the physical body of any creature it has reduced to 0 or less hit points by moving over it and remaining in contact with it for at least one full round. An unconscious or dying opponent can make a DC 25 Fortitude save to prevent the absorption.  A dead opponent gets no saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. When it absorbs a body, the corpse orgy gains 12 temporary hit points.  A creature whose body is absorbed can only be raised or resurrected if the corpse orgy that absorbed its body is slain and the corpse in question is recovered.  All-Around Vision (Ex) The corpse orgy sees in all directions at once. It can not be flanked.  Pain Shriek (Su) Twice per day, as a standard action, a corpse orgy can unleash a piercing shriek from the various heads captured in its form.  This shriek deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures within a 40-foot radius around the corpse orgy. Affected creatures can make a DC 22 Fortitude save for half damage.  Creatures that cannot hear do not take this damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

If a swallowed creature successfully cuts its way out of a dwiergeth, it must attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save as it crawls out of the hole. If the victim is successful, it escapes the creature, but on a failure, the victim merely crawls from one extradimensional intestine to another and must endure another round of being swallowed whole. A dwiergeth can continue to use swallow whole even after a creature cuts its way out. A creature casting any teleport-based spell or spell-like ability while within 5 feet of a dwiergeth must make a successful DC 21 Will save or the teleportation effect instead sends the target into the dwiergeth's forever gullet. When a dwiergeth is under the effects of dimensional anchor or in an area that prohibits extradimensional travel, it loses the abilities of its forever gullet, but its swallow whole ability functions normally. The save DC is Charisma-based, and it has a +2 racial bonus.																												
Earth Elemental Construct	13.00	25600	Huge	-1	25, touch 7, flat-footed 25	205	10	9	10	earth mastery			30 ft.	2 slams +42 (2d10+14)		15 ft.	15 ft.	pound 2d10+14 (DC 39), trample (2d10+21, DC 39)	Str 38, Dex 8, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	30	46	55	Tome of Horrors Complete	Earth Mastery (Ex) An earth elemental construct gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental construct takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) Immunity to Magic (Ex) An earth elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell slows an earth elemental construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A transmute mud to rock spell heals all of its lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not change its structure, but deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the construct who can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 16 + caster's relevant ability score modifier) for half damage. Pound (Ex) An earth elemental construct can slam an opponent that is at least two size categories smaller than itself into the ground, wall, or other nearby solid surfaces, dealing bludgeoning damage, when it makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage). In addition, the pounded creature is stunned for 1 round; a DC 39 Fortitude save negates this additional effect. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Fire Elemental Construct	13.00	25600	Huge	9	28, touch 17, flat-footed 19	205	10	19	10			vulnerability to cold	60 ft.	2 slams +36 (2d6+8 plus burn)		15 ft.	15 ft.	burn (1d8, DC 25)	Str 27, Dex 29, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	30	40	59	Tome of Horrors Complete	Fiery Aura (Ex) Anyone within 10 feet of a fire elemental construct must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of fire damage each round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A fire elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A cold effect slows a fire elemental construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds with no saving throw. This is in addition to any damage it takes because of its vulnerability to cold. A quench spell negates the fire elemental construct's damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 round. Any water-based spell of 5th level or higher deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the fire elemental construct. The construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level + caster's relevant ability score modifier) to half the damage. Any fire-based spell or effect heals 1 point of damage on the fire elemental construct for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

The organs and fluids are then absorbed by the tree's roots.  Corpses of a size other than Medium or Large are simply left to rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled with a greenish pollen fired from one of the tree's branches. The abdominal wound heals over the next 1d4 days, at which time the slain creature rises as a gallows tree zombie connected by a tether-vine to the gallows tree that created it. Gallows tree zombies possess none of their former abilities.  Gallows Tree Zombies (Ex) Each gallows tree has several gallows tree zombies connected to it.  A Huge gallows tree may have no more than 7 gallows tree zombies connected to it at one time.  A Gargantuan gallows tree can have a maximum of 11 zombies connected to it at any given time.  See the gallows tree zombie entry in this book for details on that monster.  Tremorsense (Ex) Gallows trees can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the same vegetation the tree is touching.

Corpse Consumption (Su) A gashadokuro that kills creature by using its swallow whole special ability automatically consumes its victim's body and regains a number of hit points equal to the victim's Constitution score. Consumed creatures cannot be resurrected by any effect short of a miracle or wish spell until the gashadokuro is destroyed.  Starvation Aura (Su) A gashadokuro emits a powerful aura that causes all creatures within range to feel the intense pains of starvation. Each creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be fatigued and succumb to the supernatural starvation of the gashadokuro, taking 2d6 points of nonlethal damage at the end of its turn each round it remains in the aura. Even after leaving the area or slaying the gashadokuro, an affected creature continues to starve and cannot heal from the nonlethal damage dealt by this ability until it consumes food (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444).

(perfect)	#ERROR!	2 light rays +14 ranged touch (2d12)	5 ft.	5 ft.	gaze	Str 25, Dex 12, Con 20, Int 16, Wis 19, Cha 17	13	20	31	PFRPG Bestiary	Gaze (Su) In humanoid form, a ghaele's gaze attack slays evil creatures of 5 HD or less (range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates, shaken for 2d10 rounds on a successful save). Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be shaken for 2d10 rounds. A creature that saves against a ghaele's gaze is immune to that particular ghaele's gaze for 24 hours. This is a mindaffecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Light Form (Su) A ghaele can shift between its solid body and one made of light as a standard action. In solid form, it cannot fly or use light rays. In light form, it can fly and gains the incorporeal quality-it can make light ray attacks or use spell-like abilities in this form, but can't make physical attacks or cast spells. This ability otherwise functions similarly to a bralani's wind form ability. Light Ray (Ex) A ghaele's light rays have a range of 300 feet. This attack bypasses all damage reduction. Spells Ghaeles cast divine spells as 13th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.

Bloodspray (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a ghorazagh can unleash a 20-foot cone of blood and eldritch enzymes. Any living creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be affected as by the spell slow. A slowed creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray a second time must make an additional save or be paralyzed. These effects last for 2d6 rounds. A ghorazagh can also consciously alter its enzymes, producing a spray that removes all effects of this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Chemical Communication (Ex) Ghorazaghs can communicate with other ghorazaghs within 60 feet via pheromone transmission. In a ghorazagh hive, this range extends to cover the entire hive. This is a silent and instantaneous mode of communication that only ghorazaghs can understand.																												
Gibbering Abomination	13.00	25600	Large	7	22, touch 12, flat-footed 19	162	13	9	8	amorphous			10 ft., climb 10 ft.	6 bites +12 (1d8+4 plus grab /19-20)		10 ft.	5 ft.	arcane frenzy, blood drain, disruptive cacophony	Str 18, Dex 16, Con 25, Int 10, Wis 6, Cha 19	9	+14 (+18 grapple)	27 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	All-Around Vision (Ex) A gibbering abomination sees in all directions at once. It cannot be flanked List special ability info here.  Amorphous (Ex) A gibbering abomination's body is malleable and shapeless. It is immune to precision damage (like sneak attacks) and critical hits, and can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing.  Arcane Frenzy (Ex) A gibbering abomination is capable of using its spell-like abilities more frequently than other creatures. It may use a single spell-like ability each round as a swift action, two spell-like abilities as a standard action, or four spell-like abilities as a full-round action; it may not choose to do more than one of these in the same round, and cannot use this ability in the same round it uses Disruptive Cacophony. When engaging in an arcane frenzy, the gibbering abomination may use the same spell-like ability multiple times, but may not use the same spell-like ability against the same target twice in one round. If more than one spell-like ability is used, the specific spell-like abilities and their targets must be determined before any effects are determined, including saves and attack rolls.  Blood Drain (Ex) On a successful grapple check after grabbing, several of the creature's mouths attach to its target. Each round it maintains its grapple, the gibbering abomination automatically deals 3d6+12 points of bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's blood.  Deathless (Su) When a gibbering abomination is slain, it is not truly dead, and 1 hour later it returns to life at 0 hit points, allowing fast healing thereafter to resume healing it. A gibbering abomination can be permanently destroyed only with death magic or complete incineration of its remains (such as dumping it into a pool of magma).  Disruptive Cacophony (Su) As a free action the gibbering abomination may produce a horrible quasi-arcane chanting that is highly disruptive to nearby magic effects. Any creature that can clearly hear this chanting (maximum range 100 ft.) must make a concentration check (DC 20 plus level of spell) to successfully cast a spell or use a spell-like ability. The check DC is Charisma-based. A gibbering abomination that uses this ability may not use any of its spell-like abilities on its current turn, or until the start of its next turn.  Pain Immunity (Ex) Because the gibbering abomination is already in incredible pain, it is immune to any effect or condition caused as a result of extreme pain or agony. This ability does not protect it against any physical damage it might suffer as well, however.

This aura deals 2d6 points of profane damage to all creatures in any space adjacent to the grimm. Evil creatures do not take this damage.  Blur (Su) As a move action, a grimm can blur its form (as the spell of the same name). This grants it concealment (20% miss chance).  Devour (Su) If a grimm pins a grappled creature, it deals 1d6 points of Strength drain each round the pin is maintained. Each time the grimm drains Strength, it gains a +1 bonus to its Strength score. These bonus points are temporary and the grimm loses them at the rate of 1 per hour.  Ethereal Jaunt (Su) A grimm can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action and shift back again as a free action. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane for 3 rounds before returning to the Material Plane. The ability otherwise resembles the spell of the same name (caster level 20th).  Fey Spell Resistance (Ex) Against fey magic (spells or spell-like abilities used by any fey creature including elves) a grimm's spell resistance is 28.

Str 23, Dex 21, Con 22, Int 25, Wis 22, Cha 20	14	21	36	PFRPG Bestiary	Slow (Su) A hit from an ice devil's tail or spear induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds. This effect comes from the devil in the case of its weapon; it is not a quality possessed by the spear itself.  The save DC is Constitution-based.

Any creatures struck must make a DC 23 Reflex save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and be blinded for 1d6 rounds. A successful save halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1 point) and negates the blindness.  Hold Breath (Ex) An inkanyamba can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning or suffocating.  Hypnotic Sway (Su) As a full-round action, an inkanyamba can unfurl its hood and sway back and forth. Any nonmindless creature within 30 feet that views an inkanyamba's hypnotic sway must make a DC 23 Will save or be fascinated for 1d4 rounds. Any attack by the inkanyamba breaks the fascination effect. Any creature that successfully saves or has the fascination effect broken cannot be affected by the same inkanyamba's hypnotic sway for 24 hours.  Poison (Ex) An inkanyamba's body contains a host of different venoms. Once per round as a swift action, it can change which ability score its poison affects.  Vacillating Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds, effect 1d4 ability damage, cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Venomsense (Ex) An inkanyamba that makes physical contact with a living creature through either its bite, tail slap, or constriction ability gains an automatic knowledge of the target's ability scores, allowing the inkanyamba to better use its protean venom on its victims.																												
Irlgaunt	13.00	25600	Large	13	29, touch 18, flat-footed 20	133	9	15	13				40 ft., climb 40 ft.	2 slams +17 (1d8+8 plus 1d6 acid), bite +17 (1d8+8)	1 gastrolith +18 (2d6+8 plus 2d6 acid)	10 ft.	5 ft.	gastrolith	Str 27, Dex 29, Con 20, Int 16, Wis 18, Cha 19	10	19	38 (42 vs. trip)	AP 35	Gastrolith (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, an irlgaunt can violently regurgitate a clot of brittle stone and digestive acids. This gastrolith is treated as a thrown splash weapon with a range increment of 30 feet. In addition to damaging any creature struck (as noted above), any creature within 10 feet of the point where the gastrolith strikes (whether a creature or a grid intersection) takes 1d6 points of acid damage. A gastrolith that misses its target hits a nearby point, just like a normal miss with a splash weapon, as detailed on page 202 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. An irlgaunt has a separate orifice for ejecting gastroliths. Thus, it can make a ranged attack in addition to all its normal melee attacks. Stone Step (Ex) An irlgaunt can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while in rocky or subterranean terrain. Magically altered terrain affects an irlgaunt as normal.																												
Iron Golem	13.00	25600	Large	-1	28, touch 8, flat-footed 28	129	6	5	6				20 ft.	2 slams +28 (2d10+16/19-20)		10 ft.	10 ft.	breath weapon, powerful blows	Str 32, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	18	30	39	PFRPG Bestiary	Breath Weapon (Su) As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, an iron golem can exhale a 10-foot cube of poisonous gas. This gas cloud persists for 1 round; any creature within the area when the golem creates it (as well as any creature that passes through the cloud during the remainder of that round) is exposed to the cloud's poisonous effects. This poison is magically created each time the golem uses this power.  Breath weapon-inhaled; save Fort 19; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) An iron golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.  • A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  • A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. An iron golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.  • An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.  Powerful Blows (Ex) An iron golem inflicts one and a half times its Strength modifier and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks.

Similarly, any male humanoid slain by a banshee's death wail or energy drain rises to become a dread wraith in 1d4 rounds.  Lifesense (Ex) Lesser banshee's can detect living creatures within 60 feet, as if they possessed the blindsight ability. In addition, the lesser banshee senses the strength and life-force of the creature, as the spell deathwatch.  Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) A banshee is powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flees from it, typically by hiding within a solid object. A banshee caught in sunlight cannot attack or use its wail and can take only a single standard or move action in a round.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals can sense the aura of a lesser banshee at a distance of 30 feet. The animal will not willingly near a lesser banshee, and panics if forced to do so.  Wail (Su) A lesser banshee may let loose a wail so horrible that those within 30 feet must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or die. The lesser banshee may only use her death wail at night, and no more than twice per day. After using this ability a lesser banshee must wait for 1d6 rounds before using it again. The save is Charisma-based, and includes the bonus from the Ability Focus feat.

Each time a creature suffers damage from a living monolith's acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 27 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a living monolith takes 2d6 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 27 Reflex save. If a living monolith remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 27 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Spawn Offspring (Ex) Every 1d4 rounds, a living monolith spawns 1d6 crawling offspring from its form, but 1d6 of these are instantly destroyed or reabsorbed by the living monolith. (See the Crawling Offspring entry below.)  Tentacles (Ex) A living monolith can transfer a grabbed opponent from a tentacle to one of its mouths as a move action.

The creature automatically hits with its touch attack against any creature that fails to notice it and enters its square.  Glyph Touch (Su) A living rune deals 3d8 points of electricity damage with a successful touch attack, and it uses its Dexterity modifier (instead of its Strength modifier) to resolve all touch attacks.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A living rune is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain other spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  • An erase spell deals 6d6 points of damage to a living rune.  • A living rune caught in the radius of any symbol spell is immune to its effects and heals 1d8 points of damage per spell level. Hit points beyond its total maximum are gained as temporary hit points that fade in 1 hour.  • A living rune is affected normally by magic missile, maze, and spells that deal sonic damage.  Symbols of Power (Su) As a standard action, a living rune can shift its form into a number of powerful symbols whose effects can damage or incapacitate opponents. Each round the living rune can choose a new effect, but a particular symbol form can only be used once every 4 rounds. This attack is resolved with a touch attack and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Fear: The target becomes panicked for 2d6 rounds (Will DC 24).  Pain: The target suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 hour (Fort DC 24).  Persuasion: The target is charmed by the living rune (as charm monster) for 2d6 hours (Will DC 24).  Slow: The target is slowed (as the slow spell) for 12 rounds (Will DC 24).

A living rune can also understand any written or spoken language.  Two-Dimensional (Ex) A living rune only exists in two dimensions, and has some qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A living rune has no Strength score. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as jumping or flying), and can only navigate along solid surfaces such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can only attack creatures by entering their squares and touching them directly. A living rune can crawl onto solid surfaces that can then themselves be moved (such as onto a tome via its telekinesis spell-like ability). It cannot fall or take falling damage, cannot make trip or grapple attacks, and cannot be tripped or grappled. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the opponent's equipment, has no weight, and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight. A living rune takes no damage from nonmagical attacks and only takes half damage from magical weapons.

An impaled opponent is considered pinned and thereafter takes 3d6 points of damage each round until it breaks free. An impaled opponent must succeed on a grapple check against the mire brute's CMD to break free. A mire brute is not considered grappled while it has an opponent impaled. A Huge mire brute can impale 1 Large, 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 32 Tiny or smaller opponents at one time.

In human form, the Mouse Lord cannot use her natural weapons or disease special attack but can wield weapons and wear armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Mouse Lord retains her movement modes (and speeds) in human form.  Disease (Ex): Black fever-bite, save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day; damage 1d4 Dex, 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. The Mouse Lord can suppress her ability to cause disease (as a free action) if she so wishes.  Immortality (Su) The Mouse Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Mouse Lord's soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within one week, it inhabits another mouse or rat on the Material Plane and the Mouse Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap her soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Mouse Lord, one must destroy every mouse and rat in existence (so her soul has no creature to inhabit).  Keen Senses (Ex): The Mouse Lord sees four times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light.  Rodent Passivism (Ex): Rodents (including dire versions) do not willingly attack the Mouse Lord, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the Mouse Lord attacks a rodent, its protection against that creature ends.																												
Nysrock Demon	13.00	25600	Large	2	25, touch 11, flat-footed 23	202	19	11	9		24		40 ft.	bite +22 (2d6+7 plus grab), sting +22 (2d4+7 plus  poison)	spit +16 (poison)	10 ft.	5 ft.	constrict (2d6+10)	Str 24, Dex 14, Con 26, Int 16, Wis 19, Cha 18	15	+23 (+27 grapple)	35 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Poison (Ex) Sting or spit-injury or contact; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Obambo	13.00	25600	Medium	8	21, touch 21, flat-footed 17	175	11	10	15	channel resistance +4, rejuvenation, incorporeal			30 ft., fly 30 ft. (perfect)	incorporeal touch +16 (1d6 Int drain plus daze)		5 ft.	5 ft.	jungle animus, thought eater	Str -, Dex 23, Con -, Int 19, Wis 18, Cha 25	10	16	33 (can't be tripped)	AP 40	Jungle Animus (Su) As a full-round action, an obambo can invest its spirit into the land itself and cause the ground to rise up as a Huge mass of soil, mud, vines, roots, and vermin. In this form, it has the statistics of an advanced giant shambling mound, except it keeps its own hit points.  Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy an obambo through simple combat, as the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Only after its remains or place of death is found and appropriate funeral rites are performed does it rest in peace and not return.  Speak with Vermin (Su) An obambo can communicate with vermin, similar to using speak with animals. Vermin can only communicate with instinct-level information.  Thought Eater (Su) An obambo's touch drains 1d6 points of Intelligence and dazes the target for 1 round; a successful DC 24 Fortitude save negates the daze effect and halves the ability drain. The obambo gains 5 temporary hit points and a +1 bonus on all Intelligence-based skill checks for 24 hours with each successful Intelligence drain; these benefits stack. A creature reduced to 0 Intelligence by this attack is polymorphed into a Diminutive vermin (Fortitude DC 24 negates; otherwise treat as baleful polymorph).  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, both wild and domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of an obambo at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so unless their master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so while within 30 feet of the obambo.																												
Old Gray Dragon	13.00	25600	Huge	4	33, touch 8, flat-footed 33	212	16	12	14		24		60 ft., fly 200 ft. (average), swim 40 ft.	2 claws +24 (2d6+9), bite +25 (2d8+13/19-20), 2 wings +22 (1d8+4), tail slap +22 (2d6+13)		15 ft.	10 ft. (15 ft. with bite)	breath weapon (100-ft. line, 16d6 fire; DC 24 Ref half)	Str 29, Dex 10, Con 23, Int 17, Wis 19, Cha 17	17	28	38 (42 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Breath Weapon (Su) A gray dragon's breath weapon is a superheated line of steam.  Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)  A gray dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.  • Young-fog cloud;  • Juvenile-create water;  • Old-control winds;  • Ancient-control water;  Water Breathing (Ex) A gray dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.

It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.  Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.																												
Oni, Earth Yai	13.00	25600	Large	6	29, touch 15, flat-footed 23	184	16	11	14		24		50 ft., fly 50 ft.

These spikes are treated as armor spikes that deal 1d10 points of damage.  Stony Missile (Su) As a swift action, an earth yai can fire an incredibly dense stone from its third eye. This attack has a range of 200 feet, with no range increment, and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Upon striking the target, the stone immediately makes an Awesome Blow attempt against the target using the earth yai's CMB.																												
Oolioddroo	13.00	25600	Medium	7	28, touch 22, flat-footed 20	175	11	16	16	shadow mantle	24		30 ft., fly 40 ft. (perfect)	2 claws +21 (1d4+2), tongue +21 (1d6+2 plus thought siphon)		5 ft.	5 ft.	oviposition, sneak attack +3d6	Str 14, Dex 25, Con 24, Int 21, Wis 24, Cha 23	14	16	38	The Worldwound	Oviposition (Su) As a full-round action once per day, an oolioddroo can use its tongue to implant its eggs into the brain of a helpless, sleeping, unconscious, or willing creature, dealing 1 point of Intelligence damage. Typically, the oolioddroo uses modify memory immediately after an oviposition, making its victim forget the violation. The egg gestates in the victim's brain for 24 hours, after which a small caterpillar-like larva emerges and nestles painlessly into the victim's brain. At this point, the oolioddroo can track the victim's location as if the victim were under the effect of a status spell, can communicate telepathically with the victim across any distance, and can use its detect thoughts, modify memory, and suggestion spell-like abilities through the link to target the victim. The larva (and link to its oolioddroo) becomes inert whenever the victim and the oolioddroo are on separate planes. Victims carrying this larva detect as chaotic and evil. Anyone who reads the victim's thoughts, such as via detect thoughts or telepathy, can attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by the oolioddroo's Bluff check to notice the presence of a second, alien set of thoughts in the target's mind. Dispel chaos and dispel evil immediately ends the oviposition- the implanted larva melts into harmless fluid and is absorbed by the victim's body. This is not a disease effect, though, so heal or remove disease offer no aid in ending the effect. As an immediate action, an oolioddroo can use its feeblemind spell-like ability on the carrier-it uses this "scorched earth" tactic if it fears that the host is about to be rescued or cut off from its influence, such as occurs when the effects are ended via dispel chaos or dispel evil. Using feeblemind in this way automatically destroys the larva, regardless of whether or not the victim saves against the feeblemind effect, so an oolioddroo typically waits until the last moment to use this ability.  See Thoughts (Su) An oolioddroo can see a creature's thoughts, interpreting them as a shifting mass of images, colors, and shapes that infuse a creature's aura. An oolioddroo gains the effects of see invisibility against creatures with an Intelligence score as a result of this unusual sense. This ability also grants the oolioddroo a +8 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks. When it uses detect thoughts, it does not have to study an area or subject to gain all 3 rounds of information-it gains all of this information on the 1st round of using the ability. In addition, it gains a +4 racial bonus on the save DC of its detect thoughts spell-like ability. A blind oolioddroo loses the ability to see thoughts.  Shadow Mantle (Su) The supernatural shadows that wreathe an oolioddroo grant the creature a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks and a +4 deflection bonus to its Armor Class.  Thought Siphon (Su) Whenever an oolioddroo damages a creature with its tongue attack, it can drink away one of the creature's thoughts or memories. A creature can resist this attack with a successful DC 23 Will save. On a failed save, the oolioddroo chooses to target the victim with one of the following effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Memory Drain: The victim is immediately affected by the oolioddroo's modify memory spell-like ability. The oolioddroo can adjust up to 5 minutes of memories immediately-it does not need to increase the spell's casting time to match the duration of the modified memory.  Skill Drain: The victim loses all skill ranks in a skill of the oolioddroo's choosing for 24 hours. Lost skill ranks can be recovered immediately with a restoration or greater restoration spell.  Spell Drain: The victim immediately loses one prepared spell or one unused spell slot of the oolioddroo's choice; this lost spell or spell slot can be replenished normally.  Wisdom Drain: The victim takes 2 points of Wisdom drain.  Tongue (Ex) An oolioddroo's tongue attack is a primary attack that does piercing and slashing damage. Whenever an oolioddroo damages a foe with its tongue, it can use its thought siphon attack.																												
Pit Hag	13.00	25600	Medium	9	28, touch 16, flat-footed 22	171	12	16	17		24		40 ft.	pitchfork +23 (2d6+7) or 2 claws +23 (1d8+5)		5 ft.	5 ft.	rend (2 claws, 1d8+5)	Str 20, Dex 20, Con 19, Int 16, Wis 18, Cha 19	18	23	38	Tome of Horrors Complete	Aura of Affliction (Su) Three times per day for up to 1 round per Hit Dice the pit hag possesses, she can emit an aura in a 30-foot radius as a free action. Creatures within or coming within the area must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or contract devil chills.  Devil Chills: Aura-affliction; save Fort DC 23; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spells A pit hag casts arcane spells as an 11th-level sorcerer.  It favors evocation and necromancy spells.																												
Prismatic Orrery	13.00	25600	Gargantuan	2	24, touch 8, flat-footed 22	159	6	8	6	all-around vision, dispel resistance, hardness 10			0 ft. (cannot move)	slam +21 (6d6+10 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 25, Dex 14, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 1	18	+29 (+33 grapple)	41	Tombs Of Golarion	Blinding Pulse (Ex) As a move action, the prismatic orrery can set its lenses to refract the light of the prismatic sphere at its center, granting it a gaze attack that causes blindness in all targets that fail a DC 19 Fortitude saving throw. This gaze attack can be disabled as a move action, and is automatically disabled if the orrery uses its prismatic refraction ability or if the prismatic sphere is temporarily dispelled. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Dispel Resistance (Su) The prismatic sphere at the center of the orrery (CL 20th) can be dispelled with a targeted dispel magic spell, but only temporarily. As the sphere is fueled by the elemental energies within the Prismatic Lantern's demiplane, it reappears after 1d3 rounds. While the prismatic sphere is inactive, the prismatic orrery cannot use its blinding pulse and prismatic refraction abilities.  Prismatic Refraction (Ex) As a standard action, the prismatic orrery can position its many rings and lenses such that the magical energy of the prismatic sphere at its center is aimed in a series of beams at all targets within 60 feet. These beams take the form of a prismatic spray spell (CL 13th); determine the color of each ray randomly with a roll of 1d8 as indicated in the spell. A prismatic refraction ray is a ranged touch attack with a +17 bonus to hit and a save DC of 21. It takes the prismatic orrery 1d4 rounds to recalibrate its lenses to recharge this ability. The save DC is Dexterity-based.																												
Reliquary Guardian	13.00	25600	Large	1	28, touch 10, flat-footed 27	118	7	6	10				30 ft.	#ERROR!		10 ft.	10 ft.	magic weapon, pronouncement	Str 31, Dex 12, Con -, Int 10, Wis 17, Cha 16	16	27	38	Tome of Horrors Complete	Alignment Subtype (Ex) Because a reliquary is infused with a spark from their creator's deity, the creature gains the appropriate subtype(s) based on its alignment. Thus, a lawful good reliquary guardian has both the Good and Lawful subtypes. In addition, a reliquary guardian's weapons and natural attacks can overcome this type of damage reduction as if its weapons and natural attacks had an alignment (or alignments) that match the reliquary guardian's subtype(s).  Further, its damage reduction is based on its alignment subtype(s). Thus a chaotic evil reliquary guardian has damage reduction 10/lawful and good while a lawful good reliquary guardian has damage reduction 10/chaotic and evil.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A reliquary guardian is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a reliquary guardian, as noted below.  A dispel (chaos/evil/good/law) spell targeted against an appropriately aligned reliquary guardian deals 4d6 points of damage to it.  A blasphemy spell heals an evil-aligned reliquary guardian of all its lost hit points. Likewise, a dictum spell heals a lawaligned reliquary guardian; a holy word spell heals a goodaligned reliquary guardian; and a word of chaos spell heals a chaos-aligned reliquary guardian.  Magic Weapon (Ex) A reliquary guardian carries a +1 greatsword with an alignment special quality that matches its alignment on the good-evil axis or the law-chaos axis.  Thus, a chaotic evil reliquary guardian might carry a +1 anarchic greatsword or a +1 unholy greatsword while a lawful good reliquary guardian would carry either a +1 axiomatic greatsword or a +1 holy greatsword.  Pronouncement (Su) Once per day, a reliquary guardian can make a pronouncement that affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. This pronouncement otherwise functions as a blasphemy, dictum, holy word, or word of chaos spell. Note: a reliquary guardian only has one type of pronouncement. It is set during the construction process based on the creator's alignment and the reliquary guardian's alignment and cannot be changed.  The Will save, where applicable, has a DC of 21. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  Blasphemy: CE, LE, or NE reliquary guardians.  Dictum: LG, LE, or LN reliquary guardians.  Holy Word: CG, LG, or NG reliquary guardians.  Word of Chaos: CE, CG, or CN reliquary guardians.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A reliquary guardian has a total of five spell-like abilities (one each of spell levels 1st thru 5th), each usable once per day. Its spell-like abilities are based on its alignment and are drawn from one of the following cleric domains: Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law. A reliquary guardian whose alignment is CE, CG, LG, or LE must be assigned a single domain (one that matches one of its alignment axes) during construction. This domain can never be changed.  Regardless of the reliquary guardian's alignment, its spell-like abilities function at caster level 16th. The save DCs are Wisdom-based.																												
Seaweed Siren	13.00	25600	Large	2	26, touch 11, flat-footed 24	184	16	12	8				30 ft., swim 30 ft.	bite +25 (4d6+15/19-20)	3 sonic beams +17 (5d6 sonic)	10 ft.	5 ft.	staggering gaze, trample (1d10+15, DC 28)	Str 30, Dex 15, Con 22, Int 11, Wis 16, Cha 19	16	27	39 (47 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Cacophony (Su) A seaweed siren's noises disrupt spellcasting; casting within 100 feet of a seaweed siren requires a concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell being cast). All other concentration checks and Perception checks involving hearing made inside the aura have their DCs increased by 5. A siren can begin or end this ability as a free action. This is a sonic effect.  False Heads (Ex) A seaweed siren's false heads can be severed. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting the head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the siren's Hit Dice (typically 16 hp). To sever a head, an opponent must deal enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or fewer. Severing a head deals an amount of damage to the siren's body equal to the siren's Hit Dice. A siren can't attack with a severed head. A siren with no remaining heads can't use its cacophony ability or its spell-like abilities. Sonic Beams (Su) Each of the siren's false heads can fire a beam at a range of 60 feet, dealing 4d6 points of sonic damage.  Staggering Gaze (Su) Staggered 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 22 negates. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Water Dependency (Ex) A seaweed siren can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution (typically 22 rounds). Beyond this limit, a seaweed siren begins to suffocate.																												
Set Guardian	13.00	25600	Large	1	29, touch 9, flat-footed 27	151	7	8	10			unholy weaknesses	40 ft.	2 slams +30 (2d12+9/18-20)		10 ft.	10 ft.	elemental conduit (ruby), mighty blows, trumpet of doom	Str 28, Dex 13, Con -, Int -, Wis 17, Cha 21	22	32	43	AP 84	Elemental Conduit (Su) Each Set guardian is immune to a specific energy type, and can absorb damage of this type and then discharge it in an intense burst. When a Set guardian would be damaged by the specified energy type, it is instead unharmed. As a free action on the following round, it discharges this energy in a 20-foot radius dealing half again as much damage (150%) as it would have taken from the effect. This discharge occurs even if the Set guardian was destroyed on the previous round. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves this damage. The gemstones in the eye sockets of the Set guardian's headpiece determine the energy type.  Emerald: Set guardians with emerald gemstones are immune to and absorb electricity damage.  Ruby: Set guardians with ruby gemstones are immune to and absorb fire damage.  Sapphire: Set guardians with sapphire gemstones are immune to and absorb cold damage.  Topaz: Set guardians with topaz gemstones are immune to and absorb acid damage.  Another Set guardian that has the same energy type keyed to this ability is unharmed by the damage from this burst, but also doesn't absorb the energy. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Mighty Blows (Ex) A Set guardian's slam attacks score a critical threat on a natural 18-20, and deal double damage on a critical hit. If both slam attacks successfully hit in a single round, the target is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds unless the target makes a successful DC 21 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Trumpet of Doom (Su) Once every 3 rounds as a free action, a Set guardian can emit a sonic blast from its headpiece that deals 2d8+2 points of damage and stuns all creatures within 20 feet of the construct for a single round. A successful DC 21 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stunned condition. Other Set guardians are immune to this effect. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  Unholy Weaknesses (Ex) Due to the necromantic techniques used in its creation, certain spells and effects affect a Set guardian differently than they otherwise would. A Set guardian is treated as undead for the purposes of spells or effects that deal more damage to undead, like searing light, sunbeam, or sunburst. A Set guardian in the area of effect of positive energy channeled to damage undead is slowed 1 round for every 3d6 points of damage channeled (minimum 1 round). A raise dead spell cast on a Set guardian paralyzes it for 1d4 rounds.

Shadow Cloak (Ex) Because of the shadow giant's connection with the Plane of Shadow, as a move action in any illumination other than direct sunlight, a shadow giant can cloak itself in moving shadows that act as the spell blur for 1d6+6 rounds. It can use this ability three times per day.																												
Shadow Roper	13.00	25600	Large	5	27, touch 10, flat-footed 26	162	13	5	13	shadow blend	27	vulnerable to fire	10 ft.	bite +20 (4d8+18/19-20)	6 strands +10 touch (1d6 Str)	10 ft.	10 ft.	pull (strands, 5 ft.), strands	Str 34, Dex 13, Con 29, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 12	9	22	33 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Strands (Ex) A shadow roper can extend up to six thin, sticky strands from its body at a time, launching them to a maximum range of 50 feet. A shadow roper's attacks with its strands resolve as ranged touch attacks. These strands are quite strong, but can be severed by any amount of slashing damage; each strand has an AC of 20. A creature struck by a strand is numbed and weakened by the strange material, and must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Shipmind	13.00	25600	Huge	13	27, touch 17, flat-footed 18	161	11	13	12	amorphous, thought disruption	24	limited mobility, vulnerable to cold	0 ft. or 10 ft. (limited mobility)	3 slams +20 (1d8+12 plus 1d4 Int damage and grab)	plasma bolt +17 touch (10d6 plasma/19-20)	15 ft.	15 ft.	immerse	Str 34, Dex 28, Con 24, Int 21, Wis 23, Cha 21	10	24	43 (can't be tripped)	AP 88	Container (Ex) A shipmind dwells within an immobile container of partially organic material grown by its Dominion masters. This container functions somewhat like a suit of armor for the shipmind. A shipmind container has hardness 10 and 240 hit points, and can be damaged by sunder attempts. A shipmind container that gains the broken quality grants only a +5 armor bonus to the  shipmind within, and does not allow the shipmind to heal negative levels gained during a prolonged period outside of the container (see Limited Mobility). The partially crystalline nature of a shipmind container makes it vulnerable to shatter spells, and sonic damage bypasses the container's hardness and inflicts full damage.  Immerse (Ex) When a shipmind in its container successfully grabs a Large or smaller target with one of its slam attacks, it can attempt to drag that target into its body as a swift action. To immerse a creature, the shipmind must attempt a combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, the prey is pulled into the container with the shipmind and immediately takes 6d6 points of plasma damage (half of which is electricity and half of which is fire) and 1d4 points of Intelligence damage-a successful DC 24 Fortitude save halves the plasma damage and negates the Intelligence damage. A creature that remains immersed takes this damage again every following round at the start of the shipmind's turn. In addition, an immersed creature is in danger of suffocating. A creature can attempt to escape immersion by making a successful combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, as if it were attempting to escape a pin. If the shipmind's container has the broken condition, attempts to escape in this manner gain a +8 bonus.  Limited Mobility (Ex) Unlike most oozes, a shipmind cannot exist outside of the partially organic container it was originally created in-this container serves the shipmind as its "skin." While inside its container, a shipmind has a speed of 0 feet. When it leaves its container, it gains a speed of 10 feet, but loses its armor bonus to AC. A shipmind can exist outside of its container for 1 hour without consequences, but at the start of each subsequent hour it gains 1 negative level as its body starts to dissolve. These negative levels cannot be restored by any means save by returning to an appropriate shipmind container, at which point they are removed at a rate of 1 level per hour.  Plasma Bolt (Su) As a standard action, a shipmind can fire a bolt of plasma at a target within 300 feet (no range increment). On a hit, a blast of plasma deals 10d6 damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.  Ship Interface (Ex) As long as a shipmind is interfaced with a Dominion vessel, it can observe events within the ship or within 90 feet of its exterior hull as if via clairaudience/ clairvoyance for as long as the shipmind concentrates. While concentrating on an area, the shipmind can activate traps or other ship systems in the area as a swift action; it can even converse with creatures in the area by vibrating the metal and strange membranes in the walls.  Thought Disruption (Su) The substance that makes up a shipmind ooze is charged with alien psychic energy that is toxic to the minds of most life forms. A creature who  willfully touches an ooze (via a touch attack, natural weapon attack, or unarmed strike) or is struck by its slam attack must make a DC 22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Fear Gaze (Su) Cower in fear for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 21 negates. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Soul Crush (Su) A thanadaemon can crush a soul gem (see cacodaemon) as a standard action to gain fast healing 15 for 15 rounds (this is a standard action).

Once activated, the cloud persists for 5 rounds unless dispersed by moderate or stronger wind. All creatures in the cloud must succeed on a DC 24 Will saving throw each round or become captivated. Once a creature becomes captivated, it takes no actions save to approach the viper vine via the most direct route possible. If this path leads it into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. A victim that is attacked by the viper vine gets a new saving throw as a free action during each of the vine's attacks to overcome the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Cold Lethargy (Ex) Exposure to any cold effect slows a viper vine (as a slow spell) for 1d4 rounds.

The construct can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equal's the elemental construct's HD). Engulf (Ex) A water elemental construct can simply engulf Large or smaller creatures in its path as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The water elemental construct merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the construct, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 36 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed- on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the construct moves forward. Engulfed creatures are in danger of suffocating, and are trapped within its body until they are no longer pinned. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A water elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A control water spell or cold effect slows a water elemental construct for 2d6 rounds with no saving throw. A horrid wilting spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to a water elemental construct. The elemental construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 18 + caster's relevant ability modifier) for half damage. A create water spell heals 1d4 points of damage on the construct for each 2 gallons of water created. Water Mastery (Ex) A water elemental construct gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental construct is touching the ground, the elemental construct takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)

Constant Blaze (Su) A wickerman constantly burns but is never consumed. Its flames are magical. Immersion in water only suppresses the flames, and only for as long as the wickerman is immersed. While its flames are suppressed, the wickerman loses its burn ability, and its wicker cage ability doesn't deal fire damage or cause creatures to catch on fire.  Fire Healing (Ex) A magical attack that deals fire damage heals the wickerman 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.  Wicker Cage (Su) If a wickerman successfully grapples a creature, as a move action it can shove the grabbed creature into the cage built into its chest. This works like swallow whole (4d6 fire damage plus the target automatically catches on fire [Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444], AC 17, 15 hp). The DC to put out this fire is 17. If a creature cuts its way free, the wickerman can't use this ability again until it is fully healed. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Entangle (Su) As a standard action, up to a number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1), a widow creeper can fire a mass of sticky, clinging vines and weeds to a range of 60 feet at a single target. This requires the widow creeper to succeed on a ranged touch attack with a +11 bonus to hit. A creature hit by the vines is entangled. An entangled creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a full-round action to make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based. Fluid Drain (Ex) A widow creeper can suck brain fluids from a living creature by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains brain fluid, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1 point of Intelligence damage each round that it maintains the hold. Improved Woodland Stride (Su) A widow creeper can move through any sort of undergrowth (natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering other impairment.

Destructive Crush (Su) When an old or older forest dragon makes a crush attack, the impact kicks up debris in a 20-foot-radius burst for 1d6 rounds. The debris obscures the vision of creatures within the debris field and grants concealment to those creatures. The forest dragon can see normally within and through the debris field.  Elemental Breath (Su) Once per day, when an ancient or older forest dragon uses its breath weapon, it can summon a greater earth elemental within the cone. The caster level for these effects is the same as the dragon's caster level.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older forest dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against the listener's Sense Motive check.

Incinerate (Su) A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures in its fiery breath. A creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by its breath weapon must make a Fortitude save (using the breath weapon's DC). Failure indicates that the creature is reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only be restored to life through true resurrection or similar magic. Manipulate Flames (Su) An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires.

(perfect)	2 claws +14 (1d6+8), tail slap +9 (1d8+4 plus bleed), 2 wings +9 (1d8+4 plus bleed)		10 ft.	5 ft.	bleed (2d6), cold iron killer, shadow doubles, sneak attack +3d6	Str 26, Dex 28, Con 22, Int 17, Wis 19, Cha 25	7	16	36	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Cold Iron Killer (Su) All of an ankou's natural weapons are treated as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  Shadow Doubles (Su) Once per day as a free action, an ankou can conjure up to four shadowy duplicates, which appear anywhere within 60 feet of the ankou and last a number of rounds equal to the ankou's Charisma modifier (typically 7 rounds). These shadow doubles are identical to the original in all respects except that when conjured they have a number of hit points equal to 20% of the true ankou's total hit points (26 hit points if conjured by an ankou with full hit points). The doubles have all of the true ankou's melee attacks and abilities, except they can't create more shadow doubles or use the ankou's spell-like abilities except for deeper darkness. Any creature that interacts with a shadow double can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the duplicate (DC 10 + 1/2 the ankou's Hit Dice + the ankou's Charisma modifier, typically DC 24). Against a creature that recognizes a shadow double for what it is, the double functions as a shadow conjuration (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 340). Shadow doubles take double damage from spells with the light descriptor. If the true ankou is slain, is rendered unconscious, or is ever more than 120 feet from a shadow double, the duplicates instantly vanish.																												
Astral Deva	14.00	38400	Medium	8	29, touch 14, flat-footed 25	172	16	13	11	uncanny dodge	25		50 ft., fly 100 ft. (good)	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 26, Dex 19, Con 21, Int 18, Wis 18, Cha 23	15	23	37	PFRPG Bestiary	Stun (Su) If an astral deva strikes an opponent twice in one round with its warhammer, that creature must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based. Uncanny Dodge (Ex) This ability functions identically to the rogue ability. If a deva gains uncanny dodge from a class level, he instead gains improved uncanny dodge.																												
Augnagar	14.00	38400	Huge	3	29, touch 7, flat-footed 29	203	18	10	9				50 ft., climb 50 ft., fly 50 ft. (average)	bite +23 (2d6+11 plus 1d8 bleed and rotting curse),   3 claws +23 (1d8+11 plus 1d8 bleed)		15 ft.	15 ft. (30 ft. with claws)	bleed, horrific appearance (DC 21)	Str 32, Dex 9, Con 28, Int 5, Wis 20, Cha 19	14	27	36 (44 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to an augnagar's horrific appearance are driven momentarily insane. This results in 2 points of Charisma damage and leaves the victim confused for 1d3 rounds.  Rotting Curse (Su): Bite- injury; Save Fort DC 26; Frequency 1/ day; Effect 1d6 Con drain plus constant stench. A creature that suffers the rotting curse imparted by an augnagar's bite displays hideous, festering wounds that exude a horrific stench. This functions as the stench universal monster rule (see page 302), save that it affects all creatures except those that are immune to poison. The victim of this curse receives no saving throw to avoid becoming sickened by the stench, but other creatures can attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save to negate this condition-those who fail remain sickened as long as they remain within 30 feet of the cursed victim. The horrific stench also imparts a -8 penalty on all Stealth checks made by the cursed victim. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Bodythief	14.00	38400	Gargantuan	-1	26, touch 1, flat-footed 25	230	19	1	11	vexing vines			5 ft.	bite +23 (2d8+12 plus grab), 4 tentacles +21 (1d8+6 plus grab)		20 ft.	20 ft. (40 ft. with tentacles)	breath weapon (80-ft. line, 12d6 acid damage, Reflex DC 27 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), swallow whole (4d6 acid damage plus absorb essence; AC 22, 23 hp), transfer	Str 34, Dex 1, Con 25, Int 21, Wis 16, Cha 14	15	+31 (+35 disarm, +35 grapple, +33 trip)	38 (40 vs. disarm, can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Absorb Essence (Su) Creatures in a bodythief's stomach gain 4 negative levels (Fortitude DC 27 half) each round at the start of the bodythief's turn. A check to remove a negative level gained in this way is also DC 27. If the creature dies from the negative levels, its body disintegrates and the bodythief absorbs its life essence. This is a death effect.  Spawn Pod Creature (Su) Once a bodythief has absorbed the life essence of a Large or smaller creature, it can begin growing a duplicate of that creature as a free action. Growing a Tiny or smaller duplicate takes 1 round, a Small duplicate 3 rounds, a Medium duplicate 5 rounds, and a Large duplicate 10 rounds. Duplicates are identical to the creature whose life essence has been devoured, but they gain the pod creature template. They closely resemble the original creature and retain all its memories. The newly created spawn has none of the original creature's equipment, though the bodythief can vomit forth any surviving swallowed gear as a move action. As the duplicate hatches, the bodythief makes a Disguise check to determine the resemblance to the original. The duplicate must be grown within 24 hours of the original's digestion, or its essence and memories dissipate. Only a single duplicate can made of any given creature.  Transfer (Ex) A bodythief can transfer a creature grappled with a tentacle to its mouth with a move action and a successful grapple combat maneuver check.  Vexing Vines (Ex) Each of the bodythief's tentacle vines plus its bite attack can deliver its own attack of opportunity, giving the bodythief five attacks of opportunity per round. It cannot deliver attacks of opportunity with a portion of its body being used to grapple. The bodythief can give up an attack of opportunity with a tentacle to deflect a missile as though it had the Deflect Arrows feat.																												
Brass Golem	14.00	38400	Huge	0	30, touch 8, flat-footed 30	150	6	6	7				40 ft.	brass falchion +29 (3d6+11/18-20 plus 2d6 fire), slam +29 (2d6+11 plus 2d6 fire)		15 ft.	15 ft.	breath weapon (DC 20), heat (2d6 fire)	Str 32, Dex 11, Con -, Int -, Wis 13, Cha 1	20	33	43	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Brass Falchion (Ex) A brass golem's falchion deals damage as a Huge falchion, but is actually a primary natural attack, not a manufactured weapon, and cannot be disarmed.  Breath Weapon (Su) As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, a brass golem can expel a cloud of smoke and cinders that fills a 20-foot cube. This functions as an incendiary cloud that persists for 1d6 rounds, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage (DC 20 Reflex for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Death Throes (Ex) A brass golem explodes when it is destroyed. All creatures within 30 feet of the golem take 12d8 points of fire damage (DC 20 Reflex for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A brass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature.  • A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a brass golem (as per the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  • A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass golem gets no save against fire effects.

This line of magma remains red-hot for 1 round after the linnorm creates it. Creatures that took damage on the first round take 6d6 fire damage the second round (Reflex DC 24 negates), as does any creature that walks across the line of magma. If the magma was expelled while the linnorm was airborne, it instead rains downward during the second round as a sheet of fire no more than 60 feet high that does 6d6 damage (Reflex DC 24 negates) to any creature that passes through it. On the third round, the line of magma cools to a thin layer of brittle stone that quickly degrades to powder and sand over the course of several hours; magma that's turned to a sheet of fire is consumed entirely during the second round, leaving behind only a stain of smoke in the air that swiftly disperses. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Death Curse (Su) When a creature slays a crag linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse of fire.  Curse of Fire: save Will DC 22; effect creature gains vulnerability to fire. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Freedom of Movement (Ex) A crag linnorm is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as per the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.  Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 2d6 fire damage and 1d4 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  True Seeing (Ex) A crag linnorm has constant true seeing, as per the spell of the same name.																												
Dark Matter Entropic Ooze	14.00	38400	Huge	-3	13, touch 5, flat-footed 13	391	19	6	+9 (+11 vs. charm effects)		24 (against positive  energy)		20 ft.

Such a creature cannot be returned to life until the entropic ooze that contains its soul is slain.  Soulsight (Su) An entropic ooze can automatically detect the location of any living creature within 120 feet. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.																												
Demi-lich	14.00	38400	Tiny	4	24, touch 18, flat-footed 23	133	16	11	19	channel resistance +4, unholy grace		vorpal susceptibility	fly 30 ft. (perfect)			2-1/2 ft.	0 ft.	trap the soul	Str 10, Dex 10, Con -, Int 20, Wis 20, Cha 20	10	8	28 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Immunity to Magic (Ex) A demi-lich is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw. A power word kill spell cast by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the demi-lich if it fails a Fortitude save (DC 19 + caster's relevant ability score modifier). Note: power word kill does not normally allow a save.) A holy smite spell affects the demi-lich normally. A dispel evil spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw. Rejuvenation (Su) Unless holy water is poured over the destroyed remains of a demi-lich, the creature reforms in 1d10 days with a successful level check (1d20 + demi-lich's HD) against DC 16. Trap the Soul (Su) A demi-lich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw. If the target makes its saving throw, it gains three negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demi-lich's mouth. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demi-lich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at the end of that time the sou l is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demi-lich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of resurrection, true resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim protected by a death ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude save and is effective against the level loss on a successful save. The save DC is Charisma-based. Unholy Grace (Su) A demi-lich adds its Charisma modifier as a bonus on its saving throws and as a profane bonus to its Armor Class. Vorpal Susceptibility (Su) Vorpal weapons, no matter their enhancement bonus, ignore a demi-lich's DR but do only half damage to a demi-lich (demi-liches cannot be beheaded).																												
Demilich	14.00	38400	Tiny	7	25, touch 21, flat-footed 21	142	15	15	8	channel resistance +5, rejuvenation, unholy grace		torpor, vorpal susceptibility	fly 30 ft. (perfect)			2-1/2 ft.	0 ft.	devour soul	Str 6, Dex 17, Con -, Int 21, Wis 20, Cha 21	11	8	18	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Devour Soul (Su) As a standard action with a range of 300 feet, a demilich can imprison the soul of a living creature within one of 10 special gems embedded in its skull. If the target succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save, it gains two permanent negative levels. If it fails, its soul is immediately drawn into one of the gems in the demilich's skull. The soul remains trapped within the gem, visible as but a gleam except under true seeing. The soulless body corrupts and decays rapidly, reducing to dust in a single round. As long as the dead creature's soul remains trapped in the gemstone, it cannot be  restored to life via any means save direct divine intervention. Gems with souls trapped in them can be retrieved from a destroyed demilich, at which point they can either be crushed to release any souls within to their afterlife or used in the place of the usual material components to restore the soul and body with resurrection or true resurrection. After 24 hours, the demilich can choose to consume any soul trapped in a gem, healing it 1d6 hit points per Hit Die of the soul, at which point only miracle or wish can restore the dead creature to life. The save DC is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 bonus for the Ability Focus feat.  Greater Bestow Curse (Sp) This spell-like ability functions like bestow curse, but can have one of the following effects: -12 to one ability score; -6 to two ability scores; -8 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks; or a 25% chance to act normally. This ability is treated as a 6th-level spell.  Immunity to Magic (Su) A demilich is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A dispel evil spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw.  • Holy smite affects a demilich normally.  • A power word kill spoken by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the demilich if it fails a Fortitude save (with a DC determined as though the spell allowed a saving throw).  • A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw.  Rejuvenation (Su) A destroyed demilich reforms in 2d6 days. To permanently destroy a demilich, holy water must be poured over its remains within the area of a hallow spell. To complete the destruction, holy word or dispel evil must be cast. If the caster succeeds at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the demilich's Hit Dice, the demilich is permanently destroyed.  Telekinetic Storm (Su) As a special use of its telekinesis spell-like ability, a demilich can churn up its treasure, dust, bones, and other loose debris in the area into a whirling storm about its skull. The storm obscures vision as a fog cloud within a 20-foot spread centered on the demilich's skull. Creatures within the storm take 12d6 points of bludgeoning damage per round on the demilich's turn (Reflex DC 20 half). The demilich can maintain the storm indefinitely by concentrating.  Torpor (Ex) A demilich takes no actions against intruders unless its remains or treasure are disturbed.  Unholy Grace (Su) A demilich gains a bonus on saves and a profane bonus to AC equal to its Charisma modifier.  Vorpal Susceptibility (Ex) Vorpal weapons of any kind ignore a demilich's damage reduction.

Tentacle Cage (Su) If a gylou successfully grapples a creature, she transfers that creature into her lower body's nest of cage-like tentacles. This works like swallow whole. The gylou's tentacles are AC 17 and have 18 hp for the purpose of an entrapped creature cutting itself out. A gylou's tendrils heal quickly, allowing her to use this ability 1 round after a creature cuts itself free.																												
Feranth	14.00	38400	Huge	-2	29, touch 6, flat-footed 29	218	16	9	11	ferocity, hardened body			50 ft., burrow 30 ft.	bite +25 (2d6+8), 2 claws +25 (1d8+8), gore +25 (2d6+8 plus push)		15 ft.	15 ft.	ambush, burrowing charge, push (gore, 10 ft.), quick strike, skull-splitting roar	Str 26, Dex 7, Con 20, Int 4, Wis 17, Cha 7	19	+29 (+31 bull rush)	37 (39 vs. bull rush, 41 vs. trip)	AP 90	Ambush (Ex) When a feranth charges, instead of making an attack at the end of the charge, it can instead use its skull-splitting roar ability, although the DC to resist this ability is 4 lower when the ability is used in this fashion.  Burrowing Charge (Ex) A feranth can use the charge and run actions while burrowing.  Hardened Body (Ex) A feranth's natural attacks count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and hardness.  Quick Strike (Ex) Whenever a feranth successfully dazes a creature using its skull-splitting roar ability, it can make an attack of opportunity against that creature. A feranth can use this ability against only one target per round, no matter how many creatures it successfully dazes.  Skull-Splitting Roar (Ex) As a standard action, a feranth can unleash a terrible roar, affecting all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Any creatures in the area of the cone must succeed  at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round and deafened for 1 minute. A feranth can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Flying Polyp	14.00	38400	Huge	6	29, touch 16, flat-footed 26	207	13	12	16	amorphous, deflecting winds, partial invisibility	25	vulnerable to electricity	30 ft., fly 60 ft. (perfect)	4 tentacles +21 (1d8+9/19-20 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	constrict (1d8+9), sucking wind, wind blast	Str 28, Dex 15, Con 24, Int 19, Wis 20, Cha 21	13	+24 (+28 grapple)	42 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Deflecting Winds (Su) A flying polyp's mastery over air and wind allows it to surround itself with blasts of precisely aimed gusts, granting the creature a +5 deflection bonus to its Armor Class and a +4 resistance bonus on Reflex saving throws.  Partial Invisibility (Su) A flying polyp's body constantly flickers and shifts, passing from visibility to invisibility in a seemingly random pattern and often not wholly at once, leaving the creature's body in what appear to be multiple sections. This ability, combined with the flying polyp's amorphous, elastic form, makes it difficult to target the creature, granting it a 20% miss chance against all attacks. By concentrating, a flying polyp can become fully invisible. Sucking Wind (Su) This attack allows the flying polyp to send an eerie wind out to slow and eventually stop a creature's escape. The wind itself isn't particularly strong, but it creates a peculiar sucking sensation as if it were attempting to pull creatures back toward the flying polyp. Activating this ability is a full-round action, and it must concentrate each round to maintain the effect. The sucking wind manifests as a 100-foot-radius spread, with the flying polyp at the center. Each round the polyp maintains concentration, the sucking wind's radius increases by 100 feet, to a maximum radius of a mile. A flying polyp can detect creatures within this area via tremorsense. As a free action, it can increase the effects of the sucking wind on up to five different creatures within the area at one time. Each targeted creature must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area of the sucking wind or it is slowed until it leaves the area. A creature already under the effects of any slowing effect (such as from this sucking wind or a slow spell) that fails this save is held in place for 1 round-it is not helpless, but cannot move via any means. Freedom of movement protects against the effects of the sucking wind, and control winds negates its effects in the area of effect of the control winds spell. Natural windstorms or other powerful winds have no effect on a sucking wind. A flying polyp can activate a sucking wind once per day, and can maintain concentration on the effect for up to an hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Wind Blast (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a flying polyp can create a powerful blast of wind at a range of up to 120 feet. This blast of wind creates a sudden explosion of flesh-scouring wind in a 30-foot-radius burst. All creatures within this area take 14d6 points of bludgeoning damage, with a successful DC 26 Reflex save halving the damage. In addition, these winds can check or blow away creatures as if they were tornado-strength winds (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439). The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Furnace Golem	14.00	38400	Huge	-1	29, touch 7, flat-footed 29	144	6	5	6				20 ft.	2 slams +28 (4d6+11 plus 2d6 fire plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	breath weapon (50-ft. line, 10d6 fire, Reflex DC 19 half, every 1d4 rounds), furnace-interior, heat	Str 32, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	19	+32 (+36 grapple)	41	Tome of Horrors Complete	Furnace-Interior (Ex) A furnace golem can try to shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes smaller than itself into its interior by making a successful grapple check. An opponent thrown into the furnace golem's interior is trapped as a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round. A trapped creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round. Escaping the creature's interior requires a successful Strength check (DC 30) to bend the bars. Alternately a trapped creature can escape by dealing at least 25 points of damage to the bars (AC 22). Note, the golem's damage reduction applies to all attacks against the bars. A Huge furnace golem's interior can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 16 Tiny or smaller creatures. Heat (Ex) A furnace golem's entire form is extremely hot. Any slam attack deals fire damage. Creatures attacking a furnace golem unarmed or with natural weapons take this same fire damage each time one of their attacks hits. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A furnace golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below. A magical attack that bypasses its cold resistance slows a furnace golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the furnace golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of damage would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

In addition, unattended objects in the area of a gray goo take damage if the swarm chooses to harm them. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Dispersion (Ex) As an immediate action, a gray goo can disperse, spreading itself across an area of up to 30 cubic feet. While dispersed, it deals no damage and cannot use its other special abilities until it reforms. A dispersed gray goo can hide in plain sight (as a ranger in its favored terrain) with a +10 bonus and does not take additional damage from area effects. It takes 2 rounds for a dispersed gray goo to reform.  Infest (Ex) As a standard action, a gray goo can infest a Medium or larger creature (Fortitude DC 21 negates), including constructs and undead. The swarm deals double its normal damage to its host each round, but cannot make use of its dismantle ability. If the host is reduced to 0 hit points while infested, it is reduced to dust and destroyed (similar to a disintegrate effect).  A gray goo infesting a host can be expelled by any effect that cures disease, with a disease save equal to this ability's DC. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.																												
Great White Whale	14.00	38400	Colossal	-2	28, touch 0, flat-footed 28	225	21	9	8				swim 40 ft.	bite +25 (6d6+20/19-  20), tail slap +20 (3d6+10)		30 ft.	30 ft.	capsize, smashing breach	Str 50, Dex 6,  Con 27, Int 2,  Wis 11, Cha 5	13	41	49 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Smashing Breach (Ex) As a full-round action, a great white whale can make a special charge attack against creatures on the surface of the water. At the end of its charge, the whale breaches, then slams down onto the target with incredible force. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the whale's space must make a DC 27 Reflex save or take 4d8+30 points of bludgeoning damage and be forced into the nearest square that is adjacent to the whale. This breach automatically attempts to capsize any boats caught wholly or partially in this area. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Gunpowder Ooze	14.00	38400	Large	0	9, touch 9, flat-footed 9	230	13	6	1	split (slashing or fire, 46 hp)		vulnerable to fire	20 ft., climb 20 ft.	slam +23 (1d8+13 plus grab and gunpowder residue)	blast +14 touch (4d6+7 plus gunpowder residue)	10 ft.	10 ft.	combust, constrict (1d8+13)	Str 28, Dex 11, Con 24, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1	15	+25 (+29 grapple)	35 (39 vs. grapple, can't be tripped)	Wardens Of The Reborn Forge	Blast (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a gunpowder ooze can fire a concentrated blast of gunpowder from its body as a ranged touch attack, dealing damage equal to 4d6 + the ooze's Constitution modifier (+7 for most gunpowder oozes). Any creature struck by this blast is also potentially exposed to the ooze's gunpowder residue (Reflex DC 27 negates).  This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Combust (Ex) Because of the volatile nature of its composition, a gunpowder ooze is susceptible to combusting when an ignition source is present.  Anytime a gunpowder ooze takes fire damage or damage from a ranged firearm attack, it spontaneously explodes, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects in a 30-foot-burst cone toward the damage source that ignited the ooze. If there is no method of determining the damage source's direction (such as a burst or spread centered on the ooze), the ooze instead combusts in a 15-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 27 Reflex save halves the damage taken from this attack. A gunpowder ooze that combusts automatically splits. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Gunpowder Residue (Ex) Whenever a gunpowder ooze successfully strikes a creature with its blast or slam attack, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Reflex save to avoid being coated in sticky gunpowder residue. Though the residue is not harmful in itself, if a creature covered in the residue uses a firearm, wields any weapon capable of dealing fire damage, takes fire damage from any source, or is exposed to a suitable spark, the residue immediately ignites and explodes, dealing 5d6 points of fire damage to the creature. Creatures adjacent to the exploding creature take half damage (Reflex DC 27 half). Gunpowder residue remains flammable for 24 hours, until it is ignited, or until it is scrubbed away (which requires soap, water, and at least 1 hour of bathing and washing). A creature can only be covered in one layer of gunpowder residue at a time.  The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Handmaiden Devil	14.00	38400	Medium	11	31, touch 17, flat-footed 24	187	16	16	10		25		40 ft., fly 60 ft. (average)	2 claws +22 (2d8+7/19-20/x3), 2 tentacles +20 (1d6+3  plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft. (10 ft. with tentacle)	tentacle cage (4d8+10 bludgeoning, AC 17, 18 hp)	Str 24, Dex 25, Con 25, Int 22, Wis 21, Cha 20	15	+22 (+26 grapple)	39 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Agile Grappler (Ex) A gylou does not gain the grappled condition if she grapples a foe.  Tentacle Cage (Su) If a gylou successfully grapples a creature, she transfers that creature into her lower body's nest of cage-like tentacles. This works like swallow whole. The gylou's tentacles are AC 17 and have 18 hp for the purpose of an entrapped creature cutting itself out. A gylou's tendrils heal quickly, allowing her to use this ability 1 round after a creature cuts itself free.																												
Ice Yai	14.00	38400	Large	2	27, touch 12, flat-footed 24	200	17	7	12		25	vulnerability to fire	50 ft., fly 60 ft.

This dart is a ranged touch attack (+20 attack bonus), dealing 4d6 points of cold damage on a hit. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment.  Staggering Strikes (Ex) An ice yai can strike twice per round with its two slam attacks. A creature struck  by more than two of these slam attacks in a round must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Indarugant	14.00	38400	Huge	2	29, touch 11, flat-footed 26	190	10	10	16	channel resistance +4	25		30 ft. (40 ft. without armor)	battleaxe +23/+18/+13 (3d6+15/19-20/x3) or   2 slams +23 (1d8+10 plus curse of frozen flesh)	rock +16 (2d6+10)	15 ft.	15 ft.	curse of frozen flesh, lingering curses, rock throwing (120 ft.)	Str 31, Dex 14, Con -, Int 12, Wis 19, Cha 19	15	27	40	AP 94	Curse of Frozen Flesh (Su) Slam-contact; save Will DC 24; effect Creature gains vulnerability to cold. Anytime the cursed creature fails a saving throw against a spell or effect with the cold descriptor, it is also slowed for 1d4 rounds.  Lingering Curses (Su) An indarugant is an accursed creature, and so has dominion over misfortune and curses. An indarugant can apply the effects of its curse of frozen flesh with its bestow curse spell-like ability (in place of bestow curse's normal effects). Additionally, the DC of any attempt to remove a curse inflicted by the indarugant increases by 5. If a caster level check to remove an indarugant's curse fails by 5 or more, the curse appears to be lifted and is temporarily suppressed until the next time the victim enters combat or is otherwise faced with a life-threatening situation (subject to the GM's discretion).																												
Juggernaut Beetle	14.00	38400	Huge	-1	29, touch 7, flat-footed 29	210	17	11	7	selective mind		light sensitivity	30 ft.	bite +28 (4d10+15/19-20)		15 ft.	10 ft.	breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 8d6 acid damage, Reflex DC 25 half, usable once every 1d4 rounds), trample (2d8+15, DC 30)	Str 31, Dex 9, Con 20, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 8	20	+32 (+34 bull rush)	41 (43 vs. bull rush or trip)	Monster Codex	Selective Mind (Su): To anyone but duergar, these beetles count as mindless. Duergar can affect them with mind-affecting effects, and train and control them as if the beetles were animals.																												
Kakuen-taka	14.00	38400	Huge	10	16, touch 15, flat-footed 9	199	17	20	10	fleshy shield	25		30 ft.	swarm (5d6 plus dimensional snare and distraction), 2 slams +19 (5d6)		15 ft.	0 ft. (10 ft. with slam)	consume flesh, trample (5d6, DC 20)	Str 10, Dex 23, Con 16, Int 6, Wis 13, Cha 13	21	23	40 (can't be tripped)	Inner Sea Bestiary	Consume Flesh (Su) Once per round, when a kakuen-taka kills or reduces a creature to negative hit points with its swarm attack, it automatically attempts to consume the target's flesh as a free action (Fortitude DC 24 negates). If the target fails its save, its body is destroyed and the kakuen-taka gains the benefits of a death knell spell. This is a death attack.  Create Carrionstorm (Ex) As a full-round action at sunrise, a kakuen-taka (a bhoga swarm with a flesh mansion) can create 1d4 carrionstorms (see page 408 of the Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition). These carrionstorms have a blinding poison in addition to their swarm attack. The carrionstorms are not under the control of the kakuen-taka but instinctively follow it, attacking minor foes while the kakuen-taka destroys greater threats. If the flesh mansion is destroyed and the kakuen-taka does not create another one within 24 hours, the carrionstorms are destroyed.  Any carrionstorms in excess of four wander away from the kakuen-taka and are automatically destroyed 24 hours later.  Carrionstorm Poison (Ex) Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 12, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect permanent blindness, cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based (using the carrionstorm's Constitution).  Dimensional Snare (Su) Any creature affected by the kakuen-taka's swarm attack must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be affected by dimensional anchor for 1 round. This save is Charisma-based.  Flesh Mansion (Ex) A kakuen-taka's bhoga swarm normally inhabits a hollowed-out reconfigured corpse called a flesh mansion, which it uses as a shelter, vehicle, and war machine. When the swarm wears a flesh mansion, it uses the above stat block (unlike a normal swarm, the flesh mansion's slam attacks have reach and threaten squares within its reach). As a standard action, the swarm can abandon its flesh mansion (which falls inert in its square), inhabit an empty flesh mansion, hide within its flesh mansion (gaining cover against all opponents but still being able to use its swarm attack), or stop hiding within the flesh mansion. If the flesh mansion is destroyed, the swarm can create another by performing a ritual that requires 1 hour and the corpse of a Huge creature. The flesh mansion is not a separate creature, nor is it undead; it is merely a corpse the swarm manipulates. Without a flesh mansion, the bhoga swarm's statistics are CE Diminutive outsider (chaotic, evil, extraplanar, swarm); AC 22, touch 21, flat-footed 15; Defensive Abilities swarm traits; Melee swarm (5d6 plus dimensional snare and distraction); Reach 0 ft.; Str 1; CMB -; CMD - (can't be tripped); Stealth +32.  Fleshy Shield (Ex) A newly created flesh mansion has 150 hit points. The swarm takes only half damage from all attacks that deal hit point damage, with the remainder taken by the flesh mansion. Because a swarm of Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage, apply half of all weapon damage to the fleshy shield and ignore the half that would be applied to the swarm. When the flesh mansion reaches 0 hit points, it is destroyed and the swarm functions like a normal swarm (see Flesh Mansion above). A kakuen-taka can repair a damaged flesh mansion by spending a full-round action grafting a corpse into it (restoring 5 hit points for a Small corpse, 10 for Medium, 20 for Large, 50 for Huge).																												
Leng Spider	14.00	38400	Huge	13	29, touch 17, flat-footed 20	202	17	18	10		25		40 ft., climb 40 ft.	mwk flail +22/+17/+12 (3d6+8), bite +16 (2d6+4 plus poison)	mwk bolas +23 (1d8+8)	15 ft.	15 ft.	web (+24 ranged, DC 25, 15 hp), web weaponry	Str 26, Dex 29, Con 26, Int 21, Wis 17, Cha 22	15	25	44 (54 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con plus confusion for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. A Leng spider's venom causes flesh to blister and rot away and the mind to experience vivid and horrific hallucinations-these visions cause the poisoned creature to react in an unpredictable manner, as if confused. The hallucination element of this poison is mind-affecting. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Web Weaponry (Ex) A Leng spider is talented at using its webs to construct masterwork weapons. This technique of weapon creation allows the spider to effectively create a flail or bolas by attaching a heavy object such as a rock or chunk of metal to a cord of webbing. The spider attaches one end of this webbing to a leg and can then wield the weighted cord as a masterwork flail or a masterwork bolas. It can only wield one such weapon at a time-it must use its other legs to walk. If a Leng spider drops or loses a web weapon, it can create a new one as a full-round action, provided it has access to heavy-weight objects of the correct size (such as loose rocks or skulls).

Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 24) or be destroyed.  Electricity Aura (Su) A mature adult blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.																												
Mature Adult Bronze Dragon	14.00	38400	Huge	4	31, touch 8, flat-footed 31	207	16	11	16		25		40 ft., fly 200 ft.

Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.  Wave Mastery (Su) For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.																												
Mezlan	14.00	38400	Medium	11	30, touch 18, flat-footed 22	195	12	14	11		25		40 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.	2 morphic weapons +22 (2d8+10)	morphic weapon +19 (2d8+10)	5 ft.	5 ft. (15 ft. with 1 slam per round)	sneak attack +3d6, spell battery (chain lightning [DC 19], dispel magic, mage armor)	Str 30, Dex 25, Con 24, Int 15, Wis 18, Cha 17	12	22	40 (can't be tripped)	AP 66	Morphic Body (Ex) A mezlan can assume the appearance of any Medium or Small creature (other than creatures with the elemental, incorporeal, or swarm subtypes-the body assumed must be solid). The mezlan's creature type doesn't change in this new form and it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities; the transformation is cosmetic only. In these other forms, the mezlan retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as depicted above. Though this ability only affects the mezlan's outward image, it is a transmutation effect.  Morphic Weapons (Ex) A mezlan can manipulate its body to mimic a wide array of potent weaponry wielded by its various forms. While the weapons may look different, they are considered natural weapons and they all do the same amount of damage; are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction; and deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once per round, a mezlan can extend one of its limbs to strike at a distance up to 15 feet away with one of its slam attacks. Also, while mimicking a creature wielding a ranged weapon, a mezlan can fire a portion of its body as if the fragment were a projectile. This projectile is treated as a thrown weapon and has a range increment of 60 feet.  Skill Pool (Ex) A mezlan has a special knack for solving problems. Five times per day, it can apply a +4 competence bonus on any skill check, even checks for skills it has no ranks in or skills that can only be used untrained.  Spell Battery (Su) A mezlan can store up to 10 levels of spells that it can then cast freely. The spells imbued into a mezlan are each activated with the casting time for the relevant spell and are cast at the caster level of the spellcaster who provided the spells. A mezlan can store and use both divine and arcane spells, and can be imbued by any number of casters at a time. To fuel this ability, a caster must cast her spells into the mezlan; alternatively, the spellcaster can use a scroll to place a spell into the mezlan. A mezlan must voluntarily lower its spell resistance in order to be imbued with spells.  In addition, a mezlan can choose to lower its spell resistance and absorb spells cast at it. The mezlan must be aware of the incoming spell and ready an action to absorb it. Only spells that have the mezlan as a target can be absorbed in this way; area spells are not absorbed. If a mezlan already possesses 10 levels of spells, it cannot absorb more. The mezlan can use these absorbed spells as its own.  Versatile Speech (Ex) A mezlan has a talent for parsing spoken languages. After spending 1 minute listening to a speaker use a language it doesn't already know, a mezlan can understand that language. After listening for 1 additional minute, the mezlan can speak the language. This understanding lasts for 24 hours before fading from the mezlan's mutable mind. To understand the same language again after this time, the mezlan must spend another minute listening to a creature speak that language. The mezlan doesn't have to be engaged in a conversation to use this ability.

In addition, if the troll fails a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, it can immediately attempt a second saving throw against the same effect on the next round to end the duration of the effect early.

Create Vacuum (Ex) As a standard action, a mythic elder air elemental can suck the air out of the lungs of creatures it has swallowed or that are trapped in its whirlwind (Fortitude DC 27 negates). Creatures that fail the save take 2d6 points of damage and must attempt Constitution checks each round as if they had run out of breath. An affected character can't speak, use breath weapons, cast spells with verbal components, or do anything else that requires breathing. A trapped creature that succeeds at its save must succeed at a concentration check to cast spells. The air elemental can maintain this vacuum as a move action. If it stops, the trapped or swallowed creatures can breathe again. The save DC is Strength-based.  Elevated Ejection (Ex) When a mythic air elemental in whirlwind form ejects a trapped creature, it can do so from any point up to the whirlwind's current height, dropping the creature into the whirlwind's space or within the elemental's normal reach. The creature takes falling damage as normal. If the elemental expends one use of mythic power, it can instead throw a trapped creature as if using the uncanny grapple path ability (see page 23) with no grapple check needed.  Swallow Whole (Ex) A mythic air elemental can use this ability on a creature it has grabbed. If a trapped creature cuts itself free, the hole heals itself closed at the start of the elemental's next turn, allowing it to use swallow whole again.

If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.  Petrify (Su) If it hits a target with a slam attack, a mythic earth elemental can expend two uses of mythic power to permanently turn that target to stone. If the target succeeds at a DC 23 Fortitude save, it is slowed (as the spell) for 1d6 rounds instead of petrified. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stun (Ex) If a mythic earth elemental strikes an opponent with two slams in 1 round, that creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.  Trap Weapon (Ex) A mythic earth elemental's body traps manufactured weapons that damage it. A manufactured weapon that deals hit point damage to the elemental (after subtracting its DR) is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 30 Reflex save. A creature can spend a standard action to attempt a DC 30 Strength check to remove a stuck weapon. Weapons that deal only bludgeoning damage are immune to this ability. The elemental can release any number of stuck weapons as a free action. The save DC is Strength-based.

This gaze causes permanent blindness and has a range of 60 feet. A creature that succeeds at a DC 22 Fortitude save is instead dazzled for 1 round. Fire elementals are immune to this blindness. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Inferno (Ex) A mythic fire elemental can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to lose its vulnerability to cold for 1 round. During this time, any fire damage it deals ignores fire resistance and fire immunity.  Shroud of Flame (Ex) Any creature within a mythic fire elemental's reach must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save at the start of its turn or take 2d6 points of fire damage. The elemental can suppress or reactivate this ability at will as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Smoke Cloud (Ex) As a swift action, a mythic fire elemental can create a choking cloud of smoke. This cloud is equivalent to that of pyrotechnics and lasts 1 minute. Fire elementals are immune to the effects of this ability.																												
Mythic Elder Water Elemental	14.00	38400	Huge	6	30, touch 16, flat-footed 22	202	14	18	6				20 ft., swim 90 ft.	4 slams +24 (2d10+10/18-20 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	drench, fast swallow, mythic power (5/day, surge +1d8), pressure wave, smother, swallow whole (2d10+10 bludgeoning damage, AC 14, 20 hp, DR 10/-), vortex (at will, 10-60 ft., 2d10+10 damage, DC 28), water mastery	Str 30, Dex 22, Con 19, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 11	16	+28 (+30 bull rush or sunder, +32 grapple)	48 (50 vs. bull rush or sunder)	Mythic Adventures	Drench (Ex) The elemental's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level 16th).  Pressure Wave (Su) A mythic water elemental can expend one use of mythic power to create a 60-foot-radius bust of pressurized water. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 22 Fort save. Success means the creature is sickened for 1d4 rounds; failure means the creature is nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1d4 rounds after that. If the elemental expends two uses of mythic power, creatures nauseated by this ability also take slam damage. Creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Swallow Whole (Ex) The elemental can use this ability on a creature it has grabbed. If a trapped creature cuts itself free, the hole heals itself closed at the start of the elemental's next turn, allowing it to use swallow whole again.  Vortex (Su) A water elemental can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will (as a whirlwind [Bestiary 306], but only underwater and cannot leave the water).  Water Mastery (Ex) If a water elemental and its opponent are touching water, the elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and bull rush and overrun combat maneuver checks. If it or the opponent are touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, on damage rolls, and to its CMD to resist bull rush and overrun attempts.

One round later, the light bursts in a 60-foot radius. Any non-demon creature caught within this area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of madness hound it. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Nightwing	14.00	38400	Huge	8	29, touch 12, flat-footed 25	195	12	11	17		25	light aversion	30 ft., fly 60 ft. (good)	bite +23 (4d10+18/19- 20 plus 4d6 cold and magic drain)		15 ft.	15 ft.	channel energy (7d6, DC 28, 8/day)	Str 31, Dex 18, Con -, Int 18, Wis 21, Cha 21	12	24	38	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Magic Drain (Su) The bite of a nightwing drains magical power and energy. When a nightwing bites a foe, the victim must make a DC 23 Will save or one spell effect currently affecting him immediately ends-determine which spell is drained randomly if the target is under the effects of more than one spell. The nightwing heals damage equal to twice the level of the spell drained-hit points in excess of its maximum are instead gained as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. If a nightwing attempts to sunder a magic item with its bite, its magic-draining bite renders the item nonmagical for 1d4 rounds (if the item is a permanent magic item), drains 1d8 charges (if the item has charges), or renders it permanently nonmagical (if the item is a one-use item). The item (or its wielder, if the item is attended) can resist this effect with a DC 23 Will save. Damage dealt to an item is applied after the effects of magic drain are applied. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Noble Time Elemental	14.00	38400	Large	9	25, touch 19, flat-footed 19	190	10	19	18	foresight	25		fly 20 ft. (perfect)	2 slams +24 (2d6+4)		10 ft.	10 ft.	alter age 1/day (Fort DC 24), multi-manifestation, temporal displacement 3/day (20 minutes, Fort DC 24)	Str 18, Dex 20, Con 18, Int 18, Wis 18, Cha 15	20	25	45	Tome of Horrors Complete	Alter Age (Su) Once per day, a noble time elemental can age a creature simply by touching it (this requires a melee touch attack). If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack. An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age. A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger). Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day. Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell. Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common). Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spell-like abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time. Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all. Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell. Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day. Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based. Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD).

An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence. Crush (Ex) A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus. Speak with Reptiles (Sp) A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals. Swamp Stride (Ex) A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. Water Breathing (Ex) A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

This functions as gust of wind, but any creature in its path must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand.  Fire Aura (Su) An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient brass dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A brass dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.  Move Sand (Su) A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell.  Sleep Breath (Su) Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a 50 ft. cone of sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+8 rounds.

This ability otherwise functions as greater teleport (caster level 14th), but the peri can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.  Smoke Sight (Su) A peri can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty.  Whirlwind Dance (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a peri can spin in an ever-faster, whirling dance, transforming  itself into a spinning vortex of flame 10 to 40 feet high for up to 9 rounds. This ability functions as the whirlwind ability (DC 26 Reflex save), but any creature that comes in contact with the whirlwind or is caught inside it takes 2d6+6 points of fire damage and is subject to the peri's burn special attack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

No Sleep (Ex) A rokurokubi does not need to sleep and is immune to all sleep effects.  Rokurokubi's Curse (Su) Bite-injury; save Will DC 23; frequency 1 day; effect 1 Cha damage and permanently silenced after 4 Cha damage. Fully healing the Cha damage cures the silence.

The arm is Huge and has a space of 15 ft. and a reach of 20 ft. The arm and fist cannot move from the location where it was created. The sand giant can order the arm to attack a target as a move action. Once given a target, the arm automatically attacks that target on the giant's turn. The arm remains for a number of rounds equal to the sand giant's Hit Dice (19 rounds for a typical sand giant). A sand giant does not need to concentrate to maintain the arm and can direct it to attack a new target or adapt a new tactic as a free action. The arm's base attack bonus is equal to that of the giant that created it, and it deals slam damage equal to the slam attack for a creature of its size (Huge). Any creature struck must succeed on a DC 29 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based, using the HD of the sand giant and the Strength of the fist of sand. The arm has an AC of 20 (+12 natural, -2 size) and has hit points equal to three times the Constitution score of the sand giant that created it. It has a Strength score of 30. The arm loses shape if it is reduced to 0 or less hit points, the duration expires, or the sand giant dies. Weapon and Armor Proficiency (Ex) Sand giants are automatically proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields.

Rain of Debris (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a sepid can call forth a hail of stones, wood, metal, and similar debris. The debris rains down and pelts all creatures in a 10-foot-high, 40-foot-radius cylinder centered on the sepid, dealing 15d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 25 half ). This attack does not harm the sepid, and counts as an evil attack for the purpose of damage reduction. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Any creature that is struck by the blast and fails its saving throw is pushed back 10 feet as though bull rushed. For every 5 by  which a creature fails its saving throw, it is pushed back an additional 5 feet. This effect also extinguishes any normal fires within the line of effect, as well as magical fires, which are dispelled as though by greater dispel magic. A suijin can choose to have its breath weapon deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage before using this ability.  Whitewater Barrier (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a suijin can create a wall of turbulent water. A suijin can make this barrier however long it wishes, up to a maximum length of 180 feet, and the wall is 20 feet tall. A whitewater barrier acts as a sheet of stormy water, and any Large or smaller creature that attempts to pass through the barrier must succeed at a DC 26 Swim check or be rushed to the top of the wave and pushed back to the side it started on, taking fall damage as appropriate. It is possible to create cylindrical or square whitewater barriers to enclose specific points. This effect acts like wind wall in regard to how ranged missiles, breath weapons, gases, and creatures in gaseous form interact with it. The Swim DC is Constitution-based.

All damage dealt to a surgeon robot with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the surgeon robot is immune to critical hits. A surgeon robot's force field has fast healing 15, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate for 24 hours.  Master Surgeon (Ex) Programmed to execute advanced medical procedures, a surgeon robot can perform surgeries and other procedures that heal humanoid creatures of all manner of maladies. A surgeon robot can heal wounds, set broken bones, cure diseases, treat burns, remove poison, and even install cybertech items. These procedures take varying amounts of time for the surgeon robot to complete and require different Heal check DCs. The DCs for these surgical procedures increase by 10 when they're performed on a non-humanoid creature. These procedures leave the patient with the exhausted condition. If the surgeon robot fails any of its Heal checks, the surgery fails and the patient takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and is exhausted for 24 hours. The procedures a surgeon robot can perform are as follows:  • Cure Blindness/Deafness (DC 35): The patient's sight or hearing is restored. Required Time: 30 minutes.  • Install Cybertech (DC = 5 + the cybertech install DC): Cybernetic equipment is installed safely. Required Time: 20 minutes per point of implantation of the cybertech being installed.  • Minor Surgery (DC 25): The patient is healed of 1d8+1 points of damage. Required Time: 5 minutes.  • Moderate Surgery (DC 30): The patient is healed of 2d8+3 points of damage and 1d4+1 points of ability damage to a selected ability score. Required Time: 10 minutes.  • Major Surgery (DC 35): The patient is healed of 3d8+5 points of damage and is cured of blindness and deafness. Required Time: 15 minutes.  • Critical Surgery (DC 40): The patient is healed of 4d8+7 points of damage and either all ability damage to all ability scores or all ability drain to one ability score. Required Time: 30 minutes.  • Treat Toxin (DC = 10 + the save DC of disease or poison): One disease or poison currently afflicting the patient is removed. Required Time: 10 minutes.  Specialized Programming (Ex) Heal is always a class skill for surgeon robots, and they gain a +8 racial bonus on Heal checks.  Superior Optics (Ex) Surgeon robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.  Syringe (Ex) When a surgeon robot makes a successful attack with its syringe, it can inject the target with pharmaceuticals. The robot contains nanites that fabricate the pharmaceuticals stored within its body. Up to 10 doses of these pharmaceuticals can be administered per day. The surgeon robot can choose to affect its target with cardioamp, cureall, hemochem (grade III), torpinal, or zortaphen each time it uses this ability. Rules for these pharmaceuticals can be found on pages 33-34 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide.

This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Reaper's Curse (Su) Those in proximity to a temerdaemon are afflicted by a profound increase in self-inflicted and ally-inflicted wounds, failures in magic, and similar accidental damage. Arcane spell failure chances for armor are doubled. A creature that rolls a natural 1 on its attack roll automatically rerolls the attack against itself (01-50%) or an ally (51-100%). If there is no ally in range, the attack always targets the creature. A creature that rolls a natural 1 on its roll to cast defensively suffers a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps, Core Rulebook 491). Skill checks that have serious consequences if failed by 5 or more (such as Climb, Disable Device, and Swim) have these consequences on all failed checks.

The archon can also command its trumpet to become a +4 greatsword as a free action. Out of the archon's hands, it is a chunk of useless metal.																												
Veiled Master	14.00	38400	Large	10	30, touch 15, flat-footed 24	200	13	13	14		25		10 ft., swim 80 ft.	bite +17 (2d6+6 plus consume memory and slime), 2 claws +17 (1d6+6 plus slime), 4 tentacles +12 touch (2d6+3 electricity plus thoughtlance)		10 ft.	10 ft. (20 ft. with claws and tentacles)	delayed suggestion, mucus cloud	Str 22, Dex 22, Con 27, Int 21, Wis 19, Cha 22	12	19	35 (can't be tripped)	Inner Sea Bestiary	Consume Memory (Su) When a veiled master bites a creature, it consumes some of that creature's memories. The creature bitten must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or gain one negative level. A veiled master heals 5 points of damage each time it grants a negative level in this way, and also learns some of the target creature's memories (subject to the GM's discretion). This is a mind-affecting effect. A veiled master can suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Delayed Suggestion (Sp) Whenever a veiled master successfully uses dominate person or dominate monster on a creature, it can also implant a delayed suggestion that triggers when dominate effect ends. Typically, this suggestion (which functions as a spell-like ability, CL 20th, Will DC 19 negates) is for the previously dominated creature to seek out the veiled master again and submit to a new domination attempt, but sometimes, a veiled master implants other suggestions (such as a suggestion to attack the first person it sees).  Mucus Cloud (Ex) While underwater, a veiled master exudes a cloud of transparent slime in a 30-foot-radius spread. All creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Runemastery (Ex) A veiled master is particularly skilled at casting spells that create magical writing, such as explosive runes, secret page, or any spell with the word "symbol" in its name. It never requires material components or focus components when casting such spells, and the save DC of any of these spells increases by 1. A veiled master's symbol spells are difficult to disarm-the Disable Device DC for these symbols increases by 2.  Slime (Ex) A creature hit by any of a veiled master's bite or claw attacks must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or have its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spells A veiled master can cast spells as a 12th-level sorcerer.  Swift Transformation (Su) A veiled master can use its change shape ability as a swift action.  Thoughtlance (Su) Four of a veiled master's tentacles end in glowing spheres of light. These spheres deal 2d6 points of electricity damage on a touch attack, and also blast a creature's mind with waves of mental energy-a creature touched by one of these tentacles (regardless of whether the touch deals electricity damage) must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. Additional touches increase the duration by 1 round. While a creature is staggered in this manner, it must make concentration checks to cast spells as if it were experiencing extremely violent motion while casting (DC = 20 + spell level). The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Vemerak	14.00	38400	Huge	7	29, touch 11, flat-footed 26	195	13	8	13		25		40 ft., burrow 20 ft., climb 40 ft.	bite +22 (2d6+11), 2 claws +22 (1d8+11 plus grab),  3 tentacles +19 (1d6+5 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	breath weapon (90-foot line, 14d8 acid damage, DC 24 half, once every 1d4 rounds), constrict (tentacles 1d6+5 or claws 1d8+11), earthquake	Str 32, Dex 17, Con 23, Int 5, Wis 16, Cha 22	12	+25 (+29 grapple)	38 (50 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Breath Weapon (Su) A vemerak's acidic breath weapon has no effect on inorganic or undead material. If the breath weapon deals damage to a living fleshy creature, the acid creates a transparent cloud of foul-smelling vapor that fills that creature's space and persists for 1 round. Any creature in or passing through the cloud must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This cloud is a poison effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Earthquake (Su) As a full-round action, a vemerak can burrow its tentacles, legs, and mouth into the ground-this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At the start of the next round, it creates an effect identical to an earthquake spell (CL 17th). A vemerak can maintain this zone of trembling earth indefinitely, as long as it continues to take full-round actions to maintain the effect.  Spore Cloud (Su) A unique form of magic-resistant mold grows upon the body of a vemerak. This mold is the source of the vemerak's spell resistance. When the vemerak moves, the mold exudes a cloud of spores in a 30-foot radius that acts as a targeted greater dispel magic (CL 17th) against the highest caster level magical effect the cloud touches as part of the vemerak's move that turn.																												
Very Old Gray Dragon	14.00	36400	Huge	4	36, touch 8, flat-footed 36	237	17	13	17		25		60 ft., fly 200 ft.

(15 ft. with bite)	breath weapon (100-ft. line, 18d6 fire; DC 25 Ref half)	Str 31, Dex 10, Con 23, Int 17, Wis 19, Cha 17	19	31	41 (45 vs. trip)	Tome of Horrors 4	Breath Weapon (Su) A gray dragon's breath weapon is a superheated line of steam.  Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)  A gray dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.  • Young-fog cloud;  • Juvenile-create water;  • Old-control winds;  • Ancient-control water;  Water Breathing (Ex) A gray dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.																												
Very Old White Dragon	14.00	38400	Huge	4	34, touch 8, flat-footed 34	237	17	13	14		25	Vulnerability to fire	30 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 200 ft.

(15 ft. with bite)	breath weapon (50-ft. cone, DC 25, 18d4 cold), crush (Small Creatures, DC 25, 2d8+15), freezing fog (3/day, DC 18)	Str 31, Dex 10, Con 23, Int 14, Wis 17, Cha 14	19	31	41 (45 vs. trip)	d20pfsrd	Freezing Fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.  Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.																												
Volcano Giant	14.00	38400	Huge	1	29, touch 9, flat-footed 28	201	18	7	9	rock catching		vulnerability to cold	40 ft.

Affected creatures must make a successful DC 26 Fortitude save or take a -4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, checks and saves for 1 minute (10 rounds) due to fits of coughing and choking. The save DC is Constitution-based. Oversized Weapon Use (Ex) A volcano giant wields a Gargantuan two-handed longspear without penalty.																												
Vorin	14.00	38400	Huge	8	18, touch 12, flat-footed 14	178	11	9	10				40 ft.	sting +20 (2d6+9 plus poison), bite +19 (2d6+9)	spit +15 (poison)	15 ft.	10 ft.	spit	Str 28, Dex 18, Con 23, Int 2, Wis 11, Cha 12	12	23	37	Tome of Horrors Complete	Poison (Ex) Bite or spit-injury or contact; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex and paralyzed 1d4 hours; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  An opponent struck by a blob of vorin poison spit at them is protected from its effects for a short time by any amount of worn armor-the blob strikes the armor but not the opponent's flesh. The blob of poison seeps through armor in a number of rounds equal to the armor's armor bonus (do not apply any magical bonuses). The blob can be scraped off as a move action. Natural armor does not provide any defense as the poison seeps through the opponent's pores, nor does poison delivered by a vorin's sting have the same delayed effect.  Spit (Ex) Once per round a vorin can spit a blob of sticky poison with a sickening odor at a single opponent within 50 feet (no range increment). This requires the vorin to make a successful ranged touch attack.  If struck, a target is subjected to the vorin's poison.  Water Breathing (Ex) Vorins can breathe underwater indefinitely.																												
Vydrarch	14.00	38400	Gargantuan	3	29, touch 9, flat-footed 26	199	16	14	12				20 ft., swim 60 ft.	2 bites +26 (2d8+10/19-20 plus grab), tail slap +23 (2d8+5 plus poison spines)		20 ft.	20 ft.

A creature struck by a vydrarch's tail slap attack or that strikes a vydrarch with a melee weapon without reach, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and risks being poisoned. Any creature that grapples a vydrarch takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and risks being poisoned each round.  Vydrarch poison: Spine-injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Con, 1d2 Wis; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Veil of Fog (Su) As a standard action, a vydrarch can produce a bank of fog in a 100-foot spread centered on itself. This effect is otherwise identical that created by a fog cloud spell.																												
Willow Dusk	14.00	38400	Huge	-1	27, touch 7, flat-footed 27	210	17	7	9				20 ft.	4 slams +23 (2d8+9 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	aura of misery, droning, swallow whole (2d6+9 plus 1d8 acid damage, AC 19, 21 hp)	Str 29, Dex 8, Con 21, Int 4, Wis 16, Cha 10	15	0	24	Tome of Horrors Complete	Aura of Misery (Su) Once every 1d4+1 rounds as a free action, a willow dusk can emit a wave of negative energy that affects all living creatures within 10 feet of it. Creatures within the area take 1d6 points of Charisma damage if they fail a DC 22 Will save. At Charisma 0, a creature collapses into a coma until at least 1 point of Charisma is restored. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Droning (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a willow dusk can emit a droning sound audible to a range of 100 feet. Creatures within the area that hear it, must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or enter a state of lethargy.  Affected creatures cannot move (as if held by a hold monster spell) and have no desire to take any other action or engage in combat (unless attacked first, in which case the lethargy effect is broken). The effects last for a number of rounds equal to the one-half of the willow dusk's Hit Dice (10 rounds for the typical willow dusk). A willow dusk that attacks a creature affected by this ability gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll. Whether the attack succeeds or fails, the lethargy effect is immediately broken. A creature who succeeds on his Will save is unaffected by the droning from that same willow dusk for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Worm That Walks	14.00	38400	Medium	8	23, touch 17, flat-footed 18	113	11	12	13	worm that walks traits			30 ft.	slam +10 (1d4-1 plus grab)		5 ft.	5 ft.	discorporate, grab (Large), squirming embrace	Str 8, Dex 18, Con 17, Int 20, Wis 12, Cha 10	6	+5 (+13 grapple)	26	PFRPG Bestiary 2

Str 26, Dex 15, Con 21, Int 12, Wis 16, Cha 13	17	27	40 (44 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Exploit  Stellar Conjunction (Su) A xanthos can sense the alignment of stellar objects (planets, comets, asteroids, and so on) and when they form conjunctions that allow it to use its magic for interplanetary travel. During these conjunctions, the xanthos can use its teleport spell-like ability as interplanetary teleportUM to reach any other world in its current solar system, or as plane shift to reach any known plane. A conjunction remains viable for only 10d10 hours, after which it could be days, weeks, or even months before another conjunction occurs that would once again allow travel between those two locations.																												
Xiomorn	14.00	38400	Medium	8	28, touch 19, flat-footed 19	200	12	18	14		25		40 ft., climb 40 ft.	4 claws +24 (2d4+6/19-20 plus crystallization)		5 ft.	5 ft.	crystal burst, crystallization (DC 25), rend (2 claws, 2d4+9)	Str 22, Dex 27, Con 25, Int 27, Wis 18, Cha 24	16	+22 (+24 sunder)	41 (43 vs. sunder)	The Emerald Spire	Command Stone (Sp) This ability functions as dominate monster, equivalent of a 9th-level spell, but only on creatures with the earth subtype or constructs made out of stone. When used against a construct, this ability overcomes any spell resistance, but the effects last for only 1 round per level.  Crystal Burst (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a xiomorn can create an explosion of razor-sharp crystals at a range of up to 120 feet. These crystals fill a 30-foot-radius burst and deal 12d6 points of piercing and slashing damage (Reflex DC 25 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Crystallization (Su) A creature struck by a xiomorn's claw must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Dexterity drain. On a critical hit, the claw deals 2 points of Dexterity drain on a failed save. As long as a creature suffers any of this drain, portions of its body appear as living green crystal and it gains the earth creature subtype. A creature drained to 0 Dexterity in this manner transforms into a green crystal statue, as if affected by flesh to stone. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Item Mastery (Ex) A xiomorn can always activate spell trigger and spell completion items as if the spell were on its class list. For the purposes of crafting magic items or constructs, it is treated as though it possessed all item creation feats.																												
Yah-Thelgaad	14.00	38400	Large	8	30, touch 25, flat-footed 26	200	13	11	17	carapace	25		20 ft., fly 40 ft. (perfect)	claw +22 (3d6+11 plus poison), 2 tentacles +22 (1d8+11 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	command disease, mind storm, powerful tentacles, spellstrike	Str 32, Dex 18, Con 26, Int 23, Wis 25, Cha 21	12	24	50 (62 vs. trip)	AP 88	Brain Collection (Ex) A yah-thelgaad can store up to six brains of Small or Medium creatures and use them to enhance its knowledge and power. Each stored brain grants a yah-thelgaad a cumulative +2 insight bonus to AC, concentration checks, and Knowledge checks. A yah-thelgaad can extract a brain from a helpless opponent with a coup de grace attack, or as a standard action from a body that has been dead for no more than 1 minute. A yah-thelgaad that has fewer than six collected brains gains two negative levels for each missing brain. These negative levels never become permanent, and can only be removed by replacing one of the yah-thelgaad's collected brains. The statistics presented here assume a yah-thelgaad with a full collection.  Carapace (Ex) The spikes on a yah-thelgaad's carapace make melee attacks against it hazardous. Any opponent attempting to attack a yah-thelgaad with a light weapon, unarmed strike, touch attack, or natural attack must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of bleed damage from these bristling barbs. Bleed damage from multiple failed Reflex saves does not stack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Command Disease (Su) As a swift action, a yah-thelgaad can cause a disease or infection currently afflicting a creature within 30 feet to quicken and activate, forcing the afflicted creature to immediately attempt a saving throw against the disease's effects. Those who fail immediately suffer the disease's effects. These additional saving throws count against those one must succeed at to recover from a disease, so it's possible for a victim to be cured by succeeding at enough saving throws. Any creature that has been affected by a yah-thelgaad's command disease ability (whether or not the creature succeeded at the saving throw this ability triggered) takes a -2 penalty against any mind-affecting spell or effect generated by the yah-thelgaad in the next minute.  Mind Storm (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a yah-thelgaad can employ its own brain as well as any brains kept in its blisters to create a powerful psychic vortex. When the creature activates this ability, all creatures within a 40-foot radius must succeed at DC 23 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. When a yah-thelgaad activates this ability, it can choose to absorb one of its brains as a swift action to cause one creature within the area of effect that has succumbed to the confusion  effect to instead become stunned for 1d4 rounds. A creature stunned in this manner is confused for 1d4 rounds after the stun effect ends. A yah-thelgaad generally saves this tactic for when it's faced with a particularly dangerous foe, since the stun effect forces the yah-thelgaad to lose one of its stored brains and gain 2 negative levels. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Claw-injury; save Fort DC 26; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Strength damage and nauseated for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Powerful Tentacles (Ex) A yah-thelgaad's tentacles are primary attacks.  Spells (Su) A yah-thelgaad casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. Its caster level is reduced by 2 for each negative level it gains from missing brains. A yah-thelgaad with no collected brains can't cast any of its spells.  Spellstrike (Su) Whenever a yah-thelgaad casts a spell with a range of "touch," it can deliver the spell through its claw attack as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, the yah-thelgaad can make one free melee attack with its claw as part of casting the spell. If successful, this claw attack deals its normal damage (including poison) as well as the effects of the spell.  Strange Knowledge (Ex) All knowledge skills are class skills for yah-thelgaads.

Attended items must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or lose half their hit points and gain the broken condition. Items that already possess the broken condition and fail this save are destroyed. Items that successfully save against this effect are immune to that yarahkut's dismantling gaze for 24 hours. Unattended non-magical items don't receive a saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Malfunctioning Aura (Su) A yarahkut radiates a disruptive aura that is harmful to ranged weapons within 100 feet. Mechanical projectile weapons-such as crossbows, firearms, siege weapons, and many technological weapons-have a 20% chance of not firing on each attack made within the aura's area. If a weapon in this aura has a misfire value, its misfire value increases by 2.  Wings (Ex) A yarahkut's wings are primary attacks.

Detect Gems (Sp) A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones.  Fast Flight (Ex) A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed.  Weakening Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).																												
Zombie Horde	14.00	38400	Colossal	0	13, touch 2, flat-footed 13	110	6	6	12	half damage from piercing weapons			30 ft.	horde attack (6d6)		30 ft.	5 ft.	feral rage, rend (+3d6)	Str 22, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 10	15	29	39 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Feral Rage (Ex) The horde attacks as a ruthless mob, intent only on tearing apart those that fall into their clutches. This frenzy prevents them from using any sort of tactics, and frees them from any form of control by other beings. However, the sheer force of the wave attack allows them to deal 6d6 points of damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move. This ability is lost if the horde is broken up.  Horde Traits (Ex) Hordes are not so called because of the size of the group but rather the size of the creatures that compose the horde. Unlike normal swarms, hordes are composed of Medium creatures which are usually a normal version of a creature but otherwise behave in a swarmlike manner. There are usually around 50 creatures in a horde. The net effect is that they take only half damage from piercing weapons but take normal damage from other weapons. In addition when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or lower and breaks up, unless the damage was dealt by area-affecting attacks, then 2d6 surviving members of the horde continue their attack, though now only as individual creatures. Otherwise, a horde conforms to all of the other swarm traits as described in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary.  Rend (EX) Due to the grasping and clawing nature of the zombie horde attack, any time the horde does more than 20 points of damage, add 3d6 slashing damage from the additional pulling and tearing. This ability is lost if the swarm is broken up.																												
Abysogh	15.00	51200	Gargantuan	8	29, touch 10, flat-footed 25	218	17	10	10	freedom of movement		blind	50 ft., climb 50 ft.	2 slams +27 (4d6+17/19-20)		20 ft.	20 ft.	cataclysmic roar (10d6 sonic plus deafen and stagger, DC 25), living ammunition (60 ft.), whirlwind strike	Str 45, Dex 18, Con 22, Int 6, Wis 15, Cha 7	14	+35 (+37 bull rush)	52 (54 vs. bull rush)	AP 96	Cataclysmic Roar (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, an abysogh can emit a terrible roar in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this cone take 10d6 points of sonic damage and are deafened and staggered for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 25 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates both conditions. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Freedom of Movement (Ex) An abysogh is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the spell. This effect cannot be dispelled.  Living Ammunition (Ex) When an abysogh succeeds at a combat maneuver check to initiate or maintain a grapple against a creature two or more size categories smaller than itself, it can hurl the creature anywhere within 60 feet as a free action, though if it does so after maintaining a grapple, it can't perform any of the actions that can normally be taken as part of maintaining a grapple. Regardless of the  trajectory, the hurled creature takes 6d6 points of damage from the collision and falls prone. The creature can attempt a DC 25 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid falling prone. The save DC is Constitution-based.  If the targeted square contains another creature, the abysogh makes a ranged attack against the target. A hurled Large creature deals 4d6 points of damage, a Medium creature deals 3d6 points of damage, and a Small creature deals 2d6 points of damage. The abysogh adds 1-1/2 its Strength bonus to this damage. Tiny or smaller creatures don't deal damage to the target. Whether the attack hits or not, the hurled creature lands in an empty space of the abysogh's choice adjacent to the target.  Trembling Earth (Ex) When an abysogh moves more than 5 feet in a round, its footsteps send seismic waves rippling across the ground. All creatures at least two size categories smaller than the abysogh that are standing on the ground within 20 feet of the giant at any point during its movement must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or fall prone. The save DC is Constitution-based. The vibrations also suppress tremorsense within the area for 1 round (no save).  Whirlwind Strike (Ex) An abysogh can send multiple opponents flying through the air with its sweeping slams. When an abysogh uses the full-attack action, instead of making its normal attacks, it can perform one awesome blow combat maneuver at its highest base attack bonus against each opponent within its reach. It must attempt a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent. When using this ability, the abysogh forfeits any bonuses and extra attacks granted by feats, spells, or abilities.

Luck (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon.

This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does. Cold Aura (Su) An adult white dragon radiates an aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Freezing Fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell. Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice. Ice Tomb (Sp) A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based. Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.

Arcanotheign	15.00	51200	Medium	12	27, touch 27, flat-footed 18	207	19	14	18	incorporeal, adaptive life force	31		40 ft., fly 60 ft. (perfect)	2 incorporeal touches +26 (4d6 plus energy channel)	2 eldritch blasts +26 ranged touch (4d6 plus special)	5 ft.	5 ft.	alter objects	Str -, Dex 27, Con 22, Int 31, Wis 20, Cha 27	18	26	45	AP 41	Adaptive Life Force (Su) When subject to any effect, the Arcanotheign is always treated as the most favorable alignment subtype pertaining to that effect (for example, if in the area of a holy smite, the Arcanotheign counts as a good creature, which means she takes no damage from the spell). Though she is a living creature (for the purpose of harmless spells such as deathwatch and detect undead), she counts as either a living creature or an undead creature, depending on which outcome is more favorable to her (for example, rendering her immune to both circle of death and undeath to death). Alter Objects (Su) At will, the Arcanotheign can transmute nonliving objects into different shapes (as fabricate), transform solid materials into other materials (such as wood into stone or stone into metal), or imbue physical objects with temporary life (as animate objects). These transformations last 1 minute before reverting to their previous state, though the herald can extend this duration as long as she concentrates and remains within 1,000 feet of the transformed object. When animating objects, she prefers to create lifelike animals out of earth, stone, or wood, and can sustain up to four Large creatures at a time (treat as normal animals, except the animal's natural armor increases by +5, its type changes to "construct," and it gains construct immunities). The Arcanotheign must be within 100 feet of the object to use this ability, and can only maintain one type of transformation (alter shape, alter material, or animate objects) at a time. Corporeal Form (Ex) As an immediate action, the Arcanotheign can take physical form, losing her incorporeal special quality and subtype and her deflection bonus to AC, but gaining a Strength score of 20 and a natural armor bonus equal to her normal deflection bonus. She can remain in this form indefinitely or revert to her incorporeal state as a free action (this happens automatically if she is knocked unconscious). This ability allows her to pretend to be a mortal and physically manipulate objects. In this form she looks like a tall woman with pale, gray, or black skin. Eldritch Blast (Su) The Arcanotheign's ranged touch attacks are incorporeal touch attacks that deal 4d6 points of damage and an additional effect chosen by the herald. A saving throw (DC 25) negates the additional effect (the exact type of save depends on what effect the herald chooses); a creature hit by two blasts in the same round suffers an increased effect if it fails both its saves against the eldritch blasts. The possible effects are the following: Bleed (Fortitude): The creature takes 10 points of bleed damage. Increased effect: The creature is disintegrated. Dement (Will): The creature is confused for 1 minute. Increased effect: The creature goes insane (as insanity). Displace (Fortitude): The creature teleports (as dimension door) 5 feet in a random horizontal direction at the end of its turn each round for the next 10 rounds. Increased effect: The creature is banished as if under the effect of a maze spell. Ignite (Reflex): The creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Increased effect: The creature catches on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage every round on the herald's turn for the next 10 rounds. The DC to extinguish the flames is equal to the save DC of the eldritch blast. Paralyze (Will): The creature is paralyzed as if by hold monster. Increased effect: The creature is slowed (as slow) when the paralysis ends or is broken. Energy Channel Aura (Su) The Arcanotheign's aura is charged with energy, whether acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative, or positive. The herald can change the energy type, suppress her aura, or reactivate her aura once per round on her turn as a free action. If the energy is positive or negative, it acts like channeled energy from a cleric, and the herald decides the effect of the channel (positive energy could heal living creatures or harm undead; negative energy could heal undead or harm living creatures). The aura's effect is always 2d6 hit points (Reflex DC 25 negates). A creature that is struck by the herald's incorporeal touch attack takes this damage in addition to the normal touch attack damage, and it gets no saving throw against this extra damage. The herald can use her Selective Channel feat to exclude creatures from the effect of her aura, regardless of the aura's energy type. Resistance to Divine Power (Su) The Arcanotheign has resistance 30 against damage caused by divine power, such as the non-fire damage from a flame strike spell.

Eldritch Blast (Su) The herald chooses an additional effect for its eldritch blasts each round (DC 26 negates). A creature that fails its saves against both blasts in the same round suffers an increased effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Dement (Will): The creature is confused for 1 minute. Increased effect: The creature goes insane (as insanity). Displace (Fortitude): The creature teleports (as dimension door) 5 feet in a random horizontal direction at the end of its turn each round for the next 10 rounds. Increased effect: The creature is affected by maze. Ignite (Reflex): The creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Increased effect: The creature catches on fire. Energy Channel Aura (Su) On its turn, the herald can channel energy (Will DC 26 half) to deal 2d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage to each creature in its aura. A creature struck by its incorporeal touch attack also takes this damage (no saving throw). The save DC is Charisma-based.

This horror can only be seen by each individual onlooker, with even Basileus being unaware of what his viewers see. Those within 30 feet of Basileus must make a DC 25 Will save. Those with 6 or fewer Hit Dice who fail instantly die from fear, while those with 6 or more Hit Dice are panicked and take 6d6 points of damage. Those who save are immune to Basileus's death or panic effects, but still take damage. Those who remain within 30 feet of Basileus, even after making their saves, take 6d6 points of damage every round as long as Basileus continues to take standard actions to maintain the terror. The death and panic aspects of this ability are a mind-affecting fear effect, with even creatures immune to such effects still being affected by the ability's damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. Terror Shape (Su) While making use of his terror ability, Basileus can manifest one to five additional, monstrous limbs. These take on terrible appearances dictated by the terror ability, and deal 2d6+8 damage. When Basileus ceases the use of terror, these additional natural weapons vanish. Veil of Forms (Su) Basileus appears as a powerful and attractive member of the same race as any creature looking upon him. His appearance is always appealing, with subtle illusory alterations that differ from viewer to viewer. Basileus is not aware of the specifics of his appearance to other creatures, though he may alter specifics as per the spell alter self. This is an illusion that is in effect anytime he is not using his terror ability, and grants him a +8 racial modifier on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. Should a creature be able to see past the illusion, Basileus does not gain this racial modifier on opposed checks against that creature.

This gaze is a mind-affecting fear effect that causes its targets to perceive Basileus as the most terrifying thing that it can imagine. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Terror Shape (Su) While using his gaze ability, Basileus manifests one to five monstrous limbs that can make slam attacks.  Veil of Forms (Su) All creatures see Basileus as a powerful and attractive member of their own race. While using this ability, Basileus's gaze ability is suppressed. He can activate or suppress this ability as a free action.

Humans rise as zombies, jann rise as ghuls (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 125), and djinn, efreet, shaitans, and marids rise as great ghuls (see page 51). Any spawn created by a black jinni are under her control.  Dust Vortex (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, a black jinni can cause the obscuring cloud that surrounds her to become a vortex of electrically charged dust. This vortex is 20 feet high and radiates to a range of 30 feet, with the black jinni at the vortex's center. The winds within this area are considered a windstorm (Core Rulebook 439). Creatures within the vortex that would normally be blown away are instead drawn toward the center to a square adjacent to the black jinni. A creature that ends its turn within the dust vortex takes 10d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 23 half). Once the dust vortex is created, it remains stationary, allowing the black jinni to move around in it or even leave it. The vortex remains in place for 1d6 rounds, or until the black jinni dismisses it as a move action. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Obscuring Cloud (Ex) A black jinni is continually surrounded by a cloud of obscuring dust and scouring wind. This cloud gives her a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks while within a sandstorm or other area of blowing dust. In addition, a black jinni has concealment (20% miss chance) while the cloud is in effect. Any strong (or stronger) wind can suppress the obscuring cloud as long as the wind persists.  Shocking Touch (Su) Any creature hit by a black jinni's claw attack or its conductive falchion takes an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage-on a critical hit, this additional electricity damage increases to 2d10 points of damage and the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or the electricity lingers on its body, dealing an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage each round on the start of the victim's turn for 1d6 additional rounds. Immersion in any liquid ends this ongoing damage, as does contact with a metal object of at least Medium or larger size that is in contact with the ground. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stormwalk (Ex) A black jinni is able to move about in any storm of natural or unnatural origin of hurricane velocity or less without suffering any of its effects.  Vulnerability to Recitation (Ex) As cursed genies of evil and chaos, black jinn are strangely susceptible to recitations of certain holy tracts belonging to good or lawful deities or philosophies. These include the spells dictum and holy word, but also forceful recitations of nonmagical holy sermonizing. If a cleric or paladin of a lawful or good deity succeeds at an opposed Knowledge (religion) check against a black jinni's Knowledge (religion) check as a standard action, the black jinni must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly destroyed, leaving behind only a small spot of charred ash. If this save is successful, the black jinni instead takes 5d6 points of damage. Unlike most black jinn, though, Agazuberi is particularly patient and accepting of such recitations-she gains a +4 bonus on her Fortitude saves and Knowledge (religion) checks when reacting to this weakness.																												
Black Magga	15.00	51200	Gargantuan	4	30, touch 6, flat-footed 30	232	19	11	9		26		20 ft., swim 60 ft.	bite +24 (2d8+13/19-20 plus energy drain), 4 tentacles +19 (2d6+6 plus grab)		20 ft.	20 ft.	breath of madness, constrict (2d6+11), energy drain (2 levels, DC 22)	Str 37, Dex 10, Con 31, Int 25, Wis 18, Cha 20	15	+32 (+36 grapple)	42 (can't be tripped)	RotRL-AE-Appendix	Breath of Madness (Su) Black Magga can exhale a cloud of foul-smelling, poisonous breath as a standard action once every minute. This cloud of black smoke fills a 60-foot cone. All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and become confused for 1d6 rounds (a DC 27 Will save halves the Wisdom damage and negates the confusion effect). This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. This breath weapon cannot be used while underwater.  Transdimensional Tentacles (Su) Black Magga's tentacles allow her to see into and infiltrate the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow while she is on the Material Plane. This allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures there, but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack their inhabitants. She can even phase her tentacles in and out of existence, effectively reaching through walls and other solid barriers to attack foes on the other side, provided that area is not warded by a dimensional lock or similar effect. She can grapple foes with her tentacles normally, but cannot pull grappled foes or objects through planes as her tentacles shift between them.  Warp Dimensions (Su) Black Magga's presence distorts the dimensions. Any creature that attempts to utilize a teleportation effect while within 300 feet of Black Magga must succeed at a DC 21 caster level check or the teleport effect fails. If the effect fails, the creature that attempted to create that effect must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Rapid Stinging (Ex) A black scorpion's stinger strikes with astounding speed; it can make one additional attack in a round with its sting as a swift action.																												
Cannon Golem	15.00	51200	Large	7	31, touch 16, flat-footed 24	140	6	13	8				30 ft.	2 slams +29 (2d10+10)	cannon +26/+21 (6d6+7/19-20/x4)	10 ft.	10 ft.	cannon	Str 30, Dex 24, Con -, Int -, Wis 15, Cha 2	20	31	48	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Alloyed (Ex) A cannon golem's slam and cannon attacks count as adamantine, cold iron, and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  Blasting Critical (Ex) When a cannon golem confirms a critical hit with a slam attack, it can make one cannon attack against that target as a free action (as long as the cannon is loaded).  Cannon (Ex) The golem's cannon has a range increment of 100 feet and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a hit with a x4 critical modifier. The cannon's magazine can hold up to 20 cannonballs at a time-reloading a single cannonball into this magazine is a standard action for the golem, while loading a cannonball into the cannon itself to fire it is a swift action; this allows the golem to take two shots per round with the cannon.  Gun Training (Ex) A cannon golem adds its Dex modifier to the damage dealt by its cannon.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A cannon golem is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.  • Any spell with the water descriptor that affects a cannon golem renders its cannon unusable for 1 round (no save).  • A heat metal spell causes the golem's cannon to instantly backfire, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the golem and staggering it for 1 round (no save).																												
Cat Lord	15.00	51200	Medium	11	32, touch 20, flat-footed 25	199	16	20	7	feline passivism, immortality	26		60 ft., climb 30 ft.	2 claws +27 (1d6+7 plus grab), bite +26 (1d8+7)	spit +26 (blindness)	5 ft.	5 ft.	howl, pounce, rake (2 claws +27, 1d6+7)	Str 24, Dex 25, Con 20, Int 19, Wis 17, Cha 20	19	+17 (+21 grapple)	34	Tome of Horrors Complete	Change Shape (Su) The Cat Lord can assume the shape of a human as a standard action. In human form, the Cat Lord cannot use his natural weapons or his howl, pounce, spit, or rake special attacks but can wield weapons and wear armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Cat Lord retains his movement modes (and speeds) in human form. Feline Passivism (Ex) Felines (including dire versions) do not willingly attack the Cat Lord, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the Cat Lord attacks a feline, its protection against that creature ends. Howl (Su) When the Cat Lord howls, all creatures except felines within a 20-foot spread must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the Cat Lord's howl for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based. Immortality (Su) The Cat Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Cat Lord's soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within 9 days, it inhabits another feline on the Material Plane and the Cat Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap his soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Cat Lord, it is thought that one must destroy every feline in existence (so his soul has no creature to inhabit). Keen Senses (Ex): The Cat Lord sees five times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and normal light. Spit (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a ranged attack, the Cat Lord can spit a line of caustic saliva at a single target to a range of 30 feet. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 24 Reflex save or be blinded. Remove blindness or dispel magic (vs. CL 19th) removes the blindness effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Cetaceal	15.00	51200	Medium	8	30, touch 15, flat-footed 25	212	17	16	9		26		10 ft., swim 80 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	shockwave, push (tail slap, 10 ft.)	Str 29, Dex 19, Con 24, Int 14, Wis 18,  Cha 17	17	26	41 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the cetaceal. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals cetaceal's HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in the above stat block.  Shockwave (Su) Once per day, a cetaceal can release a 100-footradius burst of energy.  All creatures in the area take 17d6 damage; half of this damage is cold, and half is electricity (DC 25 Reflex save halves). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stun (Ex) Any creature moved by a cetaceal's push attack must make a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The DC is Constitution-based.																												
Courage Heart	15.00	51200	Medium	10	30, touch 13, flat-footed 27	195	18	18	14				30 ft., fly 30 ft. (average)	#ERROR!	#ERROR!	5 ft.	5 ft.	bloody rose, favored enemy (evil outsiders +6, humans +2, lawful outsiders +8, undead +4)	Str 23, Dex 23, Con 22, Int 22, Wis 21, Cha 24	17	23	39	AP 68	Bloody Rose (Su) At will as a free action, the herald can create a thorny red rose. She may use this rose as a +1 anarchic dart as if she had the Quick Draw feat. The rose loses all its powers 1 round after it leaves the herald's hand.  Darkwood Breastplate The herald's +4 darkwood breastplate has all the normal properties of darkwood but is as hard and strong as steel (similar to wood created with an ironwood spell).  Favored Enemy (Ex) The herald has the favored enemy ability of a 17th-level ranger.  Imbue with Power (Su) The herald can imbue an ally with a portion of her power. This ability functions like imbue with spell ability, except she may transfer uses of the following spell-like abilities as if they were cleric spells: cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, peasant armaments, protection from arrows, shield other, and status. Using this ability reduces the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability until she dismisses the transfer or the recipient expends it (for example, if she imbues a target with cure moderate wounds, thereafter she can only use that spell-like ability twice per day).  Martyr's Blood (Su) By marking an ally with her blood, the herald can transfer part of her fast healing ability to that ally. The herald's fast healing decreases by 1 (minimum 0), and the ally gains fast healing 1 for 1 hour. This ability has no effect if the target already has fast healing.  Rebellious Aura (Su) The herald's aura grants allies within 60 feet the effects of good hope and a paladin's aura of courage. The effects of this ability are included in the herald's stat block.  Tactician (Ex) The herald has the tactician ability of a 17th-level cavalier (4/day, one teamwork feat, all allies within 30 feet, 11 rounds). She may use this ability with any of her teamwork feats (Lookout, Outflank, Swap Places).

Cold (Ex) A crone queen's body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage with its touch. Creatures attacking a crone queen with unarmed strikes or natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.  Frozen Heart (Su) A crone queen's frozen heart contains a tiny portion of Baba Yaga's life, and binds the crone queen to Baba Yaga's will. As a free action, Baba Yaga can command a crone queen as dominate monster (CL 20th). If a crone queen's frozen heart is somehow removed before the creature is destroyed, the crone queen loses its fast healing, spell resistance, and unearthly cold ability.  Hexes (Su) A crone queen can use the following hexes as a 20th-level witch: blight, frostfootISM, hoarfrostUM, ice tombUM, and misfortune. The save DC is 24 to negate or resist and is Intelligence-based.  Ice Staff (Su) As a free action, a crone queen can create a magic staff out of supernaturally hard ice that functions as a +3 frost quarterstaff and allows the crone queen to use her energy drain attack with the staff. The ice staff melts away instantly if it leaves the crone queen's hands.  Unearthly Cold (Su) A crone queen's spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities that deal cold damage are horrendously cold. Half the cold damage caused by these effects comes from an otherworldly power and is not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity to cold-based attacks.																												
Crucidaemon	15.00	51200	Medium	9	29, touch 16, flat-footed 23	212	17	12	13		26		50 ft.	daggers +29/+29/+24/+19/+14 (1d4+11/17-20)		5 ft.	10 ft.	bleed (2d6), chained daggers, trap making	Str 28, Dex 21, Con 24, Int 16, Wis 17, Cha 29	17	26	42	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Chained Daggers (Su) A crucidaemon fights with the two daggers chained to its wrists as if dual wielding daggers with a reach of 10 feet (although it can also attack adjacent foes with no penalty). It takes no penalty on attack or damage rolls while wielding both of these daggers at once. These daggers are considered to be +2 daggers that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. The daggers become nonmagical upon the daemon's death, and cannot be disarmed. A crucidaemon may remanifest a destroyed dagger as a standard action.  Trap Making (Ex) A crucidaemon can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. When it uses its greater glyph of warding spell-like ability to create a spell glyph, it may utilize any 6th-level or lower spell from the cleric or the wizard spell list, even though it otherwise can't cast these spells. The Perception and Disable Device DCs for any traps a crucidaemon creates gain a +2 bonus.

A creature reduced to Dex 0 is turned to crystal (as the stone to flesh spell) permanently if it fails a DC 25 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus from the crysolax's Ability Focus feat.  Scintillating Aura (Ex) As long as there is a light source present within 30 feet of it, the crysolax constantly radiates an aura that duplicates the effects of a rainbow pattern spell (CL 15th). The save is Charisma-based.																												
Devil, Possession Greater	15.00	51200	Medium	8	24, touch 24, flat-footed 15	187	16	19	12		26		30 ft., fly 40 ft. (perfect)	2 claws +19 (1d4+5), bite +19 (1d6+5)		5 ft.	5 ft.	dread, malevolence	Str -, Dex 26, Con 24, Int 17, Wis 20, Cha 20	15	5	15	AP 29	Claws (Su) A gidim's natural attacks inflict real wounds when they rake against physical objects they strike. A gidim's natural weapon damage is modified by its Charisma bonus. Dread (Su) Gidims are adept at using their spell-like abilities to terrifying effect. At will, and while remaining invisible, a gidim can choose to make any of the spell-like abilities noted in its stat block particularly frightening. Any creature that witnesses and is within 10 feet of the effect of one of these spell-like abilities must make a saving throw or be shaken for 1 minute. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Malevolence (Su) Once per day, a gidim on the Material Plane can merge its body with another creature's. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (CL 10th or the devil's HD, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the devil must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 16 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same devil's malevolence for 24 hours. While using this ability, the gidim is not affected by its otherworldly ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. Nourished by Negativity (Su) Gidims seek out volatile mortals to aid them in entering the Material Plane. At the most basic level, negative emotions occur when a creature is dying, raging, or subject to a fear effect. At the GM's discretion, negative emotions might also include non-rules-related effects, such as extreme feelings of anger, betrayal, frustration, hate, or sorrow. Anytime a gidim witnesses a creature affected by negative emotions, it may choose to gain a +1 bonus on its next Will save made to enter the Material Plane, so long as it attempts to enter the plane within 30 feet of that creature and within 24 hours. If within 12 to 24 hours of gaining this bonus the gidim witness the same creature again being affected by negative emotions, it gains an additional +1 bonus on its Will save which stacks with the original and increases the duration of the bonus by an additional 24 hours. Thus, a gidim may gain a stacking +1 bonus to its Will save in this manner once every 12 hours. The devil loses its entire accumulated bonus if it attempts and fails to enter the Material Plane, if 24 hours pass without it witnessing its target creature being affected by negative emotions, or if it takes a bonus from another creature affected by negative emotions. Once on the Material Plane, this bonus applies to a gidim's Will saves made to resist being expelled from the plane. The bonus decreases by 1 every minute until it reaches 0. A gidim that leaves the Material Plane before this bonus reaches 0 retains any remaining bonus. Otherworldly (Ex) Gidims find it difficult to enter the Material Plane. To do so by any means, a lesser possession devil must make a DC 30 Will save, failure meaning it is barred from entry and cannot access the plane again for 12 hours. In addition, after every minute of being on the Material Plane, the devil must make a DC 30 Will save or be expelled, returning to the plane it traveled from. Additionally, as a free action a number of times per day equal to the gidim's Charisma modifier, the devil can empower one of its spell-like abilities to extend out from the Ethereal Plane and affect a target on the Material Plane. Sunlight Weakness (Ex) Gidims' powers are weakened in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell), reducing the DCs of their special abilities by -4. In addition, gidims attempting to enter the Material Plane into an area of sunlight take a -4 penalty on their Will save.																												
Dybbuk	15.00	51200	Medium	15	28, touch 28, flat-footed 17	207	13	17	6	incorporeal, channel resistance +4	26		fly 60 ft.

This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 18th), except that  it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the dybbuk must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 26 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same dybbuk's malevolence for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Pain Touch (Su) With a successful touch attack, a dybbuk causes painful spasms throughout the target's body, dealing 7d6 points of damage. Creatures that are immune to pain take no damage from this touch.  Possess Object (Su) A dybbuk can use its malevolence ability to possess a Large or smaller unattended object, animating it as if using animate objects, except the dybbuk merges with and controls the object as if it were a living creature. The dybbuk cannot speak or use its other special abilities while possessing the object.

Any creature within 10 feet of the Emperor of Scales must make a DC 25 Reflex save or be sprayed by droplets of acidic blood, taking 2d6 points of acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Command Snakes (Ex) As a free action, the Emperor of Scales can command any snake or serpent with the animal or magical beast type, as the dominate animal spell. The target can resist the command with a DC 25 Will save.  Immunity to Vorpal Weapons (Ex) The Emperor of Scales is essentially a giant head with no body. As a result, its head cannot be severed, and vorpal weapons have no additional effect on it.  Maddening Hiss (Su) The Emperor of Scales' numerous snake heads constantly hiss in a maddening cacophony as a free action. Any creature within 100 feet of the Emperor of Scales must make a DC 25 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the Emperor of Scales' maddening hiss for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Bite or swallow-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 2d6 acid and 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves; snakebite-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Any non-evil creature in this area must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or be overcome with awe and unable to attack the empyreal that round.  Evil creatures within the area must make a successful DC 23 Will save or be unable to even look at that empyreal for one day. An affected evil creature functions as if blinded (as the blindness spell) when attacking that empyreal.  On a successful save, a creature is immune to the aura of goodness of that empyreal for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus.  Radiant Blast (Su) Once per day, an empyreal can increase the radiance of its form and release it in a cone-shaped blast to a range of 60 feet that deals 15d6 points of damage and blinds any creature in the area (as the blindness spell) for 3d6 minutes. Affected creatures can make a successful DC 21 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid being blinded. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
End's Voice	15.00	51200	Large	7	31, touch 15, flat-footed 27	225	18	11	19		26		40 ft., fly 40 ft.

Contact Other Plane (Sp) This ability functions as the spell contact other plane, but the herald can only ask questions on the behalf of another creature, the questioner (not the herald) must make the Intelligence check (if any) to avoid losing Intelligence or Charisma, and the loss is permanent rather than temporary.  Destructive Aura (Su) As a swift action, the herald can emit a 30-foot aura of destruction for 15 rounds per day. All attacks made against targets in this aura (including the herald) gain a +7 morale bonus on damage rolls, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.  Maddening Strike (Su) If the herald successfully hits a creature with its flail, as a swift action it may force the opponent to make a DC 25 Will save. If the creature fails its save, it is confused for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Madness (Ex) The herald uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier, and is immune to insanity and confusion effects. Only a miracle or wish can remove its madness. If this occurs, the herald gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma; it automatically reverts to its insane state 1d10 minutes later.  Telepathic Bond (Sp) This ability functions like telepathic bond, except any creature linked to the herald's disturbing thoughts takes 1 point of Wisdom damage every 10 minutes.

A deafened faceless whale is effectively blinded as well. It is invulnerable to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks.  Resonant Song (Su) As a standard action, a faceless whale can focus a 60-foot ray of sonic energy on a single target that deals 8d6 points of damage. This ray deals normal damage to objects, but is still subject to hardness. Alternatively, a faceless whale can blast this resonant energy in a 60- foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Any submerged creature holding its breath must succeed at a second Fortitude saving throw at the same DC or it has its breath knocked out of it and instantly begins drowning.

This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment.  Smoke Form (Sp) As a standard action, a fire yai can turn into a cloud of smoke. This functions like gaseous form, except the cloud has the properties of the smoke cloud from a pyrotechnics spell (Fort DC 26 negates the effects of the smoke cloud). The fire yai can end this ability as a standard action.																												
First Blade	15.00	51200	Large	5	30, touch 10, flat-footed 29	261	20	12	8				30 ft.	2 slams +29 (2d10+16 plus bleed)		10 ft.	10 ft.	blade slam, bleed (1d10), powerful blows	Str 32, Dex 13, Con 28, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 13	18	30	41	AP 35	Blade Slam (Ex) The First Blade's slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage. Its slams count as natural weapons or manufactured weapons (whichever is most beneficial to it) for the purpose of spells that enhance attacks. Its attacks count as adamantine, chaos, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Breathless (Ex) Unlike most outsiders, the First Blade does not need to breathe. Ever Armed (Su) As a swift action, at will, the First Blade can cause a mundane melee weapon of any type or size to appear in its hands. Although it typically battles unarmed, it sometimes makes use of weapons as needed. These weapons come from Gorum's divine realm, and this ability cannot be used to claim a specific weapon. Heavy Fortification (Ex) The First Blade has a 75% chance to treat a critical hit or sneak attack as a normal attack, as if it were wearing heavy fortification armor. Immunity to Magic (Ex) The First Blade is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. The First Blade can lower this resistance for 1 round as a standard action (similar to a creature with spell resistance lowering its spell resistance) to allow other creatures to cast spells on it; it can use its spell-like abilities on itself without difficulty. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the First Blade (as the slow spell) for 1 round, with no saving throw. • A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the First Blade and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the First Blade to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The First Blade gets no saving throw against fire effects. • The First Blade is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell. Ironsense (Ex) The First Blade automatically detects iron objects (including steel) within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Lord of Battle (Ex) The First Blade is treated as an 18th-level barbarian and fighter for any game rule (such as a feat prerequisite) that requires levels in barbarian or fighter. It is proficient in all weapons. Powerful Blows (Ex) The First Blade inflicts one and a half times its Strength modifier and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks. Rage Aura (Su) Willing creatures within 100 feet of the First Blade gain the effects of a rage spell automatically, whether they are allies or enemies of the Herald. Those who choose not to be affected are immune to the aura until they leave the area and return (at which point they may again accept or refuse the aura's effect). Swarm Form (Su) The First Blade can shift between its manlike body and a floating swarm of Diminutive and Tiny sharp metal fragments as a standard action. In swarm form it has the swarm subtype; it cannot use its slam attacks but instead can make a swarm attack (4d6 and distraction). Though its individual components may float up to 10 feet above the ground as they move, the Blade's swarm form cannot fly. The First Blade remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the First Blade revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.																												
Fisherman	15.00	51200	Large	2	21, touch 11, flat-footed 19	202	13	11	16		26		40 ft., swim 30 ft.	#ERROR!	net +16 (entangle)	10 ft.	10 ft.		Str 28, Dex 15, Con 26, Int 15, Wis 21, Cha 20	15	25	37	Tome of Horrors 4	Create Soul Cage (Su) Using debris that floats to the bottom of the ocean, a fisherman can construct a soul cage. The soul cage is a magical construction that, through its crafting, has been endowed with a trap the soul spell. The spell requires no material components other than the debris from which it is created. The magic of the soul cage only functions for fishermen and the souls remain trapped for as long as the fisherman wishes and remains on the Material Plane. Usually, only upon the death of the fisherman may the trapped souls be released. A soul cage can hold up to six souls at any given time.  Deathwatch (Sp) A fisherman makes constant use of the spell deathwatch, as cast by a 15th level cleric. The range of a fisherman's deathwatch is 1 mile per hit die, allowing it to sense the life state of any creature within its territory. This ability can be negated, but the fisherman can reactivate it the next round as a free action.  Exotic Weapons (Ex) A fisherman is proficient in the use of the boat hook and gaff hook.  Gambling (Ex) Fishermen are fond of games and gambling and should one be offered a fair chance of odds, he may find a wager impossible to resist. In this way, it may be possible to bargain for the release of the soul of a companion or loved one. Although evil, fishermen are bound by a personal code and honor the terms of a wager if they lose.  Spells Fishermen cast divine spells as 9th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.  Weather Sense (Su) A fisherman always knows the condition of the weather within a 30 mile radius, even if he is currently underwater.																												
Gare Linnorm	15.00	51200	Gargantuan	9	30, touch 30, flat-footed 25	229	17	15	14	freedom of movement	26		40 ft., swim 100 ft.	bite +26 (2d8+13/19-20 plus poison), 2 claws +26 (2d6+13), tail slap +21 (2d8+6 plus grab)		20 ft.	20 ft.	breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 17d8 fire damage, Reflex DC 25 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), constrict (tail, 2d8+19), death curse, poison	Str 36, Dex 20, Con 25, Int 5, Wis 18, Cha 21	17	+34 (+38 grapple)	68 (can't be tripped)	AP 50	Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a gare linnorm can breathe a 60-foot cone of scalding steam, dealing 17d8 points of fire damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 25 halves). This steam then hangs in the air for 1 round after the linnorm creates it. Creatures in the area of effect or that enter the area take an additional 6d6 points of fire damage the second round (Reflex DC 25 negates). In addition, the cloud of steam acts as the spell solid fog, with a caster level equal to the linnorm's HD. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Death Curse (Su) When a creature slays a gare linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse of the drowning gasp.  Curse of the Drowning Gasp: save Will DC 22; effect anytime the creature imbibes a liquid of any kind, its lungs fill with water and it begins to drown. Treat this as the spell suffocation* (DC 19 Fort save to resist), with a caster level equal to the linnorm's Hit Dice. The save DC for the curse is Charisma-based. * See page 248 of the Advanced Player's Guide.  Freedom of Movement (Ex) A gare linnorm is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.  Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 3d6 fire damage and 1d6 Dex drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  True Seeing (Ex) A gare linnorm has true seeing, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.																												
Gorynych	15.00	51200	Huge	2	28, touch 10, flat-footed 26	212	16	14	15		26		30 ft., fly 100 ft. (poor), swim 50 ft.	3 bites +24 (2d8+8), 2 claws +23 (1d8+8)		15 ft.	10 ft. (20 ft. with bite)	breath weapon (40-ft. cone, 5d6 fire, Reflex DC 24 for half, usable every 1d4 rounds)	Str 27, Dex 15, Con 22, Int 12, Wis 17, Cha 18	17	27	39	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Breath Weapon (Su) Each of a gorynych's heads has its own separate breath weapon. When a gorynych uses its breath weapon, it can breathe with one, two, or all three heads. If the areas of two or more breath weapons overlap, a creature caught in that overlapping area takes a -2 penalty on its Reflex save (or -4 if three breath weapons overlap). Damage done by overlapping breath weapons stacks and is considered to be a single source of fire damage for the purpose of tracking fire resistance.  Regardless of how many heads breathe fire, the gorynych can only use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds.  Multi-Headed (Ex) All three of a gorynych's heads can act independently of each other. When it makes a full attack, each head can either bite or use its breath weapon, in any combination (two bites and one breath, three breaths and no bites, and so on).																												
Grand Defender	15.00	51200	Huge	3	32, touch 7, flat-footed 32	157	6	5	8				30 ft.	warhammer +27/+22/+17/+12 (3d6+11/x3)		15 ft.	15 ft.	breath weapon, hammer storm	Str 32, Dex 9, Con -, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 13	18	31	40	AP 62	Ablative Adaptation (Su) As a standard action, the Grand Defender can cast off its outer layer of metal, revealing a slightly smaller version of itself underneath. This new form may be made of cold iron, mithral, or iron, and its appearance may change with each use of the ability, altering its apparent genders, hair style, and so on. In its cold iron form, the Grand Defender's DR changes to DR 15/cold iron and its attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. In its mithral form, its DR changes to DR 15/silver and its attacks count as silver. In its iron form, its abilities revert to normal. If the herald is brought to 0 hit points, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds its outer layer and reanimates at half its normal hit points. Regardless of how often it uses this ability, the herald never changes size categories, as if it slowly grows to its normal size between transformations. Once shed, the outer layer decays into worthless powder 1d4 minutes after the transformation, though before this occurs it can spend 1 full round consuming the discarded metal to recharge its hammer storm ability.  Breath Weapon (Su) As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, an iron golem can exhale a 10-foot cube of poisonous gas that persists for 1 round. Any creature within the area when it is exhaled (as well as any creature that passes through the cloud during the remainder of that round) is exposed to the cloud's poisonous effects. This poison is magically created each time the golem uses this power. Breath weapon-inhaled; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Defender's Shield (Ex) The Grand Defender's shield is a +3 heavy steel shield, though it becomes nonmagical if the herald is destroyed or is no longer holding or wearing it.  Dwarf Traits (Ex) The Grand Defender has the following dwarven racial traits: defensive training, hardy, hatred, stability, stonecunning, and weapon familiarity.  Hammer Storm (Ex) Once per day as a full-round action, the Grand Defender can expel a volley of warhammers from its mouth in a 30-foot cone that deals 15d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 19 half). If the herald is in its cold iron or mithral form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver. The Grand Defender can exclude any number of squares in the cone's area, preventing the hammers from striking those squares. The attack also counts as an awesome blow, though the Defender makes a single combat maneuver check, applying that result to the CMD of all creatures in the area, and affected creatures can only be knocked directly away from the Defender. The hammer storm actually creates 24 physical warhammers that persist after the instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures (though they are normal warhammers, not masterwork, cold iron, or mithral). The Grand Defender can spend 1 minute eating 24 warhammers (or an equivalent amount of metal) to recharge this ability.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) The Grand Defender is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.  • A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the Grand Defender (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  • A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the Grand Defender and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the herald to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The Defender gets no saving throw against fire effects.  • The Grand Defender is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.

Gravedragger must be  adjacent to the grave he intends to drag his target into. Treat this as a special drag combat maneuver. The target takes 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half) and is buried alive (see Cave-Ins and Collapses on page 415 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Long Arm of the Reaper (Ex) Gravedragger can throw his heavy pick up to 100 feet away as a ranged attack with no range increment. The weapon automatically returns just before the herald's next turn, as if it had the returning weapon quality.  Unearthly Luck (Su) Gravedragger adds his Charisma bonus as a luck bonus on all his saving throws and to his Armor Class.  Unluck Aura (Su) Gravedragger radiates an aura of unluck to a radius of 30 feet. Any creature in this area must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results. This is a mind-affecting effect that doesn't work on worshipers of Zyphus. Any creature that gains any sort of luck bonus (such as that granted by a luckstone or divine favor) is immune to Gravedragger's unluck aura.

His allies within 20 feet gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while he's conscious, not if he's unconscious or dead.  Improved Rock Catching (Ex) Great Elder Iuu gains a +4 racial bonus on his Reflex save when attempting to catch a thrown rock with rock catching. This ability otherwise works as the rock catching ability.  Stone Giant Blood (Ex) Great Elder Iuu counts as a stone giant for any effect related to race.  Summon Boulders (Su) Great Elder Iuu can summon three adamantine throwing rocks as a swift action. If thrown, the rocks disappear at the end of his turn. Any rocks leaving his grasp otherwise disappear immediately.

Tree Meld (Su) A hamadryad can meld with any tree (similar to meld into stone) and can remain melded with a tree as long as she wishes.  Woodcraft (Ex) A hamadryad has a +8 racial bonus on Craft checks involving wood, and is always treated as if she had masterwork artisan's woodworking tools when attempting such checks.

Str 25, Dex 21, Con 22, Int 22, Wis 24, Cha 23	18	26	41	AP 26	Aura of Courage (Su) The Hand of the Inheritor radiates an aura of courage identical to that of an 18th-level paladin. Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel's HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel's statistics block. Truespeech (Su) The Hand of the Inheritor can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level equal to angel's Hit Dice).

Wherever a rock thrown by a Hell gigas lands, it explodes in a 30-foot burst of flame that deals 1d6 points of fire damage for every three Hit Dice the gigas possesses (Reflex DC 27 for half ). This is in addition to any damage caused by the thrown rock. The save DC is Constitution-based. Planar Empowerment (Su) While on the plane of Hell, a Hell gigas gains access to earthquake (DC 25), firestorm (DC 25), and unholy aura as spell-like abilities, each usable once per day. If the gigas ventures onto another plane, it cannot make use of theseabilities (though its other spell-like abilities remain available).

The first is a trilling croak like that of a frog. All opponents with 30 feet hearing this trilling must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d6+4 rounds. Opponents within 10 feet must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.  Alternately, a herald can focus its bellow attack against a single opponent within 100 feet. The opponent takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Bloated (Ex) Because of its bloated, heavy body, a herald of Tsathogga that attacks with more than 5 tentacles in one round cannot move that round.  Regeneration (Ex) A herald of Tsathogga takes normal damage from fire and good-aligned weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.

The target loses the majority of memories relating to life and identity, and the hyakume can control the creature as if it were subject to a charm monster spell until those memories are regained (Will DC 28 negates). The hyakume absorbs the memories and can store and use them. It can store the memories of a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence bonus (typically 4) at one time. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Eye Probe (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a hyakume can detach up to six of its eyes and send them on missions. An eyeball has AC 22, hp 5, and a fly speed of 60 ft. with perfect maneuverability. A hyakume can see through all of its eye probes, and can make drain memory attacks with them. If a hyakume's eyeball is destroyed, the hyakume takes 5 points of damage. An eye probe can't stray farther than 1 mile from a hyakume or the eye is destroyed (dealing 5 points of damage).  Monk Abilities The hyakume's Stunning Fist feat and slam attacks function as though it were a 15th-level monk. It can also use the quivering palm class feature once per day (Fortitude DC 25). The save DC is Wisdom-based.  Transfer Memories (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can touch a willing creature with either its hand or one of its eye probes to transfer memories it has stored to the creature touched.

(20 ft. with bite)	deadly bite, shriek, swallow whole (3d6+19 bludgeoning plus 2d6 acid damage, AC 20, 23 hp)	Str 37, Dex 15, Con 22, Int 2, Wis 16, Cha 13	20	+35 (+39 grapple)	48	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Adaptive Defense (Su) When first encountered, a jubjub bird has no energy resistance. When damaged by an attack that causes cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, it gains resistance 30 to that energy type until the end of its next turn. If an attack causes more than one type of energy damage, the jubjub bird gains resistance 30 to all the types of energy damage dealt.  Deadly Bite (Ex) A jubjub bird applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its bite attack. A successful critical hit decapitates and instantly slays a Large or smaller victim (DC 33 Fortitude negates decapitation; creatures without a head are immune to this effect) and deals triple normal damage regardless of the decapitation result.  The save DC is Strength-based.  Planar Acclimation (Ex) A jubjub bird is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.  Shriek (Ex) Once every 1d6 rounds as a standard action, a jubjub bird can voice a piercing screech. All creatures (other than jubjub birds) within a 60-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Juggernaut Robot	15.00	51200	Gargantuan	0	26, touch 6, flat-footed 26	245	6	6	7	hardness 10		vulnerable to critical hits and electricity	50 ft.	2 slams +29 (2d6+13/19-20 plus 1d6 electricity)	2 integrated heavy laser rifles +16 touch (4d10 fire)	20 ft.	20 ft.	atomizer, charge fist, combined arms, electromagnetic pulse, vicious trample (6d6+19, DC 33)	Str 36, Dex 11, Con -, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 1	20	+37 (+41 bull rush, +39 sunder)	47 (49 vs. bull rush, 49 vs. sunder)	AP 89	Atomizer (Ex) As a full-round action once every 3 rounds, a juggernaut robot can fire a ray from its eye as a ranged touch attack. On a hit, the ray deals 15d6 points of damage. When used against an object, the atomizer disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. A creature or object that succeeds at a DC 21 Fortitude save instead takes only 5d6 points of damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this attack is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  Charge Fist (Ex) A juggernaut robot can charge its oversized fists with electricity as a free action, causing its slam attacks to deal 1d6 points of electricity damage. On a critical hit, a charged strike explodes with electric energy, dealing an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage. This electricity doesn't harm the juggernaut.  Combined Arms (Ex) When taking a full-attack action, a juggernaut robot can attack with its melee and ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.  Electromagnetic Pulse (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a juggernaut robot can unleash an electromagnetic pulse in a 20- foot radius that bypasses any active force fields (or similar effects) and deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to any robots or creatures with cybernetic implants. This effect doesn't harm the juggernaut robot itself or other living creatures. Creatures affected by this attack that succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save take only half the normal amount of damage. Any technological item within this radius is drained of 1d6 charges unless the item succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.  Force Field (Ex) A juggernaut robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants it 75 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a juggernaut with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the juggernaut is immune to critical hits. A juggernaut's force field has fast healing 10, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  Integrated Heavy Lasers (Ex) A juggernaut robot has a heavy laser rifle built into each of its arms. Each weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 4d10 points of fire damage. Each can fire once per round in a burst of shots that attacks all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll against each creature in the line, and each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage can't be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately.  Targeting Array (Ex) Juggernaut robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible. In addition, because of their complex array of sensors, juggernauts suffer no miss chance if a target has concealment, and reduce the miss chance from total concealment to 20%.  Vicious Trample (Ex) A juggernaut robot's massive steel feet deal 6d6+19 points of damage on a successful trample attack.

Keelhaul (Ex) If the herald hits a creature with two or more incorporeal touch attacks in 1 round, it can perform a reposition combat maneuver as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the herald moves the target into or through a square adjacent to it (including over or under itself ), the target takes 1d6 points of slashing or bludgeoning damage (herald's choice) for every 5 feet of this movement. If this movement results in the target being underwater, the target must hold its breath or begin to drown. Alternatively, if the herald can reposition the target to the center of its space, it can attempt to force the target into its cargo hold and snap the doors shut, holding the target in place as the swallow whole ability. The herald can hold up to four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature with this ability.  Rush (Ex) Once per minute for 1 round, the herald can move at a swim speed of 150 feet, even downward.  Telekinesis (Su) The herald makes ranged attacks by telekinetically hurling objects or creatures on its deck as weapons. This ability functions as the spell telekinesis (CL 18th). It can use the ability on objects or creatures of up to 375 pounds, dealing 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds of the hurled object or creature. If the herald attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC 18). The save DC is Charisma-based.

When attempting to damage an item, a kongamato's beak attack does double damage and is treated as if it were adamantine for the purposes of overcoming the object's hardness.  Wailing Dive (Su) When a kongamato makes a charge while flying or uses its Flyby Attack feat, the creature's body becomes infused with energy, causing its bite to deal an extra +1d6 points of sonic damage on that attack.

The loss of her connection to the goddess severely weakens the herald, and she gains 1 negative level per day, up to a maximum of 16 negative levels. These negative levels cannot be suppressed or removed in any way (including restoration spells), except by using her feed ability. If Lissala returns and the herald regains her connection to her master, she permanently loses this weakness and its associated negative levels.  Feed (Su) Once per day, the herald can devour an outsider's corpse as a full-round action. For each Hit Die of the devoured outsider, the herald automatically removes 1 negative level gained from her divine separation ability. The consumed outsider must have at least 8 Hit Dice.  Intelligence Drain (Su) The herald drains 1d4 points of Intelligence each time she hits with her slam attack. (The herald does not heal any damage when she uses her Intelligence drain.)  Power Surge (Su) Three times per day as a swift action, the herald can increase the DC of her next spell-like ability (if it is cast that round) by +2.  Spell-Like Crafting (Su) The herald may use any of her spell-like abilities when crafting magic items as if they were actual spells.

This change lasts until it changes size again or is killed.  Create Soldiers (Ex) Once per day, Latten Mechanism can create up to four clockwork soldiers (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 57). These soldiers serve it for 1 hour, after which they break down into their component parts.  Double Damage Against Objects (Ex) If Latten Mechanism makes a full attack against an object or structure, it deals double damage.  Integrated Masterwork Tools (Ex) Latten Mechanism can extend additional limbs from its body that end in masterwork tools suitable for any Craft skill it has ranks in.  Lyre of Building (Su) Latten Mechanism has all of the abilities of a lyre of building (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 522), with the same limitations as that item.  Master of Crafting (Ex) Latten Mechanism can spend 10 minutes reconfiguring itself to allocate its 18 ranks in the Craft skill to any specific Craft skills in any combination. For example, it can allocate 9 ranks in Craft (armor) and 9 ranks in Craft (clockwork). All Craft skills are class skills for Latten Mechanism.

A manitou can exclude a number of creatures equal to its Charisma modifier (typically 7) from the aura's effect, and can cease or resume the aura as a free action. Spirit Stampede (Su) Every 1d4 rounds, a manitou can call upon animal spirits to attack, affecting a 60-foot cone and dealing 10d6 points of force damage (Reflex DC 26 half). Using this ability temporarily weakens the manitou's connection with the natural world, halting its positive energy aura until the stampede is ready to be used again.  Token of Fortune (Su) A manitou can imbue an small object, such as a stone or necklace, with its blessing. The object's bearer and any allies within 10 feet gain a +2 luck bonus on saving throws. The manitou can use scrying on the token at will. The manitou can teleport to it (without error) once per day as a swift action. These abilities are lost if the token leaves the manitou's territory. A manitou may only have one token active at a time.

Any dying creature within range of this aura does not receive a Constitution check to stabilize, but can still be healed as normal-though it may be affected by bleed in subsequent rounds if it is not restored to 0 or more hit points. Any creatures with fast healing or regeneration must also succeed at a DC 23 Will save every round or that ability does not function for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

On each successful attack, the herald gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based. Create Spawn (Su) Any creature slain by the Maw (including those that die from any of its special attacks or disease) rises 1 round later as a bloody skeleton loyal to the herald. Deathless (Su): The Maw is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but it returns to unlife 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing to resume healing it thereafter. The Maw can be permanently destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its remains are sprinkled with 20 vials of holy water. Desecrate (Sp) The bonuses from the Maw's constant desecrate spell-like ability (always centered on it) are calculated into the stats above. Devour Soul (Su) By using its swallow whole ability, the herald can deal 12d6+18 points of damage to a swallowed creature as if using a slay living spell. A DC 21 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. A swallowed creature must make this save every round on the herald's turn. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the herald's skull (the creature's body is regurgitated immediately as a mangled wreck of shattered bone and chewed meat). The creature cannot be brought back to life until the herald's destruction (or a spell deflection-see below) releases its soul. The Maw can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides the Maw with fast healing 20, lasting 1 round for every Hit Die of the devoured soul. The trapped soul gains one permanent negative level for every round it spends within the Maw-these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle or wish spell. The save DC is Charisma-based. Spell Deflection (Su) If any of the following spells is cast at the Maw and overcomes its spell resistance, it instead affects the devoured soul: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected-success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal. Swallow Whole (Ex) If a creature cuts its way out of the Maw after being swallowed, the Maw can use swallow whole once its fast healing repairs the damage caused by its prey cutting itself free. True Herald Despite its type and Hit Dice, Mother's Maw is the herald of Urgathoa. Despite its type and Hit Dice, it can be conjured using the spell greater planar binding. Vomit Swarm (Su) Once per round as a free action, the Maw can vomit forth a swarm of maggots (use the statistics for army ants on page 16 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) into a square adjacent to it, after which the swarm moves in a direction of the Maw's choosing. These swarms persist for 10 rounds.

It can be permanently destroyed by positive energy, being reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if 20 vials of holy water are sprinkled on its remains. Devour Soul (Su) A creature swallowed by the herald must save every round against slay living (DC 25, caster level 15th). The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the herald's skull, and the mangled corpse is immediately regurgitated. The creature cannot be brought back to life until the herald's destruction (or a spell deflection-see below) releases its soul. The Maw can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides the Maw with fast healing 20, lasting 1 round for every Hit Die of the devoured soul. The trapped soul gains 1 permanent negative level for every round it spends within the Maw-these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but don't stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may be restored to life only by a miracle or wish spell. The save DC is Charisma-based. Disease (Su) Mother's Maw bite attack carries mummy rot (Fortitude DC 25). Spell Deflection (Su) If any of the following spells is cast at the Maw and overcomes its spell resistance, it instead affects the devoured soul: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster must attempt a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected- success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal. Mother's Maw can only benefit from this ability while it has a soul devoured.

If the cyclops uses its gore attack for this ability, it can hurl the target up to 60 feet upward instead of sideways.  Earthquake (Su) A mythic great cyclops can punch the ground and expend two uses of mythic power to cause an earthquake (as the spell). Add the cyclops's rank to the save DCs for the earthquake's effects. Other mythic great cyclopes are not affected by the earthquake.  Flash of Brutality (Su) Once per day as a swift action, a great cyclops can gain a burst of savage inspiration.

(perfect)	incorporeal touch +21 (3d8 plus 1d6 Con drain)		5 ft.	5 ft.	bound spirits	Str -, Dex 26, Con -, Int 21, Wis 25, Cha 25	13	21	39	Tomb Of The Iron Medusa	Bound Spirits (Su) A nemhain is surrounded by a whirling cloud of spirits bound to her-often, these are the spirits of close relatives or friends she had in life. As a swift action, she can direct these bound spirits to strike at any creature within 30 feet as a +21 ranged touch attack. These spirits may be used to cause damage as if she had touched the target with her incorporeal touch, or they can be used to deliver a harm or slay living effect-if used to deliver one of these spell-like abilities as a swift action, that use counts against the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability. The nemhain can also send these spirits up to 1 mile away to act as scouts at a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect)-she can observe and listen through them, but as long as they do not share her space, she cannot use them to deliver ranged touch attacks. These spirits are impervious to almost all attacks and magic, save the following: protection from evil prevents bound spirits from harming persons so protected; dispel evil, raise dead, or resurrection causes the spirits to vanish and be useless to the nemhain for 1 hour; true resurrection makes them useless for 24 hours.  Rejuvenation (Su) All nemhains are tied to a ritual object used in their creation. This object is typically a Large statue, pillar, or monolith. Until this object is destroyed, a destroyed nemhain automatically rejuvenates back to full health 1d4 days after it is destroyed.

A successful DC 25 Will save negates the effect. This effect can only harm creatures with Intelligence scores. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Psychic Crush (Su) As a standard action up to three times a day, a neothelid can attempt to crush the mind of a single creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 25 Will save or collapse, becoming unconscious and dying at -1 hit points. If the target succeeds on the save, it takes 6d6 points of damage and is sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Trace Teleport (Ex) A neothelid telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates of the destination, of all creatures that teleport within 60 feet of it, gaining an awareness of the location equivalent to "seen casually." This knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This power does not grant any environmental information about the conditions of the destination.

It can use this ability in the air to entangle flying creatures without requiring the use of anchor points to hold the web in place. Dream Dust (Su) As a full-round action, the Night Monarch can flutter its wings to create a 30-foot burst of dust centered on itself. This dust affects creatures as deep slumber, but with no Hit Die limit (Will DC 25 negates). This ability is usable once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Poison Flesh (Ex) Any creature that bites the Night Monarch is exposed to black lotus extract poison (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558). Eating the Night Monarch's flesh gives the attacker a -4 penalty on the poison's saving throw.

Slow Aura (Su) An old or older copper dragon is surrounded by an aura of slowness. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon must make a Will save or be affected as per slow for 1 round. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. For great wyrm copper dragons, those opponents that fail their saves are slowed for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. A copper dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.  Slow Breath (Su) Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.  Trap Master (Ex) A juvenile or older copper dragon receives a +1 bonus per age category on Craft (traps) and Perception checks made to locate a trap. Upon becoming a mature adult, he can also use Disable Device to disarm magic traps as if he had the rogue's Trapfinding class feature.

Drench (Ex) The herald's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Huge size or smaller. The herald can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level 19th). Energy Arc (Ex) The herald can throw blasts of cold or electricity to damage foes. These blasts have a maximum range of 100 feet. Storm Spirit (Su) Once per day, the herald can merge with an unattended object of Large, Huge, or Gargantuan size, giving it life as an animated object (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14). The herald flows into the animated object, and cannot itself be harmed while in this form, though the animated object can be damaged as normal. The herald controls the object and may speak through it and use any of its own spell-like abilities in addition to those of the animated object, but may not use any of its own extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The herald may animate an object for an indefinite period, and may leave whenever it chooses, though it may not animate another object for 24 hours after leaving. The herald can be driven out of an object by dismissal or by taking 10 or more points of damage from a channel energy effect utilizing the Elemental Channel feat to damage air or water elementals. If driven out, the herald appears in an adjacent space to the now-inert object and is stunned for 1d4 rounds. Vortex (Su) The herald can create a whirlpool at will as a standard action. This ability functions identically to its whirlwind special attack, but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water. Water Mastery (Ex) The herald gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (Unlike a water elemental, the herald does not have a penalty if it or its opponent is touching the ground.)

Vortex (Su) The herald can create a whirlpool at will as a standard action. This ability functions identically to its whirlwind special attack, but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water.

The bloodstorm forms a whirlwind of blood in a column 25 feet in diameter and 40 feet high. The effect has a duration of 12 rounds, requiring those within to make a DC 20 Reflex save to avoid being blinded while they remain within the whirlwind and for 2d6 rounds after leaving it and a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming panicked if less than 8 HD or frightened if 8 HD or above for the duration of the effect. Furthermore, creatures fighting within the bloodstorm or ranged attacks passing through it take -4 penalty on attack rolls Finally, the blood is slightly acidic and deals 1d4 points of acid damage per round. The petrified horror is immune to the effects of the bloodstorm, including the attack penalties, and the whirlwind remains centered on the petrified horror even if it moves. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Full details of the bloodstorm spell can be found in Relics & Rituals by Sword & Sorcery Studios.

Str 27, Dex 25, Con 20, Int 23, Wis 22, Cha 22	20	32	50	PFRPG Bestiary	Self-Resurrection (Su) A slain phoenix remains dead for only 1d4 rounds unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate. Otherwise, a fully healed phoenix emerges from the remains 1d4 rounds after death, as if brought back to life via resurrection. The phoenix gains 1 permanent negative level when this occurs, although most use greater restoration to remove this negative level as soon as possible. A phoenix can self-resurrect only once per year. If a phoenix dies a second time before that year passes, its death is permanent. A phoenix that dies within the area of a desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until the desecrate effect ends, at which point the phoenix immediately resurrects. A phoenix brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a result.  Shroud of Flame (Su) A phoenix can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As long as its feathers are burning, it inflicts an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with each natural attack, and any creature within reach (20 feet for most phoenixes) must make a DC 25 Reflex save each round to avoid taking 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the phoenix with natural or non-reach melee weapons takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Harvester of Sorrow (Su) A popobala heals as a result of the suffering of others. It gains fast healing 10 if at least one creature within 15 feet has one or more of the following conditions: confused, cowering, dying, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned.  Horrid Haunting (Su) A popobala may use ghost sound or ventriloquism as a free action whenever it manipulates a creature or object with animate objects, dominate person, or telekinesis. The ghost sound or ventriloquism originates from the controlled object or creature.  Popobala Fever (Su) A creature wounded by a popobala's talons becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes unless it makes a DC 25 Fortitude save. A creature already sickened by the fever becomes nauseated for 1d6 rounds. One already nauseated by the fever is helpless for 1d6 rounds. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Proscriber	15.00	51200	Medium	7	25, touch 11, flat-footed 24	157	14	11	14		26		40 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	condemn	Str 25, Dex 17, Con 20, Int 21, Wis 20, Cha 18	15	22	35	Tome of Horrors Complete	Condemn (Su) Once per day, as a melee touch attack, a proscriber can sever the connection between a divine caster and his or her deity. The target can attempt a DC 22 Will save (to negate the effects. If the save fails, the divine caster loses the ability to cast divine spells, turn or rebuke undead, smite good or evil, and loses the use of other divine-based spell, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Even if the save succeeds, the divine caster touched takes 10d6 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Additionally, one that fails its save resists all beneficial divine spells (such as heal, or any cure spell) and effects cast on him or her. A creature attempting to cast a beneficial divine spell on a condemned creature must make a successful DC 20 caster level check or the spell has no effect on the condemned creature. The effects of this ability are permanent but can be removed by the casting of a remove curse spell followed by an atonement spell. The one casting the remove curse and atonement spells must be a divine caster who worships the same god as the condemned and who is of a class level equal to or higher than the condemned.																												
Riftcreeper	15.00	51200	Gargantuan	12	30, touch 14, flat-footed 22	217	15	13	8	adaptive defenses			30 ft., climb 30 ft., swim 20 ft.	2 slams +22 (4d6+14 plus 2d4 acid and grab)	6 strands +15 touch (2d4 acid and attach)	20 ft.	20 ft.	constrict (slam, 4d6+14 plus 2d6 acid), pull (strand, 20 feet)	Str 39, Dex 27, Con 30, Int 7, Wis 16, Cha 10	11	+29 (+31 bull rush, +33 grapple)	47 (49 vs. bull rush, can't be tripped)	The Worldwound	Adaptive Defenses (Su) After being damaged by any magical effect that deals cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, a riftcreeper's body instantly adapts to become immune to that form of energy. A riftcreeper can only adapt to one of those four types of energy at a time-if it adapts to a new energy type, it loses its immunity to the previous type. Otherwise, the immunity lasts for 1 hour.  Gelatinous Surge (Ex) Once per minute as a standard action, a riftcreeper can extrude a protoplasmic tendril of ooze to attach to any vertical surface within 120 feet. It can then transfer its entire bulk along that tendril as part of that move action to change its location to the surface to which it's now attached. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Any creatures along its line of travel are subjected to a bull rush attempt.  Strands (Ex) A riftcreeper can extend up to six thin, sticky strands from its body at a time as a standard action, launching them to a maximum range of 120 feet. These attacks resolve as ranged touch attacks. On a hit, a strand deals 2d4 points of acid damage to its target and attaches to the creature. These strands are quite strong, but any amount of slashing damage severs them (a strand has AC 25). As long as a strand remains attached to a target, that creature takes an additional 2d4 points of acid damage at the start of its turn. A riftcreeper can automatically absorb the strands into its body if it uses its gelatinous surge ability (and, in doing so, it releases any attached creatures).																												
Sea Bonze	15.00	51200	Gargantuan	4	30, touch 6, flat-footed 30	231	13	9	19				40 ft., swim 80 ft.	2 slams +22 (4d10+10)		20 ft.	20 ft.	capsize, dooming gaze (60 ft., DC 27)	Str 30, Dex 11, Con -, Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 23	16	30	40 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Dooming Gaze (Su) Paralyzed with fear for 1 round, 60 feet, Will DC 27 negates. A creature that is already paralyzed by this gaze attack and fails a saving throw to resist being paralyzed for 1 more round gains 1 negative level (Fortitude DC 27 to remove after 24 hours). The paralysis effect of this gaze is a mind-affecting fear effect, but the negative level is not. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Seraptis	15.00	51200	Medium	10	30, touch 20, flat-footed 24	217	18	11	13	bloodless	26		50 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	compelling domination, ravenous embrace	Str 22, Dex 23, Con 28, Int 16, Wis 19, Cha 21	15	+21 (+25 grapple)	41	Book of the Damned V2	Bloodless (Ex) A seraptis's body is not completely bloodless, but what blood its body does contain is typically blood taken from its previous victims-the blood that flows through the demon's atrophied veins does nothing to give it life. Its wounds do not bleed, and it is immune to bleed effects and to attacks that utilize blood drain to function.  Sneak attacks, critical hits, and similar attacks function normally on a seraptis, although if such effects would normally cause bleed damage, those additional effects do not work.  Compelling Domination (Su) When a seraptis uses dominate person (as a spell or spell-like ability), its victims do not actively resist the control and do not gain a new saving throw when ordered to take actions against their nature unless those actions are obviously self-destructive, in which case the victim does get a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to escape the effects of the domination.  Gaze of Despair (Su) A seraptis's gaze fills the minds of those within 30 feet with overwhelming and soul-crushing despair. Anyone who fails a DC 22 Will save upon being exposed to a seraptis's gaze immediately takes 1d6 points of Charisma drain and is staggered for 1d6 rounds. If the Charisma drain would normally reduce a creature's Charisma to 0, that creature instead succumbs to overwhelming suicidal urges and attempts to end its life by the most convenient method at hand, subject to GM discretion. (In most cases, this effect causes a creature to make a coup de grace attempt on itself, but if a more dramatic method of self-destruction is available, the creature takes that action.) Once a creature reaches this suicidal state of despair, it remains in that state until its Charisma score is restored to its normal maximum-if methods of restoring lost Charisma are not available, the suicidal victim must be restrained at all times to prevent attempts to kill itself. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Grab (Ex) A seraptis gains a cumulative +4 bonus on grapple attempts for each successive claw attack that hits in a single round, provided the claw attacks all hit the same target. If she grabs a foe, she can use her ravenous embrace.  Ravenous Embrace (Su) Once per round, a creature grappling or grappled by a seraptis can be attacked by the ravenous, toothed wounds that decorate a seraptis's arms. These teeth bite and chew, inflicting an automatic 4d6+12 points of damage each round-in addition, the wounds caused by the ravenous embrace cause 2d6 bleed and 1d4 points of Strength drain as the seraptis drinks away the victim's blood and other vital fluids. As long as the seraptis is within 30 feet of a foe suffering bleed damage from her ravenous embrace, the blood that flows from the victim writhes through the air into the seraptis's arm maws, healing the seraptis by an amount equal to the amount caused by that round's bleed effect.

Aquatic Entangle (Su) Once every four rounds, a sojourner can animate the local sea flora to entrap its opponents. This ability functions as an entangle spell (Reflex DC 20 partial; CL 20th).  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A sojourner is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.  A magic missile paralyzes a sojourner (as the hold person spell) for 1 minute, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals cold damage breaks any hold effect on the sojourner and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the sojourner to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A sojourner gets no saving throw against cold effects.  A sojourner is unaffected by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.  Powerful Blows (Ex) A sojourner deals one and a half times its Strength modifier and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks.  Resilient (Ex) A sojourner gains bonus hit points as a construct as if it were two sizes larger.																												
Soul Reaper	15.00	51200	Large	8	29, touch 13, flat-footed 25	231	14	13	18	channel resistance +4, inseparable weapon	26		40 ft.	#ERROR!		10 ft.	10 ft.	soul slash	Str 27, Dex 19, Con -, Int 18, Wis 21, Cha 20	16	25	39	Tome of Horrors Complete	Soul Slash (Su) If a soul reaper scores a critical hit with its scythe, the target must succeed on a DC 26 Fortitude save or have its soul torn from its body and pulled into the soul reaper's scythe. If the save succeeds, the victim takes an extra 3d6 points of damage. A soul reaper's scythe can hold a number of souls equal to its Charisma bonus (four souls for a typical soul reaper). This effect is similar to a trap the soul spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.  A creature's soulless body collapses into a desiccated husk, and in one day crumbles to dust.  To reclaim a captured soul, the reaper must be destroyed and its scythe shattered on consecrated ground. When the scythe is shattered, all souls trapped are released and seek their original body (if it's been less than one day since the body was killed). Creatures without a body are left to wander in spirit form but can be returned to life through the successful casting of a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell.  Inseparable Weapon (Su) A soul reaper has a mystic and magical connection to its scythe. If separated from its scythe (if the soul reaper is disarmed, for example) and within 100 feet of it, it may summon it to its hands as a move action. If an opponent is holding the weapon when the reaper summons it, that opponent must succeed on a DC 26 Strength check or the weapon flies from its hands to the soul reaper. The check DC is Charisma-based.																												
Spirit of Adoration	15.00	51200	Large	4	32, touch 20, flat-footed 27	189	17	21	25		26		40 ft., fly 60 ft. (good)	#ERROR!	stunning bolt +21 (1d8 plus stun)	10 ft.	10 ft.		Str 18, Dex 19, Con 20, Int 19, Wis 22, Cha 23	18	23	44	AP 50	Aura of Charming (Su) The spirit's aura sways the feelings of creatures within 30 feet that have an attitude of unfriendly or worse. Such creatures must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be affected by charm monster for 1 day. Creatures that attack the spirit must save against the aura, regardless of their attitude. A creature that makes its save is immune to the spirit's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Bardic Knowledge (Ex) The spirit adds half her Hit Dice (+9) on all Knowledge checks and may make all Knowledge checks untrained.  Bardic Magic Each day, the spirit can cast any three bards spells of any level and in any combination. Her caster level for these bard spells is 18th. She may select any spells from the bard spell list when using this ability.  Bardic Performance (Su) The spirit has the bardic performance class ability. She can use bardic performance for 11 rounds per day, and has access to the following abilities: countersong, distraction, fascinate, and inspire courage (+5).  Inspiration (Su) The spirit can choose an intelligent creature to inspire and serve as a muse for by giving that creature some token of her power (typically a lock of her hair or a piece of her garment). As long as the spirit retains her favor for this creature and the creature carries the spirit's token, the creature gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. A bard who has the spirit for a muse in this way can use his bardic performance for an additional number of rounds per day equal to the spirit's Charisma bonus. The spirit retains a link to her token and its carrier as if she had cast a status spell on the carrier. The spirit can end this effect at any time as a free action, even if she is not on the same plane as the carrier. The spirit may inspire a number of creatures at a time equal to her Charisma bonus.  Stunning Bolt (Su) The spirit's stunning bolt is a ray of brilliant divine energy. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. Any creature that it strikes takes 1d8 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. If the target succeeds at this save, it is merely dazzled for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Unearthly Grace (Su) The spirit adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.																												
Stabbing Beast	15.00	51200	Medium	16	35, touch 23, flat-footed 22	225	18	18	15	all-around vision, scorpion mind	26		50 ft.	#ERROR!	poison stream +30 touch (blindness)	5 ft.	5 ft.	bleed 2d6, scorpion strike, sneak attack +5d6, sudden strike	Str 16, Dex 35, Con 24, Int 13, Wis 15, Cha 14	18	21	44	AP 59	Murderer's Reward (Su) If the Stabbing Beast's attack reduces a target to fewer than 0 hit points, the Beast immediately gains 2d6 temporary hit points. If the attack kills the target, the Beast immediately gains 3d8 temporary hit points. Neither aspect of this ability can heal the Stabbing Beast more than the maximum hit points of the target. The temporary hit points last for 1 hour.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 26; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison Stream (Ex) The Stabbing Beast can force a stream of poison from its stinger at a target as a ranged attack.  The target must make a successful DC 26 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. The Beast can make this attack in place of a melee sting attack (for example, attacking twice with its weapons or claws and once with its poison stream).  Scorpion Mind (Ex) Though the Stabbing Beast is an intelligent outsider, its mind functions much like an augmented vermin's brain, granting it a +4 bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects.  Scorpion Strike (Ex) The Stabbing Beast can make a single melee attack as a standard action. If this attack hits, it deals damage normally, and the target's base land speed is reduced to 5 feet for 2 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 21 Fortitude saving throw.  Sudden Strike (Ex) The Stabbing Beast is adept at moving quickly when its foes are surprised. During a surprise round, it may act as if it had a full round to act, rather than just one standard action.

Steward of the Skein	15.00	51200	Medium	7	31, touch 23, flat-footed 27	199	15	20	22		26		50 ft., fly 150 ft. (average)	2 slam +26 (2d10+7 plus gaze)		5 ft.	5 ft.	gaze, tug the strands of fate	Str 25, Dex 16, Con 20, Int 18, Wis 21, Cha 23	19	26	44	AP 44	Fate Aura (Su) The Steward's aura gives her a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. The aura makes her immune to possession and attempts to exercise mental control over her, as protection from evil (though it blocks these effects from non-evil sources as well). If a creature successfully strikes the Steward with a melee attack, it is blinded or takes 1d6 Strength damage (Steward's choice, DC 25 negates either effect). The fate aura also acts as consecrate, although this does not interfere with altars or other fixtures relating to deities. Fateful Resurrection (Su) As the herald of the goddess of death and birth, the Steward quickly recovers from being killed. She remains dead for only 1d4 rounds unless her body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate. Otherwise, she rises again 1d4 rounds after death, as if brought back to life via resurrection, and is fully healed. The Steward gains 1 permanent negative level when this occurs (though Pharasma typically removes it as soon as the herald returns to the Boneyard). The Steward can self-resurrect only once per day. If she dies a second time before that day passes, she is permanently dead (barring intervention by Pharasma or magic that can resurrect an outsider). Gaze (Su) In humanoid form, the Steward can use a 60-footrange gaze attack that dazes creatures for 2d6 rounds (Will negates, DC 25). Creatures who make their save are merely staggered for 1d6 rounds. Creatures of 5 HD or less who fail their save are stunned instead of dazed. Undead who fail their saves are held immobile (as halt undead) for 2d6 rounds rather than stunned or staggered. A creature that saves against the Steward's gaze cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. The Steward is immune to her own gaze. This is a mind-affecting effect (or a necromancy effect against undead). A creature struck by the Steward's slam attack must save or be affected by her gaze attack. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Incorporeal Form (Su) The Steward can become incorporeal or return to her normal form as a standard action. When incorporeal, she can use her spell-like abilities and gaze attack but can't make physical attacks against corporeal creatures. Her appearance changes radically when she is incorporeal, looking like a burning orange spirit of darkness (this duality has led some to believe Pharasma actually has two heralds). Lady's Blessing (Su) This special blessing is normally only given to important heroes of the faith or children with a significant destiny. The touched target gains a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks, and foes take a -1 penalty on such rolls directed against the target. This blessing lasts one year. The Steward can use this ability at will, but only does so at the direction of Pharasma, and never on herself. Tug the Strands of Fate (Su) The Steward can influence a creature's fate, forcing a creature within 100 feet and line of sight to reroll any one roll that it has made before the result of the roll is revealed. The result of the reroll must be taken, even if it is worse than the original roll. The Steward can use this ability 3 times per day.

Any creature striking the herald from within her aura either is blinded or takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (herald's choice, Will DC 25 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Gaze (Su) Dazed 2d6 rounds (or stunned if 5 HD or fewer, or held for 2d6 rounds if undead), 60 feet; Will DC 25 negates.  A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect (or a necromancy effect against undead). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Incorporeal Form (Su) When incorporeal, the herald can use her spell-like abilities and gaze attack but can't make slam attacks.

Choose a ranger favored terrain type. A stormghost gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks within that terrain type. A stormghost moving into a different terrain type must remain there for 1d4 weeks before the racial bonus applies to the new terrain type.  Impaling Leap (Ex) As a standard action, a stormghost can jump into the air and land on a single target at least one size category smaller than itself, using its spiky legs to impale the victim. The target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or it takes 4d8+12 points of piercing damage and is pinned. If the stormghost chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage each from the impaling leap each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Constitution-based.  See in Fog (Ex) A stormghost can see in fog and foglike conditions without penalty.  Static Aura (Su) A stormghost can surround itself with crackling electricity that leaps from its body, affecting nearby creatures. All creatures within 5 feet of the stormghost take 2d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the stormghost's turn.  Static Blast (Su) As a standard action, a stormghost can focus its static charge into a bolt, releasing it in a 40-foot line that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage. A successful DC 25 Reflex save halves this damage. A stormghost can use its static blast once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

As a standard action, a stringy demodand can use its growths to entangle any adjacent creatures of its size or smaller. To resist being entangled, a target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save. As long as the stringy demodand is entangling one or more creatures, any creature that moves adjacent to the demodand must successfully save or likewise be entangled. Entangled creatures can't move farther than 5 feet from the stringy demodand until they break free from its growths. An entangled creature can break free as a move  action by succeeding at a DC 25 Strength or Escape Artist check. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Protective Aura (Su) In addition to the normal effects of an angel's protective aura, Thalachos's aura grants the benefits of the endure elements spell.  Stun (Su) If Thalachos strikes a creature twice in the same round with his scimitars (whether two strikes with one scimitar or one strike with each), that creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.

Using this ability within oil or tar reduces its range to 30 feet. A targotha cannot use this ability in water. A jolt deals 12d6 points of electricity damage, and the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude 28 negates the stun effect). It can use this ability once every 1d4+1 rounds, during which the targotha cannot ignite its volatile breath. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Razor Fins (Ex) A targotha's razor fins threaten a critical hit on a 19 or 20, augmented to 17-20 by its Improved Critical feat.  Slippery (Ex) A targotha secretes a thick mucus that allows it to move gracefully through viscous fluids like tar and oil. This mucus dissolves away adhesives (such as sovereign glue, tanglefoot bags, and webs) in 1d4 rounds.  Additionally, all combat maneuver checks to grapple a targotha automatically fail. The targotha automatically succeeds at any combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to escape a grapple or a pin.  Tail Slap (Ex) A targotha adds 1-1/2  its Strength modifier on damage rolls for its tail slap. It can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against a creature struck by its tail slap as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.  The targotha can't move as part of this bull rush.  Volatile Breath (Ex) A targotha can breathe a cone of flammable gas as a breath weapon. As a swift action, it can ignite the gas with its jolt ability. When ignited, the gas explodes, dealing 15d6 points of fire damage in the area of the cone (Reflex DC 28 half). If not ignited, the gas confuses all creatures in the area of effect that breathe it in before the gas dissipates at the start of the targotha's next turn. This confusion last for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 23 negates). The save DCs are Constitution-based, and the confusion save DC has a -5 racial penalty.

If a tataka gains monk levels, it uses its tataka unarmed strike damage or its monk unarmed strike damage, whichever is higher. Its unarmed strikes function as lawful and evil weapons for overcoming damage reduction.  Spells A tataka casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. A tataka can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a tataka.

Howl of Despair (Su) The Prince in Chains can loose a howl of immortal agony once every 1d4 rounds. All nonevil creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will saving throw or take 6d6 points of sonic damage. Any within 10 feet who fail their saves are also affected as per the insanity spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that fails its save against the herald's unnerving gaze is staggered for 1 round. Vicious Critical (Ex) If the herald confirms a critical hit, the attack also deals 2 points of Constitution damage.

Its slams count as natural weapons or manufactured weapons (whichever is most beneficial to it) for the purpose of spells that enhance attacks, and as adamantine, chaotic, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.  Ironsense (Ex) The First Blade automatically detects iron objects within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Immunity to Magic (Su) The First Blade has the same immunity to magic as an iron golem. It can lower this resistance for 1 round as a standard action.  Lord of Battle (Ex) The First Blade is proficient in all weapons, and counts as an 18th-level barbarian and fighter for the purposes of all prerequisites.  Rage Aura (Su) Willing creatures within 100 feet of the First Blade gain the effects of rage automatically, whether they are allies or enemies of the herald. Those who choose not to be affected are immune to the aura until they leave the area and return.  Swarm Form (Su) The herald can transform into a floating swarm of Tiny sharp metal fragments. In this form it has the swarm subtype, cannot make slam attacks, gains the distraction ability (DC 28), and can make a swarm attack that deals 4d6 points of slashing damage to its targets.																												
The Grand Defender	15.00	51200	Huge	3	32, touch 7, flat-footed 32	157	6	5	7				30 ft.	warhammer +27/+22/+17/+12 (3d6+11/x3)		15 ft.	15 ft.	breath weapon, hammer storm	Str 32, Dex 9, Con -, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 13	18	+40 (+44 bull rush)	53 (55 vs. bull rush, 57 vs. trip)	Inner Sea Gods	Ablative Adaptation (Su) As a standard action, the Grand Defender can shed its outer layer of metal, revealing a slightly smaller version of itself underneath. This new form may be made of cold iron (changing its DR to 15/cold iron), mithral (DR 15/silver), or iron (DR 15/adamantine, as normal). Its attacks count as this metal type for overcoming damage reduction. If the herald is brought to 0 hit points, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds its outer layer and reanimates at half its normal hit points.  Once shed, the outer layer decays into worthless powder over 1d4 minutes.  Breath Weapon (Su) The herald's poisonous breath weapon functions like that of an iron golem (free action every 1d4 rounds, 10 ft. cube, Fort DC 19, 1d4 Con, 2 consecutive saves). The save DC is Constitution-based. The cloud persists for 1 round.  Defender's Shield (Ex) The herald's shield is a +3 heavy steel shield, though it becomes nonmagical if the herald is destroyed or is no longer holding or wearing it.  Hammer Storm (Ex) The herald can expel a volley of warhammers from its mouth, which functions like a breath weapon (30-foot cone, 15d6 bludgeoning damage plus Awesome Blow, Reflex 19 half, usable 1/day). If the herald is in its cold iron or mithral form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver, respectively. The herald can exclude any number of squares in the cone. The hammer storm creates 24 physical warhammers that persist after the instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures (though they're normal warhammers, not masterwork, cold iron, or mithral). The herald can spend 1 minute eating 24 warhammers (or an equivalent amount of metal such as that created by its ablative adaptation ability) to recharge this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Immunity to Magic (Su) The herald has the same immunity to magic as an iron golem.

All who worship Erastil immediately recognize the sound and know the direction and general distance to it.  Cascade of Spears (Su) Once per day, the Stag can shed fragments of its antlers, creating up to 18 +1 shortspears, +1 spears, or +1 longspears in any combination (or substitute five +1 arrows or +1 crossbow bolts for each spear). These weapons retain their magic for 18 minutes, after which they become common weapons made of antler.  Heroes' Feast (Sp) The Stag lies down and dies to begin the "casting" of this ability, its body becoming a magical feast feeding up to 18 creatures. At the next sunrise, it returns to life with full hit points.

Any creature that fails a DC 25 Fortitude save against the aura improves its attitude toward the Menotherian one step closer to friendly. Creatures with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on this saving throw. Creatures in the aura must attempt a saving throw each minute. This is a mindaffecting poison effect. The DC is Constitution-based.  Implant (Ex) Once per day, the Menotherian can implant eggs in a creature using its sting. The creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save to resist implantation. The target is nauseated for the next 2d4 rounds while the eggs gestate. When the eggs hatch, they form a chaotic neutral hellwasp swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 146), kill the host in 1 round, and inhabit the corpse. The eggs can be surgically removed with a successful DC 30 Heal check (this check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host regardless of success) or by remove disease or similar spells. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Mind Control (Ex) The menotherian can inject its scent into the brain of a helpless or willing target, controlling it for the next 24 hours (as the spell dominate person, Fortitude DC 25 negates), although the Menotherian must verbally give the target instructions. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Inspiration (Su) The Spirit of Adoration can inspire an intelligent creature by giving it a token of her favor. As long as the creature carries her token, it gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks.  An inspired bard adds the spirit's Charisma bonus (+6) to his number of bardic performance rounds per day. The spirit retains a link to her token and its carrier as if she had cast the spell status on the carrier. The spirit can end this effect at any time as a free action. The spirit may inspire a number of creatures at a time equal to her Charisma bonus.  Stunning Ray (Su) This ray of brilliant energy has a range of 180 feet. The target takes 1d8 points of damage and is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Will DC 24 reduces this to dazzled). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Unearthly Grace (Su) The spirit adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws, as well as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.

Murderer's Reward (Su) If the Stabbing Beast's attack reduces a target to fewer than 0 hit points, the herald immediately gains 2d6 temporary hit points (or 3d8, if the attack kills the target), but no more than the target's maximum hit points. The temporary hit points last for 1 hour. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. Poison Stream (Ex) As a ranged attack (or in place of a melee sting attack), the Stabbing Beast can fire a stream of poison up to 180 feet at an opponent's eyes. The target must succeed at a save against the Stabbing Beast's poison or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. Sudden Strike (Ex) During a surprise round, the herald may act as if it had a full round to act, rather than just one standard action.																												
Toshigami	15.00	51200	Medium	10	30, touch 20, flat-footed 22	210	11	23	9		26		60 ft., fly 90 ft. (good) (30 ft., fly 60 ft. [good] without haste)	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 15, Dex 22, Con 20, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 25	20	11	27	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Touch of Ages (Su) When a toshigami hits a target with a touch attack or any melee weapon, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid being magically aged. When a toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to physically increase the target's age or mentally reduce the  target's age. If it increases the target's physical age, the target takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If it decreases the target's mental age, the target takes 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Combined with the toshigami's numerous attacks, this can quickly devastate a target, but once a target succeeds at its saving throw against the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for 1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually alter the victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind. The save DC is Charisma-based.

If rocks are available (as when the ulkreth uses its ground pounder ability to create rubble) it can pick up a single rock as a swift action, two rocks as a move action, or four rocks as a full-round action. If an ulkreth has a rock in each hand, it cannot use its rock catching ability.  Ground Pounder (Ex) As a standard action, an ulkreth can strike the ground with its powerful fists, turning the area within a 10-foot radius into dense rubble (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 412). Any creatures in this area at the time must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or fall prone. An ulkreth's movement is not slowed by the rubble it creates.  Punch Through (Ex) An ulkreth can use a full-attack action to make its gore and slam attacks against the same opponent. The ulkreth then totals the damage from all hits before applying any damage reduction or hardness.  Wrecker (Su) An ulkreth's rend special attack deals double damage to objects.																												
Very Old Black Dragon	15.00	51200	Huge	4	35, touch 8, flat-footed 35	250	18	12	16		26		60 ft., fly 200 ft.

(15 ft. with bite)	acidic bite, breath weapon (100-ft. line, DC 26, 18d6 acid), corrupt water, crush (DC 26, 2d8+15)	Str 31, Dex 10, Con 23, Int 16, Wis 19, Cha 16	20	32	42 (46 vs. trip)	d20pfsrd	Acidic Bite (Su) At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence. Crush (Ex) A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus. Speak with Reptiles (Sp) A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals. Swamp Stride (Ex) A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. Water Breathing (Ex) A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

This functions as gust of wind, but any creature in its path must make a Fortitude save (DC 26) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand.  Fire Aura (Su) An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient brass dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A brass dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.  Move Sand (Su) A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell.  Sleep Breath (Su) Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a 50 ft. cone of sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+9 rounds.

Any creature that begins its turn within the entropic breath becomes confused (Will DC 25 negates) for as long as it remains within the cloud and for 1d6 rounds thereafter.  Maw of the Abyss (Su) As a full-round action, a woundwyrm can attempt to suck creatures and unattended objects in a 15-foot cone into a vortex in its maw. This acts as a drag combat maneuver (CMB +30) against creatures, and acts as a Strength check with a +10 bonus to break objects. Unattended objects weighing less than 100 pounds are automatically drawn into its maw. Creatures and objects alike take 1d12 points of sonic damage per round within the cone. While using this ability, a woundwyrm cannot speak, use its breath weapon, or make attacks or attacks of opportunity with its bite attack.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Fiendish Bile: effect 1d4 Str damage (good-aligned creatures also take 2d8 points of damage).  Mysterious Blood: effect 1d4 Dex and 1d4 Wis damage plus confusion for 1 round.  Vile Disjunction: effect targeted greater dispel magic (CL 18th) on the creature.  Redirect Spell (Su) Any creature that attempts to cast a spell within 30 feet of a xacarba must cast the spell defensively. If the caster fails the concentration check to do so (or if the caster opts to not cast defensively), the xacarba can choose the target of the spell as an immediate action. The new target must be a legal target-if there's no legal alternative target to choose from, this ability cannot be used.

This is a sonic mindaffecting fear effect. Evil outsiders are immune to this ability.  Whether or not it succeeds at its save, a creature in the area is immune to the Yethazmari's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Breath Weapon (Su) The Yethazmari's breath weapon is a jet of smoke. Any nonchaotic creature that takes damage from this breath weapon must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be confused for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Soul Scream (Su) Anytime the Yethazmari takes piercing or slashing damage, its wounds create a terrifying cacophony equivalent to its bay ability. Creatures within 10 feet of it take a -4 penalty on their saves against this effect.  Poison (Ex) Contact or bite-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.

It gains a +6 bonus on saves against charm and compulsion effects. Destructive Charge (Ex) A ypotryll's charge attack ignores up to 1 point of a target object's hardness for each 5 feet charged.  Thundering Path (Ex) A ypotryll's charge shakes the ground it crosses. The path of its charge is considered difficult terrain until the start of the ypotryll's next turn, and creatures with tremorsense that are within 100 feet of the end of the ypotryll's charge are blinded for that same amount of time.  Unstoppable Force (Ex) A ypotryll's bonus on a charge attack is +4, and it may add this bonus on overrun combat maneuver checks attempted using Charge Through.

If the gigas ventures onto another plane, it cannot make use of these abilities (though its other spelllike abilities remain available). The save DC for the spell-like abilities is Charisma-based and includes a +5 racial bonus. Wrenching Spasms (Su) When an Abyss gigas hits an opponent with its bite attack, the opponent must make a DC 29 Fort save or be overcome by wrenching spasms that wrack its body. These spasms cause the victim to be nauseated and deal 1d6 points of damage to Strength and Dexterity due to the painful contortion of bones, muscles, and limbs. The spasms continue for 1d6 hours or until healed with heal, regenerate, or greater restoration. The effects of this ability do not stack, but once a creature has recovered from or been cured of the effect, it can be affected again. Once a creature has made a successful saving throw against this effect, it cannot be affected by the wrenching spasms from that particular gigas for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

With the addath's erratic movements in combat, any creature adjacent to and attacking the addath has a chance of being hit by the bristles. Each time a creature attacks an addath with a melee attack it must make a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid being punctured by several bristles. Each time a creature is punctured by these bristles, it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the addath's poison. A creature that grapples an addath is automatically hurt by these bristles. The save DC to avoid the bristles is Dexterity-based.  Poison (Ex) Bristles or bite-injury; save DC 26 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Strength damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spider Poison Immunity (Ex) An addath is immune to the venom of ordinary spiders, giant spiders, and phase spiders.  Tentacles (Ex) The addath's tentacles are always a primary attack for the creature. It can transfer a grabbed creature from a tentacle to its mouth as a move action.

This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per age category of the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon's breath weapon (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the total damage dice of the pool is halved until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface. Acidic Bite (Su) At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. Charm Reptiles (Sp) A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a mass charm monster spell that affects only reptilian animals. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence. Speak with Reptiles (Sp) A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals.

The save DC for this effect is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Fire Aura (Su) An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient brass dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A brass dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action. Move Sand (Sp) A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell. Sandstorm (Su) An ancient or older brass dragon can create a powerful sandstorm once per day as a full-round action. This storm has a radius of 1 mile and lasts for 1 minute per age category of the dragon. This functions as a sandstorm (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431), except that it is also accompanied by windstorm-level winds.

Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger the ship is than the brine dragon's size, the dragon takes a cumulative -10 penalty on the check.  Desiccating Bite (Su) An ancient brine dragon's bite causes weakness, dealing 1d2 points of Strength drain in addition to its normal damage. A great wyrm's bite deals 1d4 points of Strength drain. A Fortitude save (DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC) negates the Strength drain.  Painful Strikes (Su) A great wyrm brine dragon's natural attacks are so laden with salt and acidic crystals that every time it strikes a creature with one of these attacks, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC) or be stunned for a round from the pain.

Very young-speak with animals (fish only); Young- obscuring mist; Juvenile-water breathing; Adult-control water; Ancient-horrid wilting (3/day); Great wyrm-tsunami* (3/day).

When a cloud dragon uses its breath weapon, make a single bull rush attack using the dragon's CMB against the CMD of any creature that failed its Reflex save and is three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. This bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the dragon cannot choose to move with any opponent pushed back. In addition to being pushed back, affected creatures are knocked prone and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back. Flying creatures are buffeted and pushed back twice the distance and sustain 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back. Cold Bite (Su) At old age, a cloud dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of cold damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6.

Cloud Vision (Ex) A very young cloud dragon can see perfectly in foggy conditions (such as those created by fog cloud or obscuring mist). Immunity to Winds (Su) A cloud dragon is immune to the effects of wind. It ignores the penalties applied to the Fly skill incurred by wind speed, and is immune to the negative effects of any spell or effect that manipulates wind, such as gust of wind and whirlwind.

Young-create water; Juvenile-obscuring mist; Adult-stinking cloud; Old-call lightning; Ancient-control winds; Great Wyrm-control weather. Whirlwind (Sp) A great wyrm cloud dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a whirlwind spell. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.

An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. Breath Weapon (Su) A mist dragon's breath weapon is a cone of cloudy scalding vapor. In still air, the vapor lingers for 1d4 rounds and forms a cloud that covers a radius equal to the cone's length; on the second round, the vapor condenses into a heated smothering fog that deals 1d6 points of fire damage to creatures each round they remain in the area (Fortitude save halves this damage). The fog also blinds creatures (as the blindness spell) that fail the save as long as they remain within in the cloud and for 2 rounds after they leave the area. Mist Form (Su) As a standard action, a juvenile or older mist dragon can assume gaseous form, but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. A great wyrm mist dragon's abilities while in mist form improve drastically. As a standard action a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can make a single melee attack of its choice at its highest attack bonus. This attack deals normal damage. As a full-round action, a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can attack with its breath weapon. Mist Vision (Ex) A very young mist dragon can see perfectly in foggy conditions (such as those created by fog cloud or obscuring mist).

Change Shape (Su) A young or older underworld dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.  Lava Eruption (Su) As a full-round action, a great wyrm underworld dragon can burrow through the ground up to twice its burrow speed. At the end of that movement, if the underworld dragon has use of its breath weapon, it can emerge from the ground spouting lava in a 30-foot-radius burst, dealing damage as the breath weapon.  Smoke Vision (Ex) A very young and older underworld dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics).  Underworld Burrower (Ex) An adult underworld dragon gains a 10-foot bonus to its burrow speed.

Chain Guns (Ex) These advanced firearms have a range increment of 200 feet, automatically reload as a free action, and never misfire. An annihilator's core can process scrap metal into new ammunition, effectively giving the annihilator infinite ammo with these weapons.  Combined Arms (Ex) When taking a full attack action, an annihilator can attack with melee and ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.  Plasma Lance (Ex) As a standard action once every 3 rounds, an annihilator may fire a 120-foot-long line of plasma from its tail. All creatures in this area take 20d6 points of plasma damage (Reflex DC 22 halves). The save DC is Intelligence-based.  Suppressing Fire (Ex) As a standard action, an annihilator can use its chain guns to fire in a 100-foot cone. When it does so, it makes a single chain gun attack against every target in this area.

This ability only works on living creatures, which may resist with a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw. The save is Constitution-based. For every 5 HD of the slain creature, the daemon gains a +1 profane bonus on attacks, saving throws, and checks for 24 hours. This ability does not consume all of the soul, and pieces of it still exist after the daemon completes its feast (enough to be able to resurrect the slain victim normally).  Soul Siphon (Su) If a Small or larger living creature dies within 10 feet of an astradaemon, the daemon gains 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 bonus to Strength for 10 minutes. These bonuses stack with themselves. Incorporeal undead and living spirits traveling outside the body (such as a person using astral projection or magic jar) take 1d8 points of damage each round within the daemon's aura.																												
Belier Devil	16.00	76800	Large	10	33, touch 15, flat-footed 27	212	17	11	20		28		20 ft., fly 60 ft. (perfect)	bite +23 (4d8+7), 3 tongues +23 (2d6+7/19-20 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.

It does not require a receptacle to use magic jar. If it uses magic jar on a host while on the Material Plane, its own body becomes ethereal for the duration of the possession and the magic jar effect lasts until the effect is dispelled, the devil ends the effect, it is forced out of its host body, or it or its host body is slain.

For every 4 points of Con damage sustained by the victim, a random limb is lost and can only be recovered by regeneration or similar magic. Black Rot: Swarm- contact; save DC 29 Fort; onset immediate; frequency 1/ day; effect 1d6 Con damage, 1d6 Dex damage, and 1d3 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

The victim gains all of the penalties from this aging and none of the bonuses. A venerable victim targeted by this ability dies if it fails a DC 24 Fortitude save. This process is reversible with greater restoration, limited wish, miracle, or wish. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Confusion Gaze (Su) Confusion for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 24 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Temporal Strike (Su) As a standard action, a bythos can touch a creature or object to displace it from time. If the target fails a DC 24 Fortitude save, it disappears from the present moment and reappears in the same location 1d4 rounds later as if no time had passed. If an object occupies that space, the creature appears in the closest available space to its original location-this displacement does not cause the creature any additional harm. The save DC is Charisma-based.

It is not secreted through her skin (therefore her touch is not poisonous); rather it is delivered through the exchange of body fluids with another creature (kissing, consummating an encounter, etc.). If a target is not willing to be kissed, she must start a grapple to do so. Caizel's Poison: Kiss-contact; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d8 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Touch of Ecstasy (Su) Once per round, by making a melee touch attack against a foe, Caizel can flood the creature's mind with the most pleasurable images it can conjure if it fails a DC 25 Will save. This effect stuns the creature for 1d4 rounds while its mind processes the information. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by Caizel's touch of ecstasy for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based. Caizel can suppress this ability at will. Bonerazor: Bonerazor is a finely crafted and perfectly balanced +2 dagger. Because of its expert craftsmanship it deals 2d4 points of damage on a successful hit. Additionally, a creature hit must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be held (as by a hold person spell, CL 20th). The creature can make a new save each round to escape. A creature remains held as long as Bonerazor remains embedded in its body or until it makes a successful Fortitude save. So long as Caizel is within 50 feet of it, she can command the dagger to return to her hand as a free action.

Efficient Winding (Ex) Built for long and dangerous missions, a clockwork dragon can function for 3 days per Hit Die each time it's wound.  Self-Destruction (Ex) When a clockwork dragon's hit points are reduced to 10% of its total (17 in the case of most clockwork dragons) or less but are still above 0, the creature self-destructs on its next turn, bursting into an explosion of metal scraps and steam that deals 10d6 points of slashing damage plus 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save is Charisma-based.																												
Ecorche	16.00	76800	Large	9	30, touch 14, flat-footed 25	209	12	12	15	channel resistance +2			30 ft.	2 claws +27 (3d6+11/19-20)		10 ft.	10 ft.	bleed (1 Con drain), rend (2 claws, 3d6+11 plus bleed and seize skin)	Str 32, Dex 20, Con -, Int 9, Wis 11, Cha 21	16	28	43	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Seize Skin (Su) Whenever an ecorche damages a target with its rend ability, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save to resist being skinned alive. Those who fail the save become staggered and take 1 point of Constitution drain per round. Both of these effects are permanent but can be removed with a regenerate or heal spell (or 1 round of regeneration). The ecorche can use its wear skin ability to don a skin stolen in this way as a full-round action. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Wear Skin (Su)An ecorche can steal the skin of a dead Small, Medium, or Large humanoid and wear it as its own. When it does this, the ecorche takes on the creature's size and appearance and gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate the victim. While wearing a stolen skin, an ecorche cannot use its frightful presence. This stolen skin is preserved while the ecorche wears it, but is destroyed if the ecorche takes more than 10 points of damage or if the ecorche chooses to destroy the skin as a standard action.  Those within 60 feet who see an ecorche's stolen skin destroyed are immediately subjected to its frightful presence and take a -5 penalty on the related Will save. An ecorche reverts to its normal size if its stolen skin is destroyed.																												
Elder Sphinx	16.00	76800	Gargantuan	5	29, touch 7, flat-footed 28	241	18	15	19	enciphered mind	27		40 ft., fly 60 ft.

Any creature attempting to contact an elder sphinx's mind or read its thoughts with a divination spell or similar ability must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be overwhelmed by the chaos and vast scope of the knowledge within. Those who fail are affected by feeblemind. An elder sphinx can willingly suppress this ability at will as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Enigma (Su) Elder sphinxes have removed themselves from the mundane world to contemplate the mysteries of the universe-and beyond. To facilitate this, they possess an uncanny ability to elude detection and discovery by those that could possibly interrupt their meditations. Any creature (other than another sphinx), that leaves line of sight of an elder sphinx for more than 1 hour must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be unable to recall details of the encounter, as if the sphinx cast modify memory to eliminate all recollection of itself. The exact details of this memory loss are decided by the elder sphinx subconsciously during the encounter and it may eliminate up to an hour of memories. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Litany of Riddles (Su) As a standard action, an elder sphinx can telepathically project a befuddling series of riddles, puzzles, and logic paradoxes at all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this effect must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed against this effect glean snippets of lore from this brush with the sphinx's mind, granting them a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks for 1 hour and the ability to attempt Knowledge checks with a DC higher than 10 untrained. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it can't be affected by the same elder sphinx's litany of riddles for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Sphinx Monolith (Su) An elder sphinx can enter a state of suspended animation and transform its massive body into a stone monument. This transformation takes 1 minute to complete, during which the elder sphinx is immobile. Once it transforms into its monolith form, the elder sphinx's body hardens to stone, granting it hardness 30 and 350 hit points. If the elder sphinx's stony body is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and the elder sphinx is slain. While transformed, an elder sphinx doesn't need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. The elder sphinx is aware of its surroundings and it can use astral projection at will when in this form. Anytime an elder sphinx's body takes damage while using astral projection, its astral form immediately becomes aware that it is in danger and can, as a free action, end the astral projection and begin reverting back to its natural form (though the process still takes 1 minute). When an elder sphinx ends its transformation, it is immediately healed of all hit point damage it may have sustained while transformed. An elder sphinx can remain in its sphinx monolith form indefinitely.																												
Ephialtes Kyton	16.00	76800	Huge	6	30, touch 10, flat-footed 28	243	14	13	14	chain armor	27		30 ft.	bite +24 (2d6+8), 2 chains +25 (2d8+8/19-20), 2 claws +24 (1d8+8), tail +19 (1d8+4)		15 ft.	15 ft. (30 ft. with chains)	breath weapon (50-ft. cone, 2d8+8 piercing damage plus grab, Reflex DC 27 for half, usable every 1d4 rounds) dancing chains, entrapping chains, pull (breath weapon, 10 feet), rend (2 chains, 2d8+12)	Str 26, Dex 14, Con 26, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 16	18	+28 (+32 grapple or pull)	40 (44 vs. trip)	AP 30	Breath Weapon (Su) As a full-round action, an ephialtes kyton may exhale a spread of barbed, grappling chains anchored within its massive maw, targeting up to six creatures in a 50-foot cone. Those failing a DC 27 Reflex save suffer 2d8+8 points of piercing damage and the kyton may make a combat maneuver check as an immediate action to grapple each victim with the animate chains. A successful save cuts the damage in half and avoids the grapple opportunity. Those successfully grappled by the chains become subject to the kyton's pull ability. A kyton cannot use its breath weapon again while it is grappling or pulling creatures with its breath weapon chains. Otherwise, it may use the breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. An ephialtes kyton's chains (hardness 10, hp 10, Break DC 26) can be broken, or attacked by making a sunder attempt. If the chain is currently grappling a target, the attacker gains a +4 circumstance bonus on the CMB check to sunder. Severing a chain deals no damage to a kyton. Chain Armor (Ex) The chains that adorn an ephialtes kyton grant it a +8 armor bonus, but are not treated as armor for the purpose of arcane spell failure, armor check penalties, maximum Dexterity, weight, or proficiency. Dancing Chains (Su) An ephialtes kyton can control up to four chains within 30 feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, the kyton can increase these chains' length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-sharp barbs. The chains attack as effectively as the kyton itself. If a chain is in another creature's possession, the creature can attempt a DC 22 Will save to break the ephialtes kyton's power over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 hours or until the chain leaves the other creature's possession. An ephialtes kyton can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without making Climb checks. The save DC is Charisma-based. Entrapping Chains (Su) With a successful combat maneuver check, an ephialtes kyton may transfer an adjacent creature grappled by the kyton's breath weapon chains to the chains adorning its body, giving the target the pinned condition while the kyton deals with remaining foes. The kyton does not retain the grappled condition while pinning such creatures. Pinned victims can free themselves with a combat maneuver check to break the pin or an Escape Artist check. Other creatures can attempt to free pinned victims by making a sunder attempt (hardness 10, hp 10). An ephialtes kyton may entrap 1 Large, 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents. Pull (Ex) An ephialtes kyton has a +4 racial bonus on CMB checks made using its pull special attack.

The freezing liquid quickly hardens to sheets of ice, causing any creature that takes damage to move at only half its normal speed for 1d4 rounds. A DC 27 Strength check made as a full-round action allows a character to break free of the ice before this duration expires. The save DC and Strength check DC are Constitution-based.  Death Curse (Su) Curse of Drowning: save Will DC 26; effect creature can never gain the benefit of water breathing, and if it possesses this ability, loses it as long as it suffers the curse. In addition, the creature can hold its breath only half as long as normal, and whenever the cursed creature holds its breath, it functions as if sickened.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 3d6 cold damage and 1d6 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves.																												
Flayed Angel	16.00	76800	Large	8	32, touch 24, flat-footed 27	252	17	14	19	channel resistance +6, profane presence	27		40 ft.	2 slams +25 (2d6+7/19-20 plus 2d6 acid)		10 ft.	10 ft.	gout of blood, rend (2 slams, 3d6+10 plus 2d6 acid)	Str 25, Dex 18, Con -, Int 6, Wis 16, Cha 21	18	26	51	Tome of Horrors 4	Gout of Blood (Ex) Whenever a flayed angel is physically struck in battle, the impact causes a spray of acidic blood to fly off the creature at anyone within 5 feet. Anyone in the area of affect must make a DC 24 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of acid damage from this splatter. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Profane Presence (Su) The existence of a flayed angel is such an anathema to the order of the multiverse that its very presence is a profanity of nature. This presence provides it with a +10 profane bonus to Armor Class and a +2 profane bonus to its saves.																												
Flesh Colossus	16.00	76800	Gargantuan	0	30, touch 6, flat-footed 30	224	5	5	5				60 ft.	2 slams +28 (2d12+16/19-20/x3 plus grab) or stomp +28 (4d12+24 plus pinning stomp)		20 ft.	20 ft.	constrict (2d12+16), mythic power (6/day, surge +1d8), mythic quickening, pinning stomp	Str 42, Dex 11, Con -, Int 3, Wis 10, Cha 7	16	36	46	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Alternate Form (Ex) As a full-round action, a flesh colossus can break apart into four composite creatures. These composite creatures are identical to flesh golems (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 160) but lack the golem's DR and the berserk and immunity to magic abilities. They gain DR 5/epic, electricity absorption, and selective antimagic aura (10 feet). Divide the colossus's current total hit points by 4 to determine how many hit points each composite creature has. Reverting into a single form requires all of the remaining composite creatures to be adjacent to each other and a full-round action. When this occurs, add up the remaining hit points to determine the colossus's total hit points.  Selective Antimagic Aura (Su) Spells and abilities with the electricity descriptor or that deal electricity damage are unaffected by this field, as are necromancy spells and effects.																												
Gallowdead	16.00	76800	Medium	8	31, touch 15, flat-footed 26	228	13	12	17	channel resistance +6			30 ft.	spiked chain +26/+21/+16/+11 (2d4+10/19-20 plus chains of the dead) or 2 claws +25 (2d8+7)		5 ft.	5 ft.	chains of the dead  Space 5 ft.; Reach 5 ft. (10 ft. with spiked chain)	Str 24, Dex 19, Con -, Int 11, Wis 16, Cha 21	18	25	40	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Aura of Whispers (Su) A gallowdead constantly whispers vile secrets and blasphemous chants. Any creature within 30 feet of a gallowdead must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Already shaken creatures that fail this saving throw become nauseated by the secrets revealed. Each round, an affected creature can make a new Will save to recover from the effect-once a creature recovers from a gallowdead's whispers, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Each overlapping whisper aura from additional gallowdead increases the save DC by 2. This is a language-based sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Chains of the Dead (Su) When a gallowdead uses its spiked chain, the first attack that hits a foe during the gallowdead's turn deals an extra 12d6 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 27 half). This has no effect on undead creatures. In addition, the gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver check against its target with a +4 racial bonus. If the check succeeds, the target becomes grappled, but the gallowdead doesn't gain the grappled condition. The gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver check each round to maintain its grip on the victim, but can't take any special grapple actions against the victim except the move special action. When grappling a victim in this way, the gallowdead can't attack with its spiked chain. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Ghaddar Devil	16.00	76800	Huge	9	33, touch 13, flat-footed 28	200	14	15	12		27		40 ft.	2 claws +26 (2d6+11 plus grab), bite +25 (2d8+11 plus  vorpal bite)		15 ft.	15 ft.	feed	Str 33, Dex 21, Con 24, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 18	16	29	44	Tome of Horrors Complete	Feed (Su) When a ghaddar slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising and resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.  A ghaddar advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a ghaddar devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements normally.  The ghaddar only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total.  Vorpal Bite (Ex) If a ghaddar scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with its bite attack and confirms the critical hit, it severs the foe's head.																												
Grootslang	16.00	76800	Gargantuan	4	31, touch 11, flat-footed 26	283	20	16	12		27		40 ft., swim 30 ft.	bite +30 (4d8+13/19-20), 2 stomps +27 (2d6+6), tail slap +27 (2d6+6)		20 ft.	20 ft.	impaling bite, thunderous stomp (DC 28), trample (2d6+19, DC 33)	Str 36, Dex 19, Con 26, Int 15, Wis 20, Cha 15	21	+38 (+40 bull rush)	53 (55 vs. bull rush or trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Aquatic Elusion (Su) As a standard action, a grootslang that is fully immersed in water can teleport to another body of water without error. This ability functions like tree stride, but the grootslang can exit from any body of water within 1 mile so long as both the entry and exit are wide enough for the creature to enter.  Impaling Bite (Ex) A grootslang can make a bite attack against any creature it is grappling. If this attack hits, it is automatically treated as a critical threat.  Thunderous Stomp (Ex) As a full-round action, a grootslang can rear up on its serpentine body to bring its massive forelimbs down with awesome force. The grootslang chooses two adjacent targets to be affected as though trampling them. In addition, each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 28 Reflex save or be knocked prone. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Ha-Naga	16.00	76800	Huge	10	31, touch 15, flat-footed 24	250	14	14	15		27		50 ft., fly 80 ft.

The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save DC 28 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Hollow Serpent	16.00	76800	Large	9	31, touch 19, flat-footed 21	230	14	17	18	channel resistance +4, freedom of movement	27		50 ft., climb 50 ft.	2 bites +23 (4d10+10 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	channel negative energy (8d6, DC 24, 9/day), constrict (4d10+10 plus energy drain), energy drain (1 level, DC 26), life-draining coils	Str 25, Dex 29, Con -, Int 6, Wis 19, Cha 22	15	+25 (+29 grapple)	43 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Channel Negative Energy (Su) As a standard action,  a hollow serpent can channel negative energy in a 30-foot burst as a 16th-level evil cleric. This ability requires no divine focus. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Desiccation Aura (Su) A cloud of moisture-draining dust fills the air in a 30-foot radius around a hollow serpent. Living creatures within this area must make a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage as water is leached from their flesh. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected again by the same hollow serpent's desiccation aura for 24 hours. Creatures without fleshy bodies are immune to this aura, while creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Life-Draining Coils (Su) A hollow serpent seethes with negative energy capable of sapping the life force of creatures trapped within its coils. Every time a creature takes constriction damage from a hollow serpent, it gains one negative level. The hollow serpent also gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level it bestows.  Lifesense (Su) A hollow serpent notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Swift Strike (Ex) When a hollow serpent takes a full-attack action, it can make two bite attacks instead of just one.																												
Horned Devil	16.00	76800	Large	8	35, touch 17, flat-footed 27	217	18	17	13		27		30 ft., fly 50 ft. (average)	#ERROR!		10 ft.	10 ft.		Str 31, Dex 27, Con 28, Int 14, Wis 22, Cha 23	15	26	44	PFRPG Bestiary	Infernal Wound (Su) The damage a horned devil deals with its tail causes persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is difficult to staunch-a DC 26 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects.  Stun (Su) Whenever a horned devil hits with a spiked chain attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. This ability is a function of the horned devil, not of the spiked chain. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Jade Colossus	16.00	76800	Colossal	0	34, touch 2, flat-footed 34	256	10	10	10	light reflection			40 ft.	2 slams +43 (4d8+19)		30 ft.	30 ft.	breath weapon	Str 49, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	32	59	69	Tome of Horrors Complete	Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a jade colossus can spray a blast of green energy in either a 60-foot cone or a 120-foot line. A creature in the affected area takes 15d6 points of damage, Reflex half DC 26. A creature slain as the result of this breath weapon transforms into jade. The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature turned to jade has Hardness 6, hp 40. This effect can be reversed by casting stone to flesh, wish, or miracle. The victim remains dead, but can then be raised or resurrected normally. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A jade colossus is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A disintegrate spell slows a jade colossus (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A shatter spell deals 3d12 points of damage to a jade colossus, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the jade colossus and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A jade colossus gets no saving throw against fire effects. Light Reflection (Ex) The angles and makeup of the jade colossus allows it to reflect any light-based attacks or effects (it cannot reflect natural sunlight however). Reflected light acts as an emanation (lasting 1 round) that blinds all creatures within 40 feet. A creature can attempt a Reflex save DC 26 to avoid being blinded If the save fails, the creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds (as the blindness spell); creatures that successfully save are instead dazzled for a like amount of time. Undead and similar creatures to whom sunlight is harmful to take 6d6 points of damage (a successful Reflex save DC 26 halves the damage).																												
Juggerloathe	16.00	76800	Gargantuan	5	32, touch 7, flat-footed 31	256	19	14	12		22		40 ft., burrow 30 ft.	2 bites +26 (3d8+11), 2 claws +26 (2d8+11)		20 ft.	20 ft.	devour life, ejection, leaping shockwave, swallow whole (AC 23, hp 30), trample (2d8+11, DC 30)	Str 32, Dex 13, Con 26, Int 5, Wis 19, Cha 12	19	+34 (+36 bull rush)	45 (47 vs. bull rush, 49 vs. trip)	Belkzen Hold Of The Orc Hordes	Devour Life (Su) The Juggerloathe's stomach leeches the life force of those trapped within it, rather than digesting them with acids. Any living victims that are swallowed whole and killed while within the Juggerloathe are turned into twisted creatures of undeath and pain. Regardless of their original size or form, those killed within the Juggerloathe become bodaks (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 48), though their appearance may be less humanoid than those of typical bodaks. These undead stop taking damage while within the Juggerloathe, and escape its innards when it next uses its ejection attack. The undead aren't controlled by the Juggerloathe, but they don't attack it and it is immune to their powers.  Ejection (Ex) The Juggerloathe can eject the contents of its stomach in a 60-foot cone that deals 8d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 27 half) once every 1d6 rounds. Any creatures swallowed whole by it-still living and undead-land prone at the far end of the cone. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Leaping Shockwave (Ex) The Juggerloathe leaps into combat much like normal bulettes, but lands with an earth-shaking impact. When it charges, it can attempt a DC 25 Acrobatics check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it's successful, all adjacent foes must succeed at a DC 30 Reflex save or be knocked prone. The Juggerloathe ends its charge with two bite attacks and two claw attacks, dividing them up as it sees fit among targets within reach. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Kulgreer	16.00	76800	Gargantuan	4	22, touch 6, flat-footed 22	252	16	10	16		27		swim 50 ft.	slam +27 (4d6+18/19-20)		20 ft.	15 ft.	vortex	Str 34, Dex 10, Con 22, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 14	18	34	44 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Vortex (Su) Three times per day, a kulgreer can create a powerful, self-contained whirlpool within its conical frame. This lasts for 1d6+6 rounds. Huge and smaller creatures within 20 feet of the kulgreer must succeed on a DC 34 Swim check or be yanked into the 30-foot diameter mouth of the whirlpool. As the whirlpool spirals through the kulgreer's frame, creatures inside are thrashed violently about taking 2d6+18 points of damage each round. A successful DC 34 Reflex save or DC 34 Swim check negates the damage for that round and allows the trapped creature to escape. The save DCs are Strength-based.  During the final round of the vortex's duration, any creatures still trapped are pulled through the sphere of dim, white light in the kulgreer's tapered outlet. Such creatures must succeed on a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 12d6 points of damage. Those succeeding on their save take only half damage and are forcibly ejected from the kulgreer and flung 40 feet away. There is a 5% chance that any ejected creature is instead sent to a random plane of existence (GM's choice as to which one). The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Labyrinth Minotaur	16.00	76800	Large	4	29, touch 13, flat-footed 29	232	19	9	17	natural cunning			30 ft.	#ERROR!		10 ft.	10 ft.	bronze mask, powerful charge (gore, 2d8+16), steel-shod hooves, trample (2d6+16, DC 28)	Str 33, Dex 19, Con 30, Int 17, Wis 26, Cha 14	15	+27 (+31 bull rush)	41 (43 vs. bull rush)	AP 77	Bronze Mask (Su) A labyrinth minotaur draws agility and ferocity from its bronze mask. When it makes a full-attack action, a labyrinth minotaur wearing its bronze mask can give up its regular attacks and instead make one gore attack or bull rush against each opponent within reach. It must make a separate attack roll against each opponent, and it can't choose to move with targets that are pushed back. A labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. If a labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask is stolen or destroyed, it can create a replacement with 1 week of work.  Natural Cunning (Ex) Like a normal minotaur, a labyrinth minotaur possesses innate cunning and logical ability, granting it immunity to maze spells and preventing it from ever becoming lost. Further, a labyrinth minotaur is never caught flat-footed.  Steel-Shod Hooves (Ex) A labyrinth minotaur's steel-shod hooves are particularly devastating when used to trample an opponent. A creature that takes full damage from a labyrinth minotaur's trample ability (because the creature either failed its Reflex save or chose to take an attack of opportunity instead of attempting a Reflex save) is knocked prone and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equal to that of the labyrinth minotaur's trample ability) reduces the duration of the staggered condition to 1 round.																												
Lilith	16.00	76800	Medium	7	33, touch 24, flat-footed 30	178	10	13	16		27		40 ft., fly 60 ft. (good)	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.		Str 21, Dex 16, Con 21, Int 19, Wis 19, Cha 33	17	22	46	Tome of Horrors Complete	Fear Aura (Su) A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by her fear aura for one day. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Amaheuris: Lilith carries a unique +2 axiomatic unholy longsword. Once per day, she can fire a finger of death (caster level 15th) from her weapon at a single target she can see and that is within 50 feet. A target struck must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or die. Even if the save succeeds, the target takes 3d6+10 points of damage.																												
Mature Adult Gold Dragon	16.00	76800	Huge	0	33, touch 8, flat-footed 33	250	18	12	19		27	vulnerability to cold	60 ft., fly 250 ft.

Detect Gems (Sp) A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones.  Fast Flight (Ex) A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed.  Luck (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.  Weakening Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).																												
Mithral Golem	16.00	76800	Huge	7	32, touch 16, flat-footed 24	172	8	15	8				50 ft.	2 slams +33 (4d10+11)		15 ft.	15 ft.	fluid form, quickness	Str 33, Dex 24, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	24	37	55	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Fluid Form (Ex) A mithral golem's body can take on a form like liquid silver as a swift action. While in this form, the mithral golem's reach increases to 30 feet and its DR becomes 15/bludgeoning and adamantine. A mithral golem in this form can also move through any crack or hole in a wall or door, no matter how small, without impeding its movement. A mithral golem can maintain this form for up to 10 rounds per day, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive. Reverting to its normal form is a free action.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A mithral golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a mithral golem, as noted below.  • A slow spell cast on the golem causes it to lose its quickness ability for 1d6 rounds.  • A haste spell heals the golem of 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum 10d6).  • Hitting a mithral golem in fluid form with any spell of 6th level or higher with the cold descriptor causes the golem to take 10d6 points of damage (no save) and lose the use of its fluid form ability for 24 hours.  Quickness (Ex) A mithral golem is incredibly quick. It can take an extra move action during its turn each round. This means it can move up to its speed and still make a full attack.

Favored Enemy (Ex) A mythic ice devil can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +6 favored enemy bonus against one type of creature for 1 hour, as if it were a 14th-level ranger.  Ice Burrowing (Ex) This ability works like the burrow ability, but only through ice and snow (including magical ice such as a wall of ice).  Ice Shards (Su) A mythic ice devil's ice-tipped spear embeds jagged shards of supernaturally cold ice in its target. This functions as bleed (1d6), except the damage is cold damage. Dealing 5 or more points of fire damage to the target removes all ice shards. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this ability.  Slow (Su) A hit from a mythic ice devil's tail or spear induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds. This effect comes from the devil, not its weapon; it is not a quality possessed by the spear itself. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 26) or be destroyed.  Electricity Aura (Su) An old blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 10 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn.  Mirage (Su) An old blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for 20 rounds per day. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will. Repulsion Breath (Su) Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater. Wave Mastery (Su)For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.

The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the oma, the oma takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this combat maneuver check.  Carrier (Ex) A creature swallowed whole by an oma can forgo attempts to cut itself out and instead attempt a DC 20 Reflex save on its turn. Success allows the creature to move into the creature's larger second stomach, where it can ride safely for an indefinite period without taking damage. When a passenger wishes to leave, it can cut its way free using the normal rules, or attempt an additional DC 20 Reflex save to be safely excreted in a square adjacent to the oma. An oma's carrier stomach can hold up to one Gargantuan creature (or twice as many creatures of the next smallest size: two Huge creatures, four Large, and so on). At its option, an oma can choose to forgo the normal bite damage of swallowing whole, but not the acid damage of the first stomach.  Starflight (Ex) An oma can survive in the void of outer space, and soars through vacuum at incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip between two planets within a solar system should take 3d20 days, while one to another system should take 3d20 weeks (or more, at the GM's discretion), provided the oma knows the way to its destination.

At the start of the ooze's turn as a free action, the ooze makes a combat maneuver check against all metallic creatures, all creatures wearing metal armor, and all creatures wielding metal weapons within 30 feet. If it beats the CMD of a  metal or armored creature with this check, that creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze and cannot move away from the ooze for 1 round. If this causes the creature to move into a square occupied by the plasma ooze, the ooze can attempt to engulf that creature as a free action. If it beats the CMD of a creature wielding a metal weapon, that weapon is disarmed and pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze. Unattended metal objects of size Large or smaller are automatically pulled toward a plasma ooze. This magnetism is supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects.  Plasma Ray (Su) As a standard action, a plasma ooze can fire 1d4 plasma rays at up to 4 separate targets within 60 feet (no more than one ray can attack a single creature). Each ray deals 4d6 points of electricity damage and 4d6 points of fire damage on a hit.

Evil creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Strength Drain (Su) A shemhazian demon deals 2d4 points of Strength drain with each successful bite. A DC 27 Fortitude save reduces this amount to 1d4 points of Strength damage.  The save DC is Constitution-based.

In addition, opponents that successfully strike a slimy demodand with an unarmed strike or natural attack take 2d6 points of acid damage.  Dread Claws (Ex) A slimy demodand adds 1-1/2 times its strength bonus on all attack rolls made when using its claws.

Creatures caught in this cone take 20d6 sonic damage and are permanently deafened. A DC 27 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the deafness. This sonic damage is particularly devastating to constructs-they take a -4 penalty to save against its effects, and if they fail the save, they are staggered for 1d4 rounds as well. The save DC is Constitution-based. Ray Deflection (Su) A spine dragon's scales deflect rays and magic missile spells, rendering the spine dragon immune to such effects. There's a 30% chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster; otherwise, it is simply negated. Spines (Ex) A spine dragon's body is covered with long, crystalline spines. It can fire up to four of these spines per round as a full-attack action (or one as a standard action). A creature that attacks a spine dragon with a melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon must make a DC 20 Reflex save or take 2d8+11 points of piercing damage from the spines. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

A DC 20 Reflex save reduces this damage by half. The blood becomes inert one round after leaving the elemental's body.  Radial Symmetry (Ex) Because of its shape, the stone treant can bring no more than four of its slam attacks to bear on any one target. However, it also perceives the area around it equally well, and thus it cannot be flanked.

Slow Aura (Su) An old or older copper dragon is surrounded by an aura of slowness. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon must make a Will save or be affected as per slow for 1 round. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. For great wyrm copper dragons, those opponents that fail their saves are slowed for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. A copper dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.  Slow Breath (Su) Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.  Trap Master (Ex) A juvenile or older copper dragon receives a +1 bonus per age category on Craft (traps) and Perception checks made to locate a trap. Upon becoming a mature adult, he can also use Disable Device to disarm magic traps as if he had the rogue's Trapfinding class feature.

Trackless Step (Ex) An adult or older green dragon does not leave a trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. A green dragon can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires.  Water Breathing (Ex) A green dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.  Woodland Stride (Ex) A very young or older green dragon can move through any sort of foliage at full speed without taking damage or suffering impairment.

Vilsteth	16.00	76800	Medium	8	30, touch 14, flat-footed 26	225	18	10	14		27		30 ft.	2 claws +24 (2d6+6), gore +24 (2d6+6 plus 1d4 Wis), tail slap +19 (1d8+3)		5 ft.	5 ft.	idolatry, labyrinthine mindtrap, mindrender, powerful charge (gore, 4d6+12), rend (2 claws, 2d6+9), unspeakable truth	Str 22, Dex 19, Con 24, Int 23, Wis 16, Cha 23	18	24	38	AP 77	Idolatry (Su) When a vilsteth uses enter image, meld into stone, possess object, or statue to assume the appearance of a public or religious monument (either by entering or controlling an existing object or by taking the semblance of one), it can make itself an object of worship and adoration. This functions as sympathy (DC 25, CL 18th) upon either a single creature within 30 feet or all creatures of the chosen type or alignment within 30 feet. Any creature that fails its saving throw against this effect must attempt an additional DC 25 Will save after spending 24 hours within 30 feet of the object of worship. If the targeted creature fails this second save, it's affected as if under a permanent mind fog effect with respect to the vilsteth. This is a curse effect and cannot be dispelled (although dispel chaos or dispel evil can remove this effect, as does break enchantment).  Labyrinthine Mindtrap (Su) Whenever a vilsteth is targeted with a divination or mind-affecting effect, including effects that simply facilitate mental communication, the caster's mind is entrapped within the twisted corridors and pathways of the vilsteth's intellect, causing the caster to become dazed (Will DC 25 negates). Each round on the victim's turn, it can attempt a new saving throw to escape this mind trap, ending its turn, but each failed save deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain to the creature. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the same vilsteth's labyrinthine mindtrap for 24 hours.  Mindrender (Su) When a vilsteth hits with both claw attacks and rends its target, it gains a +4 profane bonus on its gore attack for that turn. In addition, if the vilsteth's gore attack hits, the target is affected by the vilsteth's labyrinthine mindtrap ability, even if the targeted creature already successfully saved against that ability in the last 24 hours.  Unspeakable Truth (Su) A vilsteth is surrounded by a mantle of misinformation. Creatures within 30 feet are affected by a curse that manifests the next time they attempt to share information about the vilsteth, including things they have observed the demon saying or doing. This curse affects the creature as fumbletongueUM (Will DC 25 negates). A successful save negates the curse, but if the target fails the save, this curse manifests every time that target attempts to talk about the vilsteth. This curse is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and can't be dispelled or suppressed with protection from evil. A vilsteth can order creatures affected by charm or compulsion effects that it creates to share information about it without triggering the curse.

This immediately kills the creature, absorbs the corpse into the warsworn, and heals the warsworn by an amount equal to the creature's Constitution score. Absorbed corpses can't be resurrected by any effect short of a miracle or wish until the warsworn that consumed them is destroyed.  Profane Magic (Su) Protection from evil blocks attacks from a warsworn's spell-like abilities. Weapons animated by the warsworn are damaged by channeled energy as if undead.  Scrap Ball (Ex) The warsworn can throw a mass of broken weapons and armor. This deals an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + the warsworn's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 feet.

When it uses this ability, the wind yai must make a single bull rush combat maneuver check (CMB equal to the wind yai's caster level + its Cha bonus; +21 for most wind yai) against all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst. Any creature with a CMD score lower than the result of this check is hurled 1d6 x 10 feet straight up, and lands prone in a spot 1d4 x 5 feet from its original position. The wind yai selects the direction it wishes to throw its victims, and may select a different direction for each victim, though each must be thrown in a straight line. Creatures take falling damage for any impacts while traveling up or down in this way; if a creature collides with an object during its sideways movement, both the creature and the object take 1d6 points of damage and the creature is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.  Shocking Missile (Su) As a swift action, a wind yai can fire a bolt of electricity from its third eye as a ranged touch attack. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment, and deals 4d6 points of damage. If the creature struck is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, it instead takes 4d8 points of damage. Upon being struck by this attack, the victim must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A DC 21 Fortitude save negates. The save is Constitution-based. This malady cannot be remedied short of a wish, miracle, or Dobrynya the druid's intervention.  Forest Mastery (Ex) A wood elemental gains a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls if she and her opponent are both in a forested area. This ability has been added in to the above stat block.

Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.

This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does.  Freezing Fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.  Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.

Creatures may attempt a saving throw for half damage. Any creature that fails its save and is touching the ground is entangled for 1d6 rounds by this material. A creature can break free with a DC 28 Strength or Escape Artist check. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Forest Step (Su) A zomok in a forest area may teleport up to 120 feet by moving the essence of its being to another forested area. The zomok is cured of 60 points of damage when it does this. It may use this ability once every 1d6+1 rounds but no more than three times per day. If the zomok has swallowed a foe, the foe is left behind when the zomok teleports.

Such creatures must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. If even one creature is affected, the Abaddon gigas gains fast healing 15 for 15 rounds. If a creature dies from an Abaddon gigas's energy drain special attack, energy drain spell, or devour souls attack, the Abaddon gigas devours that creature's soul, gaining the benefits of death knell at a caster level equal to the dead creature's HD. Such a creature cannot be raised or resurrected by any means until the Abaddon gigas is slain. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Planar Empowerment (Su) While on the plane of Abaddon, an Abaddon gigas can cast each of the following as a spell-like ability once per day: blasphemy (DC 28), earthquake (DC 29), and unholy aura (DC 29) . If the gigas ventures onto another plane, it can't use these abilities (though its other spell-like abilities remain available). The save DCs for these spell-like abilities are Charisma-based and include a +5 racial bonus.  Vile Weapon (Su) As a swift action, an Abaddon gigas can transform its weapon into a +3 wounding adamantine greatsword, a +5 nullifyingUE adamantine spiked gauntlet, a +5 unholy adamantine quarterstaff, a +3 cruelUE keen scythe, or a +3 weapon of any other kind.																												
Abyssal Harvester	17.00	102400	Gargantuan	0	28, touch 6, flat-footed 28	283	16	9	15				20 ft.	6 tentacles +22 (4d6+15/19-20 plus grab)		20 ft.	20 ft.	debilitating constrict, far reaching, harvest	Str 41, Dex 10, Con 29, Int 10, Wis 16, Cha 13	15	+29 (+31 bull rush, +35 grapple)	39 (41 vs. bull rush, grapple can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Debilitating Constriction (Su): An abyssal harvester that has successfully grappled an opponent of its size or smaller deals tentacle damage plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. A creature reduced to Constitution 0 by an abyssal harvester dies. Note, that the abyssal harvester only deals Constitution damage when constricting a foe.  Far Reaching (Su): An abyssal harvester can remain on its abyssal plane and inject up to four of its tentacles across the dimensions and into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, material planes, or Nine Hells. It can do this a total of twelve times per day (so it could inject one tentacle twelve times into any plane, or four tentacles up to three times each).  All of its tentacles must be injected into the same plane, and all appear within the same 20-foot area. While using this abitliy, it uses sensory organs on its tentacles to see, hear, smell, and efel its surroundings. It can attack normally (at its full attack bonus) while using this ability but it cannot move from its current location. It can withdraw its tentacles as a move action and re-inject them into the same plane (or a different plane) on its next turn.  A dismissal, dispel chaos, or dispel evil spell (using the second effect of either spell) causes an abyssal harvester to withdraw a single tentacle (whichever one was touched) if it fails its Wli lsave.  It cannot re-inject that same tentacle into the same plane for one day.  A banishment spell forces an abyssal harvester to withdraw all of its tentacles if it fails its Will save. It cannot re-inject any ten-tacles that were banished into the same plane for one day.  Harvest (Su): This ability can only be used when the abyssal harvester is on its abyssal plane and injects its tentacles into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, a material plane, or the Nine Hells.  A grappled foe with 20 or fewer hit points or 4 or fewer Constitution points must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be drawn through an invisible planar gate (created around the abyssal harvester's tentacles) onto the same plane where the abyssal harvester currently resides. An opponent drawn into the same plane with the harvester is still grappled upon arrival. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Tentacle Regeneration (Ex): An abyssal harvester regrows any lost tentacles in 1 week.

This generates massive waves up to 30 feet tall that may capsize boats and ships within 100 feet of the afanc. Boats and ships less than 20 feet long automatically capsize. Boats over 20 feet long may or may not capsize depending on the skill of the one piloting the vessel. A character steering or guiding a boat or ship over 20 feet long that succeeds on a DC 37 Profession (sailor) check manages to keep the boat afloat; otherwise it capsizes, spilling its contents into the water. The check DC is Strength-based.

Deadly Joke (Sp) Once per day, as a standard action, a great wyrm copper dragon can tell a joke that kills. This affects one target, and functions as power word kill. This is a language-dependent sonic effect. Mass Laughter (Sp) An ancient copper dragon can tell a fantastic joke once per day as a standard action. All creatures within 10 feet per age category must make a Will save or laugh for 1 round per age category, as if affected by hideous laughter. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is equal to a 6th-level spell. Slow Aura (Su) An old or older copper dragon is surrounded by an aura of slowness. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon must make a Will save or be affected as per slow for 1 round. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. For great wyrm copper dragons, those opponents that fail their saves are slowed for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. A copper dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action. Slow Breath (Su) Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A copper dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Very young-grease; Juvenile-hideous laughter; Adult-stone shape; Old-transmute rock to mud/mud to rock; Ancient-wall of stone; Great wyrm-move earth. Trap Master (Ex) A juvenile or older copper dragon receives a +1 bonus per age categroy on Craft (traps) and Perception checks made to locate a trap. Upon becoming a mature adult, he can also use Disable Device to disarm magic traps as if he had the rogue's Trapfinding class feature. Uncanny Dodge (Ex) A young or older copper dragon is always looking out for an ambush. He can never be caught flat-footed. This ability functions like the rogue ability of the same name.

These treants can be called from any Huge or larger living tree. A green dragon can create a single treant as a standard action, up to a total of 4 treants per day. These treants remain animated for up to 1 hour, at which time they revert to being ordinary trees. Camouflage (Ex) An old or older green dragon can use Stealth to hide in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment. Miasma (Su) An ancient or older green dragon can use its breath weapon to create a cloud of acid as a standard action that deals damage to any creature inside it. The cloud moves with the dragon and has a radius of 20 feet. When it's created, anyone inside this area takes an amount of damage equal to half the dragon's breath weapon, with a Reflex save for half damage. The number of damage dice rolled is halved each round until the result would be less than 1d6. Any creature that starts its turn inside the cloud takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. A strong wind, such as that created by a gust of wind, disperses the cloud in 1 round. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A green dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-entangle; Juvenile-charm person; Adult-suggestion; Old-plant growth; Ancient-dominate person; Great wyrm-command plants. Trackless Step (Ex) An adult or older green dragon does not leave a trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. A green dragon can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires. Water Breathing (Ex) A green dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged. Woodland Stride (Ex) A very young or older green dragon can move through any sort of foliage at full speed without taking damage or suffering impairment.

This magma cools instantly-it does not continue doing damage at this point but does entrap the victim (see universal monster rules in appendix; DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC, 3d6 minutes, hardness 8, hp 45).  Magma Breath (Su) Three times per day, an ancient or older magma dragon can breathe a cone of lava instead of fire. The damage is unchanged, but the magma clings to those it damages, dealing half damage each round thereafter for 1d3 rounds. After this magma cools, it crumbles to dust.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A magma dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) on reaching the listed age category. Very young-burning hands; Juvenile-scorching ray; Adult- wall of fire; Old-fire shield (warm shield, constant); Ancient-delayed blast fireball (3/day); Great wyrm-wall of lava*.  Superheated (Su) At young age and older, a magma dragon's bite attack deals additional fire damage equal to its age category.

Sea Strider (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, an old or older sea dragon can move from one body of water to another as if using the teleport spell (self only).  Tidal Wave (Su) Once per day, a great wyrm sea dragon can create a tidal wave. This ability is the same as the bronze dragon's ability of the same name (Bestiary 104).  Torrent Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of super-heated steam, a very young or older sea dragon can breathe a line of pressurized water twice the length of the sea dragon's cone breath weapon. This line deals bludgeoning damage.  Unfettered Swimmer (Su) A juvenile sea dragon gains a 10-foot bonus to its swim speed. The sea dragon's swim speed continues to increase by an additional 10 feet every two age categories. Furthermore, while swimming, the sea dragon is treated as if under the effects of the spell freedom of movement.																												
Apostate Devil	17.00	102400	Medium	14	46, touch 20, flat-footed 36	261	20	16	20		27		30 ft., fly 30 ft. (perfect)	2 claws +28 (1d8+9/19-20 plus 1d6 Wisdom drain)		5 ft.	10 ft.	boundless reach, ohrwurm, summon devil	Str 28, Dex 31, Con 28, Int 21, Wis 24, Cha 28	18	28	47	Book of the Damned V1	Boundless Reach (Su) A deimavigga's claws slice through reality, allowing it to make melee attacks against any creature it is aware of-typically meaning creatures within 100 feet. The devil still only threatens the 10-foot area around it and it cannot make attacks of opportunity against creatures farther away. This ability can span vast distances, allowing a deimavigga making use of divination magic to detect distant creatures and attack foes separated by miles or even planes. Spells like forbiddance, which prevent planar travel, also protect against a deimavigga's claws. The spell dimensional anchor also prevents a deimavigga from using this ability for the duration of that spell. An attacked creature can retaliate that round, striking at the devil's claws with weapons or spells as if its entire body were present, but cannot grapple or otherwise prevent the claws from vanishing out of reach at the end of the round. Evangelization (Su) The words of deimaviggas are poison to the mind. Every round a deimavigga speaks (a free action), all non-devils with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 30 feet must make a DC 28 Will save or become vulnerable to its blasphemous discourse. The DC of this Will save increases by +1 for each consecutive round a creature has listened to the same deimavigga speak. Creatures must be listening to a deimavigga to be affected by its oration. Deafened creatures and those in combat-either with the deimavigga or other creatures-are not considered to be listening. Victims cannot simply declare they are not listening without taking steps to impede their hearing. Upon failing this save, a victim can be affected by the heretical power of a deimavigga's words. The devil may use its speech to affect a listener in ways that mimic any of the following spells: calm emotions (DC 21), charm monster (DC 23), command (DC 20), confusion (DC 23), crushing despair (DC 23), deep slumber (DC 22), enthrall (DC 21), modify memory (DC 23), rage (DC 22), or suggestion (DC 22). Victims still receive saving throws against these spell effects, but if they fail their saves they are not aware the devil is working its power upon them. A deimavigga can affect multiple victims with different spell effects in the same round. A creature that makes its save against this ability is immune to that particular devil's evangelization for the next 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The base save DC is Charisma-based. Indomitable Oration (Su) A deimavigga's speech is always perfectly clear and cannot be silenced or warped. In areas of incredible noise, through water or airless voids, even in areas of magical silence, these devil's voices can still be heard normally. All beings understand deimaviggas, as if these devils constantly spoke in all tongues at once. Malleable Form (Su) A deimavigga has complete control over its physical form, and if transformed into another shape against its will, it can revert to its own form as a free action. Ohrwurm (Ex) As a standard action, three times per day, a deimavigga can whisper a fundamental and terrifying multiversal truth to one creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 28 Will save or have the devil's words take root in its psyche. Outsiders and elementals have a +2 bonus on their saves to resist this ability. Initially, the deimavigga's words seem to have no effect. Anytime the victim tries to rest, though, he must make an additional DC 28 Will save or be affected as per the spell nightmare (even if the victim doesn't technically sleep). After a night of suffering vivid dreams and wrestling with the devil's words, the victim must make yet another DC 28 Will save or have its alignment shift one step toward lawful evil. Only by unlearning what the deimavigga told it can a victim be free of this effect, requiring a spell such as miracle, modify memory, or wish. Summon Devil (Sp) Once per day a deimavigga can attempt to summon 1d6 osyluths or 2d4 barbazu with a 50% chance of success, or 1 gelugon with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. Wisdom Drain (Su) A deimavigga drains 1d6 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its claw attack. (A deimavigga does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.)																												
Aspidochelone	17.00	102400	Colossal	-3	27, touch -1, flat-footed 27	297	23	10	7				0 ft., swim 120 ft.	bite +25 (4d6+11 plus grab), tail slap +20 (4d6+5)		150 ft.	20 ft.	capsize, swallow whole (4d6 acid damage, AC 24, 29 hp), watery grave	Str 32, Dex 5, Con 27, Int 3, Wis 7, Cha 12	22	41	48	AP 27	Capsize (Ex) A aspidochelone can attempt to capsize a boat or ship of Gargantuan size or smaller by merely passing through its space and making a CMB check as a free action. The DC the aspidochelone must exceed is 25, or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. Captivating Scent (Ex) An aspidochelone exudes intoxicating pheromones from its skin, causing nearby creatures to seek it out. Anyone within a 1-mile radius must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or feel inexplicably drawn toward the aspidochelone by the most direct route possible. This effect is not an overwhelming compulsion, but more a subtle suggestion. The save DC is Charisma-based with a -10 penalty. Deep Sea Denizen (Ex) An aspidochelone can travel to extraordinary depths, and has adapted to the intense darkness and water pressure of the deep. It possesses darkvision with a range of 120 ft. and is immune to damage from water pressure. Hibernate (Ex) After gorging itself on innumerable tons of deep sea life and unfortunate travelers, an aspidochelone floats to the surface and goes into a deep hibernation with only its mottled back jutting from the waves. While hibernating, it appears to be little more than a rocky outcropping or, in the cases of the largest aspidochelone, an entire island. A hibernating aspidochelone is considered to have taken 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a rock or island. An aspidochelone rouses from its hibernation for one of two reasons: hunger or disturbance. After entering its hibernation, a aspidochelone sleeps for 2d10x10 years, rousing naturally after this time has elapsed. An aspidochelone about to awaken usually sleeps fitfully for the last year of its rest, quivering with tremors that feel like earthquakes to creatures upon it. These tremors are treated as a minor version of the earthquake spell that affects the entire island, forcing creatures on the ground to make a DC 29 Reflex save to avoid falling down and causing 30 points of damage to all structures. An aspidochelone might be awakened immediately if it takes 100 or more points of damage in a single day. If awakened in this manner, an aspidochelone typically dives to escape its attacker, then rises again to consume it. The save DC is Constituiton-based. Hibernation of Ages (Ex) An aspidochelone in hibernation continues to exude its captivating scent. Over time, birds attracted by the aspidochelone's pheromones come to roost on the whale, inadvertently bringing the seeds of small plants and shrubbery to grow in the cracks upon the aspidochelone's thick hide. The preponderance of plants, seabirds, and even other beasts gives the creature the appearance of a rocky but natural island. Thus, any aspidochelone who has spent more than 10 years hibernating gains an addition +10 bonus on its Stealth check to look like a natural island. Watery Grave (Ex) A startled aspidochelone descends rapidly into the depths of the sea, creating an undertow in the water that pulls creatures above the whale down with it. Anyone standing on or swimming within 100 feet of the aspidochelone when it dives must make a DC 29 Reflex save or take 10d6 points of damage from the crushing waves and pressure, and be pulled 100 feet below the water. Even if a creature escapes the undertow, the water within 100 feet of a passing aspidochelone is treated as rough water, requiring a DC 20 Swim check to move at half speed. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Living creatures within a 120- foot radius of a singing bakekujira must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or become fascinated or frightened (bakekujira's choice) for 1 round. Any creature that succeeds at this save cannot be affected by the same bakekujira's leviathan's call ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Resonant Song (Su) As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, the bakekujira can release a damaging resonance, dealing 12d8 points of sonic damage to creatures in a 60-foot cone (Fortitude DC 28 for half). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Smashing Breach (Ex) As a full-round action, a swimming bakekujira can make a special charge attack against a creature on the water's surface. At the end of its charge, the whale breaches, slamming down with incredible force. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the bakekujira's space must succeed at a DC 28 Reflex save or take 4d8+24 points of bludgeoning damage and be forced into the nearest empty square adjacent to the bakekujira. Humanoid creatures killed by this ability rise as draugr (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 110) in 1d6 hours. A bakekujira can use its capsize special attack in conjunction with this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Undead Parasites (Su) A 30-foot-radius cloud of undead fish and sea birds surrounds a bakekujira. Creatures starting their turn within the cloud must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be nauseated for 1 round and take 6d6 points of damage. Creatures with the ability to channel positive energy can suppress this aura for 1 round by expending one use of channel energy. The bakekujira receives a Will save against this effect. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the channeler's caster level + the channeler's Charisma modifier. The channeled energy has no other effect.																												
Bandersnatch	17.00	102400	Gargantuan	11	33, touch 13, flat-footed 26	310	21	20	11	quick recovery, quill defense			60 ft., climb 20 ft.	bite +32 (2d8+13 plus grab), 2 claws +32 (2d6+13/19-20), tail slap +27 (2d8+19/3 plus pain)	4 quills +26 (1d10+13/19-20)	20 ft.	15 ft. (20 ft. with tail slap)	bounding charge, brutal tail, gaze, lash out, pounce, rake (4 claws, +32, 2d6+13/19-20), rend (2 claws, 2d6+19)	Str 36, Dex 25, Con 27, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 18	23	+40 (+44 grapple)	57 (65 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Bounding Charge (Ex) A bandersnatch can move through difficult terrain when it charges.  Brutal Tail (Ex) The quills and barbs on a bandersnatch's tail cause triple damage on a critical hit from its tail slap. A bandersnatch adds 1-1/2 times its strength bonus on attack rolls when using its tail slap.  Gaze (Su) Confused for 1 round, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 29 negates. A bandersnatch can direct its gaze attack against a single foe as a swift action. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Lash Out (Ex) As a swift action, a bandersnatch can make a single attack with a bite, claw, or tail slap. A bandersnatch cannot lash out on the same round it charges.  Pain (Ex) Whenever a creature takes damage from a bandersnatch's tail slap attack, quills, or quill defense, that creature must make a DC 28 Reflex save or a quill lodges in its flesh, causing the creature to become sickened until the quill is removed. Removing one quill requires a DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process deals 1d10+6 points of damage to the victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Planar Acclimation (Ex) A bandersnatch is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.  Quill Defense (Ex) Any creature that strikes a bandersnatch with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon takes 1d10 points of piercing damage from the bandersnatch's quills and suffers from the bandersnatch's pain attack.  Quick Recovery (Su) A debilitated bandersnatch recovers with frightening speed. If a bandersnatch starts its turn affected by any or all of the following conditions, these conditions end at the end of its turn: confused, dazed, dazzled, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and stunned. Furthermore, a bandersnatch affected by ability damage, ability drain, or a mind-affecting effect that allows a save receives a single additional save against the effect of its choice at the original DC at the end of its turn in order to shake off the effect.  Quills (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a bandersnatch can loose a volley of four quills as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 300 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. Launched quills regrow in a single round, during which the bandersnatch's defensive abilities are unaffected.  Relentless Tracker (Ex) A bandersnatch can move at up to double its speed and still track without penalty. It gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track creatures it has wounded.																												
Behemoth Golem	17.00	102400	Colossal	-1	31, touch 1, flat-footed 31	206	7	6	9				30 ft.	gore +31 (4d8+16), 2 slams +31 (3d6+16)		30 ft.	30 ft.	quake, trample (3d6+24, DC 37)	Str 42, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 15, Cha 1	23	47	56 (60 vs. trip)	Lost Kingdoms	Castle (Ex) A behemoth golem has a small stronghold built onto its back. Up to eight Medium creatures can occupy this tower by climbing onto the behemoth golem with a DC 25 Climb check (DC 10 if the golem is willing). A creature occupying the tower can choose either to hide in the castle's interior, gaining total cover as long as it remains within the structure but losing the ability to attack anything outside of the tower, or to stand on the parapet around the perimeter of the tower, gaining partial cover thanks to the battlement surrounding the walkway. A behemoth golem's castle moves with the creature itself, and though creatures occupying the castle count as occupying the same square as the golem, they cannot be engaged in melee unless their opponent is also occupying the castle.  A behemoth golem can shake off unwanted occupants by making a combat maneuver check as a full-round action; any creatures currently occupying the castle must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the result of the behemoth golem's combat maneuver check). Creatures standing on the parapet that fail their save fall out of the castle, landing in the nearest empty square and taking 5d6 points of falling damage (6d6 if standing on the uppermost parapet); creatures hiding within the castle that fail their saves are jumbled about and take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC for half damage).  Immunity to Magic (Su) A behemoth golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature.  • A stone to flesh spell negates a behemoth golem's damage reduction for 1 round.  • A transmute rock to mud spell slows a behemoth golem as the slow spell for 1d4 rounds (no save).  • A magical attack that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A behemoth golem gets no save against acid effects.  Quake (Su) As a standard action once per day, a behemoth golem can stomp its two front feet down, creating a ripple of destruction in a 60-foot cone. This effect is otherwise identical to earthquake (caster level 17th).

This breath weapon has a range of 900 feet, and creates a 40-foot-diameter spread of slime in its targeted area. Any creature within this area must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The slime transforms the area it coats into difficult terrain. Furthermore, any creature that is in the area (or that attempts to enter the area) must succeed at a DC 29 Reflex save or be entangled by the slime. Bhole slime persists for 2d6 hours and bhole lairs are typically pre-caked with the stuff. A bhole can move through bhole slime without penalty. The save DC is Constitution-based.   Immune to Magical Control (Ex) A bhole is immune to nearly all forms of mind control, including all charm, suggestion, and dominate spells. It is similarly immune to magic jar and possession attempts. Confusion and other mind-affecting effects that don't allow another creature to directly control a bhole work normally. Rare effects that allow a creature to manipulate the exact effects of confusion on a creature provide one of the few ways to magically control a bhole. Other methods, particularly those tied to strange and powerful artifacts, may work as well.  Overwhelming Strength (Ex) A bhole always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on all natural weapon attacks.

Anyone striking a brijidine with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a brijidine or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists.  Heat Stone (Su) Whenever a brijidine uses her meld into stone, soften earth and stone, spike stones, stone shape, or wall of stone spell-like abilities, she can have the affected stone radiate intense heat for 1 minute. Any creature within 5 feet of the stone takes 1d6 fire damage per round.  Lava Blast (Su) A brijidine can hurl a glob of lava at a target as a standard action. This attack has a range increment of 30 feet.  Obsidian Blade (Ex) At will as a free action, a brijidine can create a blade of jagged volcanic glass that functions as a +1 flaming burst keen longsword. One round after it leaves the brijidine's grasp, the weapon decays into useless powder.

Stagger (Ex) Any creature that takes damage from a cervinal's powerful charge attack must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Dancing Hut Of Baba Yaga	17.00	102400	Huge	12	34, touch 20, flat-footed 22	188	9	21	6	evasion, immortal structure	28		60 ft.	2 claws +38 (2d6+13 plus grab), slam +38 (2d8+13 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft.	constrict (2d6+19), fast swallowB3, swallow whole (see below), trample (2d8+19, DC 36)	Str 37, Dex 34, Con -, Int -, Wis 27, Cha 25	27	6	21	Artifacts & Legends	Immortal Structure (Ex) Reducing the Dancing Hut to 0 hit points causes its legs to buckle, bringing the hut itself toppling to the ground. Such a defeat has no effect on the hut's extradimensional interior or any creatures inside the hut. The hut remains immobile and unresponsive to its owner's commands to move or use any of the special abilities described in its creature stat block for 24 hours, though the transportive abilities of the hut and its cauldron can still be employed. The hut cannot be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, no matter what damage, circumstances, or environment it might be subjected to after its defeat. After 24 hours, the hut regains half its hit points (94 hp) and its fast healing ability reactivates. It may then use its special abilities to escape from nearly any situation it finds itself in. The Dancing Hut can only be destroyed by the method detailed in the artifact's destruction entry.  Swallow Whole (Ex) If the Dancing Hut successfully grapples a creature with its slam attack, the victim is scooped up by the hut's front door and flung inside. The target appears within the extradimensional space inside the hut-the layout of which depends upon the hut's physical location (see the map on page 23 for a sample layout of the hut's interior). Being inside the hut is not necessarily dangerous, unless one of Baba Yaga's guardians is there or Baby Yaga herself is home. A swallowed creature can attempt to escape by breaking open the front door, a deceptively sturdy barrier with hardness 15 and 100 hit points that also benefits from the hut's fast healing ability. The hut can expel swallowed creatures as a full-round action, flinging them from its open door. It must make a combat maneuver check against creatures that don't wish to leave, with failure meaning the target is able to hold on to the pitching and warping interior. The hut may choose which creatures it wishes to expel and which to keep inside.

Pound (Ex) A ferrous giant that successfully grabs a foe two or more sizes smaller than itself can smash the opponent into the ground, walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as a standard action. This deals 2d6+22 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent must make a successful DC 37 Fortitude save or be stunned for one round. A ferrous giant can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based. Oversized Weapon Use (Ex) A ferrous giant wields a Gargantuan greatsword or greataxe without penalty. Weapon and Armor Proficiency (Ex) Ferrous giants are automatically proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields.

Those formians are affected as if by a haste spell (CL 20th).  Telepathic Feedback (Su) As a standard action, a queen can unleash debilitating telepathic feedback. Those within her telepathic range who are not members of her hive must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds at the save cannot be affected by telepathic feedback for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Spew Acid (Ex) A gelatinous emperor can, as a standard action, spew forth acid in a 30-foot line at a single target. A creature struck takes 12d6 points of acid damage. A DC 28 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Once a gelatinous emperor has spewed acid, it cannot do so again for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The freezing ooze clings to those struck, and 1 round later the ooze hardens into thick sheets of ice. Creatures that were damaged are frozen motionless unless they can break free with a DC 25 Strength, Escape Artist, or combat maneuver check. Each round a creature remains frozen it takes 1d6 points of cold damage.  Another creature can free a frozen target by tearing away the ice (this takes 1d4 rounds) or dealing at least 20 points of fire damage to the frozen target. Left unattended, the ice crumbles away in 2d4 rounds on its own. Creatures with the fire subtype cannot be frozen in place by this breath weapon. Flying creatures that don't have supernatural flight fall if frozen, and swimming creatures that are frozen rise toward the surface of the water at a speed of 60 feetper round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Death Curse (Su) When a creature slays an ice linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse of frost.  Curse of Frost: save Will DC 25; effect creature gains vulnerability to cold. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Freedom of Movement (Ex) An ice linnorm is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as per the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.  Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 4d6 cold damage and 1d6 Con drain; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  True Seeing (Ex) An ice linnorm has true seeing, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.

When a charmed creature's Wisdom damage equals its Wisdom score, it becomes completely subservient to the immortal ichor (as dominate monster, except it even obeys self-destructive orders) and loses the Wisdom damage it has taken from this ability. A subservient ally who is killed rises the next round as a juju zombie under the immortal ichor's control. If the ichor is killed, these zombies are immediately destroyed.

An irminsul controls whether or not specific creatures can pass through its portal, which grants entrance to a specific location on the linked plane. Those attempting to breach a barred portal must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or be ejected and teleported to a random location on the current plane. If the trespasser successfully saves, it takes 6d6 points of damage and is sickened for 1 minute. The DC for this save is Wisdom-based. Mythic characters can expend uses of mythic power to forcefully pass through the gate, lowering the DC of the saving throw by 5 for each use of mythic power expended in this fashion.

The save DC is Strength-based and is a function of the jack-in-irons not its weapon(s).  Pound (Ex) A jack-in-irons that makes a successful grapple check against a foe two or more sizes smaller than itself can smash the opponent into the ground, walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as a standard action. This deals 2d6+19 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent must succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude save or be stunned for one round. A jack-in-irons can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.  Shake the Earth (Ex) As a standard action, a jack-in-irons can stomp its foot on the ground causing powerful vibrations to radiate out around the giant. Any creature within 5 feet of the jack-in-irons must succeed on a DC 36 Reflex save or fall prone. The save DC is Strength-based.

In addition, a creature struck with this ability is rendered permanently deaf. A creature that makes a successful DC 27 Reflex save takes half damage and avoids the deafening effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Storm Ward (Su) A kaminari treats a specific mass of transient  storm clouds as its ward. This storm is about 1 mile in diameter, and a kaminari can observe the world from any point within its storm ward, whether merged with it or in its physical form. A kaminari can only control the movement of its ward to a minimal extent, willing it to remain in one place or move in a cardinal direction for up to 2d4 hours every day. After this time, the ward continues on its natural course for 24 hours, after which the kaminari may will it to remain stationary again. When a kaminari is in its physical form and within its ward or within 120 feet of its ward's boundaries, it gains the power to call down bolts of lightning. The kaminari can call up to a total of 15 bolts of lightning each day, each of which deals 5d10 points of electricity damage. This ability is otherwise identical to call lightning storm.  Vulnerable to Silence (Su) A kaminari constantly surrounds itself with sound and music, and can't stand any form of silence. Whenever a kaminari is affected by a silence spell or effect or is rendered deaf by any means, it loses its cacophonous blow ability and its fast healing for the duration of the effect. But because a kaminari possesses incredible resilience to such effects, any silence or deafening effect lasts only 2d4 rounds or as long as the effect's duration states, whichever is shorter.

A creature that interacts with reshaped reality may make a DC 26 Will save to see through the semi-real illusion. Terrain can provide concealment, and against foes who do not make the Will save to see through the facade, reshaped reality can provide cover. For disbelievers, quasi-real objects and terrain have only 20% normal hardness and hit points, and break DCs are 10 lower than normal. Dangerous terrain cannot exceed 5d6 points of damage per round (1d6 per round against disbelievers). This ability cannot damage existing structures, nor does it function in areas where planar travel is prohibited.  Spatial Riptide (Su) Any non-protean teleporting into or out of the protean's aura must make a DC 28 Fortitude save or enter a state of suspended animation (identical to temporal stasis) for 1d3 rounds; success means the creature is merely nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Warpwave (Su) A creature struck by a keketar's claw or bite must make a DC 28 Fortitude save or be affected by a warpwave. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Even if this save is successful, the target must succeed at a second save (Fortitude DC 27) or be encased in ice. A trapped creature must succeed at a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 26 Escape Artist check to break free. Attempting to break free of the ice is a full-round action.  Disease (Su) A target bitten by a khala must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or contract chillbane fever.  Chillbane Fever: disease-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage and target is sickened and fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Tenacious Grapple (Ex) A khala does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with its tail.																												
Lilitu	17.00	102400	Medium	9	34, touch 24, flat-footed 28	263	19	23	20	evasion, profane grace	28		60 ft., fly 60 ft. (good)	4 claws +25 (2d8+8/19-20), tail slap +20 touch (1d6+4 plus branding)		5 ft.	5 ft.	create husk, husk link, profane pact, swift claws	Str 27, Dex 20, Con 30, Int 21, Wis 23, Cha 26	17	25	49	The Worldwound	Branding (Su) Each time a lilitu damages a living creature with her tail slap, the wound leaves an angry and permanent red brand. In addition, the creature struck becomes staggered for 1 round from the pain. A successful DC 26 Will save negates the staggered condition and reduces the duration of the brand from permanent to 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based. Removing brands is difficult-each casting of restoration, dispel chaos, or dispel evil removes 1 brand. Heal removes 1d4+4 brands. Greater restoration removes a number of brands equal to the spell's caster level. Miracle and wish can remove all brands at once. The number of brands a creature gains in this manner has a cumulative series of effects, as summarized below.  1-3 Brands: The lilitu can affect the branded creature with its create husk, husk link, and profane pact abilities.  4-6 Bands: The branded creature takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves made against a lilitu's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The branded creature's aura now radiates chaos and evil.  7-9 Brands: The branded creature's Wisdom score is reduced by 4. A chaotic evil creature is immune to this effect.  10 or more Brands: The penalties to the creature's Will saves and Wisdom score listed above double. In addition, the branded creature automatically fails all Will saves made against a lilitu's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A chaotic evil creature is immune to this effect.  Create Husk (Su) Once per day as a swift action, when a lilitu deals enough damage with a weapon, spell, or spell-like ability to kill a humanoid within 30 feet, she can instead opt to transform that slain humanoid into a husk. A successful DC 26 Fortitude save negates this effect, allowing the victim to die normally. A humanoid transformed into a husk withers away into an immobile and desiccated corpse, but does not actually die-in this state, the creature remains aware of its surroundings but can take no actions at all. A husk is essentially treated as an object with hardness 15 and 60 hit points. If a husk is destroyed, the effect ends and the body dies. This is a curse effect- removing this curse restores the victim to life at a number of negative hit points equal to the creature's Constitution -1; a husk restored to life in this way has 1 round to stabilize or be saved before it dies. A lilitu can maintain a number of husks simultaneously equal to her Charisma modifier (8 husks for the typical lilitu); if she creates one too many husks, a previously created husk is released and immediately dies. Lilitus hide their husk collections in very safe places. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Husk Link (Su) By spending a minute in blasphemous contact with a husk she created, a lilitu can establish a supernatural link to that husk. As long as she and that husk remain on the same plane, divination spells reveal the linked husk's alignment to be the same as the lilitu's alignment (chaotic evil). The husk link allows a lilitu to use her change self ability to assume a husk's original form-when she does, she gains a +20 bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate that person. If a lilitu with an active husk link ever takes enough damage to be slain, the husk takes the killing-blow's damage instead and is destroyed, instantly severing the active husk link; if the lilitu is disguised in the husk's original form, she instantly reverts to her true form.  Profane Grace (Su) A lilitu gains a +4 profane bonus to AC and on Initiative checks and Reflex saves.  Profane Pact (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a lilitu may forge a profane pact with a willing humanoid creature bearing at least one lilitu brand by touching the creature for 1 full round. A single creature may have no more than one profane pact from a lilitu at one time. This functions identically to a succubus's profane gift ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 68), save that it grants a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of the humanoid's choice, and it does not grant a telepathic link to the target.  Profane Wishcraft (Su) A creature that accepts a wish from a lilitu immediately becomes chaotic evil unless it makes a successful DC 26 Will save. A creature that becomes chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a good hope spell for 24 hours, followed by the effects of crushing despair for 1d6 days (these spell effects function at CL 17th). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Swift Claws (Ex) When a lilitu makes a full-round attack action, she can attack twice with each of her claws, for a total of four attacks a round.

Lusca Venom: Constrict-injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Rend Ship (Ex) As a full-round action, a lusca can attempt to use four of its tentacles to grapple a ship of its size or smaller by making a combat maneuver check opposed by the ship's captain's Profession (sailor) check; the lusca receives a cumulative +4 bonus on the check for each size category smaller than Gargantuan the ship is. If the lusca grapples the ship, it holds the ship motionless; it can attack targets anywhere on or within the ship with its tentacles, but can't attack foes at all with its shark heads. Each round it maintains its hold on the ship, it automatically deals bite damage to the ship's hull.  Tenacious Grapple (Ex) A lusca does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with its tentacles.

The save DC is Strength-based. Infuse Weapon (Su) Any weapon a marilith wields gains a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage, and strikes as if it were a chaotic and evil cold iron weapon (in addition to retaining the qualities of its actual composition). Multiweapon Mastery (Ex) A marilith never takes penalties to her attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons.

Desert Thirst (Su) A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL equals its HD). Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Dust Cloud (Ex) Sand and dust swirls around a mythic blue dragon's body, attracted by its natural electrical charge. This provides the dragon with concealment but doesn't interfere with the dragon's senses or attacks in any way.  Persuasive Whisper (Sp) A mythic blue dragon can expend one use of mythic power to use charm person or suggestion. Its caster level for these abilities is equal to its Hit Dice.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.

Touch of Chaos (Sp) This functions like the Chaos domain granted power (Core Rulebook 42), except the demon can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to use this ability when it hits with a natural attack.  Unholy Nimbus (Su) Three times per day as a free action, the demon can create writhing colored lights on its body. One round later, the light bursts in a 60-foot radius. Any non-demon caught within this area must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of madness hound it. The save DC is Charisma-based.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6.  Manipulate Flames (Su) An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires.  Smoke Vision (Ex) A very young red dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics).

Ghost Bane (Su)A young or older umbral dragon's physical attacks deal damage to incorporeal creatures normally. Shadow Breath (Su)Three times per day, an adult or older umbral dragon can breathe a cone of shadows. Creatures who fail a Fortitude save are blinded for 1d4 rounds and take 1 point of Str drain per age category possessed by the dragon. A successful save negates the blindness and reduces Str drain to 1d4 points. Umbral Scion (Ex)Umbral dragons have negative energy affinity and are immune to energy drain and death effects.

Any creature that does not succeed at a DC 27 Will save takes 1d6 points of Charisma drain and becomes shaken for 2d4 rounds; in addition, the phasmadaemon gains 5 temporary hit points for every point of Charisma drain dealt this way. If the creature being grappled is already panicked at the beginning of the phasmadaemon's turn, it must save instead on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be slain instantly by the phasmadaemon, which gains a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks for every 2 points of Charisma its victim had before dying; the profane bonuses last for 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Tangible Horror (Su) A phasmadaemon's illusion abilities are partially real at a level above and beyond those normally conjured forth by similar illusion spells. If a creature succeeds at its Will save to disbelieve either a phasmadaemon's greater shadow conjuration or greater shadow evocation spell-like ability, the conjured or evoked spell has 80% the normal effect or is 80% likely to occur, rather than 60%.																												
Royal Time Elemental	17.00	102400	Large	9	27, touch 21, flat-footed 21	228	14	21	22	foresight	28		fly 20 ft. (perfect)	2 slams +28 (2d6+4 plus cell death)		10 ft.	10 ft.	alter age 2/day (Fort DC 26), multi-manifestation, temporal displacement 3/day (24 minutes, Fort DC 26)	Str 18, Dex 20, Con 18, Int 22, Wis 22, Cha 20	24	29	51	Tome of Horrors Complete	Alter Age (Su) Once per day, a noble time elemental can age a creature simply by touching it (this requires a melee touch attack). If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack. An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age. A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger). Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day. Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell. Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common). Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spell-like abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time. Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all. Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell. Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day. Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based. Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD).

Runes (Ex) As a free action, whenever a rune giant uses its spark shower or spell-like abilities, it can cause the runes on its body to flash with light. All creatures within 10 feet of the giant must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw is Charisma-based.  Spark Shower (Su) As a standard action, a rune giant can cause a shower of sparks to erupt out of one of the runes on its body. These sparks function as a breath weapon (30-ft.  cone; 10d6 fire and 10d6 electricity damage; Reflex DC 29 half; usable once every 1d4 rounds). The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Shinigami	17.00	102400	Large	9	31, touch 15, flat-footed 25	275	20	12	19		28		30 ft., fly 40 ft.

These gems are only useful to the shinigami that owns them, and if the shinigami dies, the gems are destroyed as well. As a standard action once per day, a shinigami can hold up a gem that currently contains a soul and crush it, permanently destroying the soul within and releasing a 30-foot-radius burst of negative energy that inflicts 1d6 negative levels on all creatures in the area of effect. A successful DC 30 Fortitude save reduces this to 1 negative level. The soul destroyed in the process of using this ability can only be brought back to life by means of a miracle or wish spell. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Flux infusion functions as a poison, but with unpredictable effects. Those who fail their saving throws take 1d4 points of ability drain. The ability score drained is randomly determined every time the flux infusion affects the creature (roll 1d6: 1-2 Constitution, 3-4 Dexterity, 5-6 Strength). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Flux Infusion: Injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d4 Con, Dex, or Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Rupture (Su) When killed, a termagant explodes in a blast of its flux infusion poison. All living creatures within 15 feet must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude saving throw or be poisoned. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Shared Rupture (Su) Any creature killed while poisoned by a termagant explodes. All living creatures within 10 feet of the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be poisoned. The save DC is based on the termagant's Constitution with a -5 penalty.  Unnerving Gaze (Su) A creature that succumbs to a termagant's unnerving gaze becomes nauseated for 1d4 rounds as its mind attempts to comprehend the horrors it has witnessed.

As a standard action, it can cause these chains to snake outward to a radius of 30 feet. All creatures in this area take 10d6 points of slashing damage and become entangled-a DC 20 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled condition. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Reflex save or a DC 30 Escape Artist check made as a full- round action. The chains can also be sundered (hardness 10, hp 20, Break DC 28). The thrasfyr creates these chains from its own body-destroyed chains regrow in 24 hours.  The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Master's Bond (Su) A thrasfyr can form a bond with a willing creature by touching that creature. This allows the thrasfyr to communicate telepathically with the bonded creature with no range restriction (provided the thrasfyr and its master are on the same plane). Both thrasfyr and master can sense the other's condition as if both were under the effect of a status spell. A thrasfyr can maintain a bond with only one master at a time.  Planar Acclimation (Ex) A thrasfyr is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.

Electricity Aura (Su) A very old blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 10 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn.  Mirage (Su) A very old blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for 22 rounds per day. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will.  Repulsion Breath (Su) Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.  Wave Mastery (Su) For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.																												
Wendigo	17.00	102400	Large	13	32, touch 18, flat-footed 23	279	21	22	11		28	vulnerability to fire	fly 120 ft.

Howl (Ex) Three times per day as a standard action, a wendigo can emit a forlorn howl that can be heard up to a mile away. Any who hear the howl must make a DC 28 Will save to avoid becoming shaken for an hour. Creatures within 120 feet become panicked for 1d4+4 rounds, and those within 30 feet cower with fear for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Wendigo Psychosis (Su) Curse-Nightmare or wind walk; save Will DC 26; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Wis drain (minimum Wis 1); cure 3 consecutive saves. When a victim's Wisdom reaches 1, he seeks an individual of his race to kill and devour. After completing this act, the afflicted individual takes off at a run, and in 1d4 rounds sprints up into the sky at such a speed that his feet burn away into jagged stumps. The transformation into a wendigo takes 2d6 minutes as the victim wind walks across the sky. Once the transformation is complete, the victim is effectively dead, replaced by a new wendigo. True resurrection, miracle, or wish can restore such a victim to life, yet doing so does not harm the new wendigo. The save is Charisma-based.  Wind Walk (Sp) If a wendigo pins a grappled foe, it can attempt to wind walk with the target by using its spell-like ability-it automatically succeeds on all concentration checks made to use wind walk. If the victim fails to resist the spell, the wendigo hurtles into the sky with him. Each round, a victim can make a new DC 23 Will save to turn solid again, but at this point he falls if he cannot fly. Eventually, the wendigo strands the victim in some rural area, usually miles from where it began. A creature that wind walks with a wendigo is exposed to wendigo psychosis. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Any creatures within this area during the winterwight's turn takes 2d10 points of cold damage. All creatures of the cold subtype within this area (including the winterwight) are treated as having fast healing 10.  Blightfire (Su) Whenever a winterwight damages a creature with a bite or claw, the wound erupts with tongues of black fire. For the next 5 rounds, the victim must make a DC 29 Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. The winterwight gains 10 temporary hit points each time the creature fails a saving throw against blightfire. A creature cannot be affected by more than one instance of blightfire at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Wyrm Black Dragon	17.00	102400	Huge	3	40, touch 7, flat-footed 40	324	21	13	19		28		60 ft., fly 200 ft. (poor), swim 60 ft.	bite +35 (2d8+18 plus 4d6 acid), 2 claws +34 (2d6+12), 2 wings +32 (1d8+6), tail slap +32 (2d6+18)		15 ft.	10 ft. (15 ft. with bite)	acid pool (55-ft. radius), acidic bite, breath weapon (100-ft. line, DC 29, 22d6 acid), corrupt water, crush (Small creatures, DC 29, 2d8+18)	Str 35, Dex 8, Con 25, Int 18, Wis 21, Cha 18	24	38	47 (51 vs. trip)	d20pfsrd	Acid Pool (Su) An ancient or older black dragon can use its breath weapon to create an acid pool as a standard action. This acid pool has a radius of 55 feet. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes 22d6 points of acid damage (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the total damage dice of the pool is halved (10d6 round 2, 5d6 round 3, 2d6 round 4, 1d6 round 5) until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface. Acidic Bite (Su) At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence. Crush (Ex) A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus. Speak with Reptiles (Sp) A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals. Swamp Stride (Ex) A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. Water Breathing (Ex) A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

This functions as gust of wind, but any creature in its path must make a Fortitude save (DC 29) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand.  Fire Aura (Su) An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient brass dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A brass dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.  Move Sand (Su) A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell.  Sandstorm (Su) An ancient or older brass dragon can create a powerful sandstorm once per day as a full-round action. This storm has a radius of 1 mile and lasts for 1 minute per age category of the dragon. This functions as a sandstorm (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431), except that it is also accompanied by windstorm-level winds.  Sleep Breath (Su) Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a 50 ft. cone of sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+11 rounds.																												
Advodaza Devil	18.00	153600	Huge	11	35, touch 15, flat-footed 28	297	21	18	15	idol armor	29		40 ft., fly 80 ft. (average)	bite +28 (2d6+12), 2 claws +28 (1d8+12 plus infernal wound),  2 hooves +26 (1d8+6), tail +26 (2d6+6)		15 ft.	15 ft. (20 ft. with tail)		Str 34, Dex 25, Con 30, Int 23, Wis 25, Cha 24	18	32	49 (53 vs. trip)	AP 30	Devil Mark (Su) An advodaza can grant worthy servants a measure of its power. As a full-round action, an advodaza can touch a willing adjacent creature, marking it with a unique symbol similar to an arcane mark. This symbol can be either visible or invisible, as the devil chooses. For as long as the target possesses the mark, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see the false divinity ability). The target also gains the ability to telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance as long as the two creatures are on the same plane. An advodaza can mark multiple creatures, up to an amount equaling its Hit Dice (typically 18). An advodaza can dispel its mark as a standard action, no matter where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, deal pain to a mark bearer that causes 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw.  An advodaza's mark cannot be removed physically, but a dispel magic or erase spell that succeeds on a dispel check or caster level check of DC 30 removes the effect.  False Divinity (Su) Advodazas possess areas of concern as deities do, but on a far smaller scale. Each advodaza chooses one cleric domain and gains the domain spells (up to 5th level) of that domain as spell-like abilities, each of which it can use 3 times per day. The advodaza does not gain any of the domain's granted powers. Most advodazas possess powers from the Evil, Fire, Law, War, or Weather domains, though any domain is possible.  Evil Domain: align weapon (evil only), dispel good, magic circle against good, protection from good, unholy blight Fire Domain: burning hands, fire shield, fireball, produce flame, wall of fire Law Domain: align weapon (law only), dispel chaos, magic circle against chaos, order's wrath, protection from chaos War Domain: divine power, flame strike, magic vestment, magic weapon, spiritual weapon Weather Domain: call lightning, fog cloud, ice storm, obscuring mist, sleet storm Idol Armor (Su) Advodazas armor themselves in their fallen idols and ornaments of devotion. This armor grants an advodaza a +6 armor bonus to AC and immunity to cold, electricity, and sonic damage, as well as immunity to the spell dismissal. The spells chaos hammer, holy smite, holy word, and word of chaos destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC and immunities (its cold immunity decreases to its normal resistance 10). If uninterrupted for 1 hour, an advodaza can summon new armor to replace its destroyed protection.  Infernal Wound (Su) The damage an advodaza deals with its claws causes persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is di#cult to stanch-a DC 30 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects.  The Heal check and caster level DC are Constitution-based.

A creature killed in this way cannot be brought back to life via any effect short of true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but even these spells require the caster to succeed at a caster level check equal to 10 + the targeted creature's Hit Dice. If this check fails, the caster can't attempt to return the targeted creature to life for the next 24 hours (though the caster can try again after this period).  Powerful Jaw (Ex) An ammut's bite attack deals 4d6 points of damage plus one and a half times its Strength bonus. In addition, its reach with this attack is 5 feet further than normal and it gains the grab ability when attacking with its bite.  Swallow Whole (Ex) An ammut can swallow creatures size Large or smaller with this special ability, and can only swallow one creature at a time regardless of the creature's size. In addition, creatures swallowed by an ammut are subject to its wasting curse.  Wasting Curse (Su) Swallow whole-contact; save Will DC 29; frequency 1 hour; effect 1d4 Cha drain. A creature whose Charisma score is reduced to 0 by this wasting curse dies; its body is destroyed and it is subject to the ammut's devour soul ability as if it had died while within the ammut's gut. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand.

Electricity Aura (Su) An adult blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Mirage (Su) An old or older blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage. Sandstorm (Su) As a standard action, a great wyrm blue dragon can create a sandstorm centered on itself with a radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the dragon inside the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition to the normal sandstorm penalties (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431). This sandstorm lasts for up to 1 hour, but can be dismissed by the dragon as a free action. Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A blue dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-ghost sound; Juvenile-minor image; Adult-ventriloquism; Old-hallucinatory terrain; Ancient- veil; Great wyrm-mirage arcana. Storm Breath (Su) An ancient or older blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions as call lightning storm, but the damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds.

Mighty Roar (Su) Every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a ravener behemoth can issue a mighty roar in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of greater shout. This attack deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 20d6 against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. Creatures exposed to the sonic attack can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save (DC 30). The save DC is Constitution-based. Rock Hurling (Ex) Because of their immense hunger, ravener behemoths often ingest ore-laced rocks to fill their stomachs with longer-lasting sustenance. When faced with dangerous opponents outside its reach, a behemoth may regurgitate these rocks and grind them into smaller shards with its hardened teeth. It then spits forth these shards one at a time as boulders weighing between 60 to 80 pounds. A ravener usually carries enough rocks in its stomachs to make up to 4d6 boulders in this manner. Shock Wave (Ex) As a full-round action, a ravener behemoth can hammer the ground with its feet and generate a localized tremor that rips the ground, knocking down smaller creatures and creating di#cult terrain in a 100-foot radius centered on the behemoth. This shock wave lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures in the affected area cannot move or attack. They must also succeed on a DC 38 Reflex save or fall prone. Any spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The save DC is Strength-based. Swallow Whole (Ex) A ravener behemoth can swallow a snatched opponent of Huge size or smaller with its bite attack by making a successful grapple check. Once swallowed, a victim suffers 4d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage per round from one of the behemoth's 5 stomachs. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 33 points of damage to a stomach (AC 27). Once the creature exits, that stomach regenerates 15 hit points per round. A ravener behemoth may gorge itself upon multiple creatures, shunting each victim to a different stomach each time. Each of a behemoth's 5 stomachs can hold 1 Huge, 4 Large, 16 Medium, 64 Small, 256 Tiny, or over 1,000 Diminutive or smaller creatures.

In addition, this bile is infused with negative energy, and inflicts 1d4 negative levels on all creatures struck by it. A successful DC 28 Reflex save halves the damage and  completely negates the negative levels. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Death Curse (Su) Curse of Decay: save Will DC 28; effect the creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage per day, and ages at an accelerated rate of 1 year per day, eventually incurring all of the penalties of old age but none of the benefits (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169).

Blessing of the Gilded Host (Su) Once per week, a gold colossus can bless an army using the rules for mass combat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 234), granting the army a +2 bonus to its Offensive Modifier and on Morale checks until the end of its next battle or for 1 week, whichever comes first.  Selective Antimagic Aura (Su) Spells with the compulsion or teleportation descriptor are unaffected by this field.  Suppressing Stomp (Su) Whenever a gold colossus deals stomp damage to a target, it reduces the target's damage reduction and spell resistance by 2 for 1 minute.  Each stomp thereafter increases the reduction by 2 (maximum reduction of 10) and resets the duration.

Other demons are immune to the choronzon's aura of confusion. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a choronzon can breathe forth a cone of bluish gas in a 40-foot cone. The gas lingers in the area for 1d2 rounds before dispersing. A creature killed by a choronzon's breath weapon has its body break apart into its individual protons, neutrons, and electrons. Creatures killed in this manner can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Breath Weapon (Su) An elemental air dragon's breath weapon is a 50 ft. cone of superheated air. Cyclone (Ex) By beating its wings rapidly back and forth, a hovering elemental air dragon can create a cyclone-like force of wind in a 30-foot radius around its body. This cyclone has the following effects: movement through the cyclone is one-quarter normal, ranged attacks suffer a -8 circumstance penalty in the area, and all nonmagical unprotected flames are automatically extinguished. Large or smaller creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 27 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round they remain in the area. Medium or smaller creatures in the area must succeed on a second Reflex save (same DC) or be knocked prone and back 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.

This breath weapon is effective both on the surface and underwater. Capsize (Ex) An elemental water dragon can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the elemental water dragon's size, it takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check. Drench (Ex) The elemental water dragon's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental's HD). Water Mastery (Ex) An elemental water dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foes are touching water. If the opponent or elemental water dragon is touching the ground, the elemental water dragon takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) Transparency (Ex) When submerged, an elemental water dragon is effectively invisible (DC 35 Perception check when near the surface only) until it attacks.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Resistance to Poison (Ex) A ghaggurath is highly resistant to poison. Whenever it makes a saving throw against poison, it can roll its save twice, keeping the better result.  Spittle (Ex) In lieu of biting, a tentacle mouth can eject a fleshy worm, called a thrall worm, at a single target to a range of 50 feet. A target that is hit is automatically bitten by the worm and subjected to the ghaggurath's poison. Regardless of which head fires the worm, a ghaggurath can launch only 24 such worms in any 24-hour period.  When a thrall worm strikes its target, it quickly burrows into the target's body. This worm can be safely removed with a successful DC 30 Heal check or by the application of a cure spell; otherwise removing the worm deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to the target. After 1d4 rounds, the worm works its way so deep into the target's body that it can only be removed by cutting open the area (dealing 1d8 points of damage to the victim) before attempting a Heal check or casting a cure spell. A remove disease spell destroys the worm if the caster succeeds on a caster level check against DC 30. As long as a thrall worm remains inside a target, the target cannot heal the Wisdom damage dealt by the ghaggurath's poison. A creature can only ever have one thrall worm inside  it at one time; it can however be attacked by and bitten by multiple thrall worms. The check DCs are Constitution-based.  Thrall (Su) A victim whose Wisdom score drops to 0 from the ghaggurath's poison is automatically dominated (as by a dominate monster spell, CL 20th). This effect lasts until the thrall worm is removed and at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored. The ghaggurath does not have to concentrate each day to maintain this effect, and a dominated creature does not receive a save to break the effects. If the ghaggurath is slain, any thrall under its command fall unconscious and remain so until the thrall worm is removed and at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored.

Change Shape (Su) A young or older gray dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph.  Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gray dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is 180 ft.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)  A gray dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category.  • Young-fog cloud;  • Juvenile-create water;  • Old-control winds;  • Ancient-control water;  Water Breathing (Ex) A gray dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.

This creates heavy snow conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits vision as fog does.  Freezing Fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.  Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.  Ice Tomb (Sp) A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions.

(average)	2 claws +31 (2d6+10/19-20), 4 talons +31 (1d8+10)		5 ft.	5 ft.	breaching, mirror of the tainted rift	Str 31, Dex 20, Con 28, Int 17, Wis 21, Cha 22	21	+31 (+35 sunder)	46 (48 vs. sunder)	AP 78	Breaching (Su) When a katpaskir calls or summons a demon or creature with the fiendish simple template into an area where the summoned creature's entry would be blocked by a magical effect (such as magic circle against evil, forbiddance, or dimensional lock), it can force the caster or creator of the effect to attempt a caster level check against the katpaskir's spell resistance. On a failed check, the blocking effect is immediately and permanently negated.  Distance Distortion (Su) Reality bends and warps within 30 feet of a katpaskir. The demon moves and attacks normally through this distorted area, but other creatures within this area treat all distances as if they were double the actual distance for all purposes, including movement, range for spells, and ranged attacks. In addition, a creature that begins its turn within this aura must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or be slowed for 1 round (as the slow spell). Freedom of movement prevents the slow effect but not any of the other effects of the distance distortion aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Mirror of the Tainted Rift (Su) When one or more creature with the celestial simple template is summoned as part of the spell or ability within 30 feet of a katpaskir, the katpaskir can, as an immediate action, summon an equal number of creatures of the same type with the fiendish simple template. If a good-aligned outsider is called or summoned within 30 feet of a katpaskir, it can duplicate the calling or summoning spell as an immediate action, calling or summoning one or more demons as if it had cast the same spell.  Teleportation Disruption (Su) When a creature uses a teleportation effect to enter or leave a space within 30 feet of a katpaskir, the caster must immediately attempt a caster level check (DC equal to the katpaskir's spell resistance). On a failed check, the teleportation effect is negated. If it chooses, the katpaskir can instead redirect the arrival location of the teleportation effect to any unoccupied space within 120 feet.  Warp Sense (Ex) A katpaskir can automatically sense disruptions in the planar fabric within 1 mile. The demon is immediately aware of any conjuration effect used within this area, and it also knows the direction and approximate distance. When a teleportation effect is used within 1 mile of a katpaskir (including arriving within this area from somewhere else), the demon can use clairaudience/ clairvoyance as an immediate action centered on the point the teleportation effect originated from or the point the teleportation effect is directed at as long as the point is within 1 mile; if both points are within 1 mile, the katpaskir can use clairaudience/clairvoyance centered on both.																												
Kraken	18.00	153600	Gargantuan	4	32, touch 6, flat-footed 32	290	21	12	11				10 ft., swim 40 ft., jet 280 ft.	2 arms +26 (2d6+10/19-20 plus grab), 8 tentacles +24  (1d8+5 plus grab), bite +26 (2d8+10)		20 ft.	20 ft. (60 ft. with arm, 40 ft. with tentacle)	constrict (tentacles, 1d8+10), ink cloud, rend ship	Str 30, Dex 10, Con 29, Int 21, Wis 20, Cha 21	20	+34 (+38 grapple)	44 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary	Ink Cloud (Ex) A kraken can emit a cloud of black, venomous ink in an 80-foot spread once per minute as a free action while underwater. This cloud provides total concealment, which the kraken can use to escape a fight that is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in darkness. In addition, the ink is toxic, functioning as contact poison against all creatures caught within it.  The ink cloud persists for 1 minute before dispersing. The save DC against the poison effect is Constitution-based.  Kraken Ink: Ink cloud-contact; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1 Str damage plus nausea; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Jet (Ex) A kraken can jet backward as a full-round action, at a speed of 280 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.  Rend Ship (Ex) As a full-round action, a kraken can attempt to use four of its tentacles to grapple a ship of its size or smaller. It makes a CMB check opposed by the ship's captain's Profession (sailor) check, but the kraken gets a cumulative +4 bonus on the check for each size category smaller than Gargantuan the ship is. If the kraken grapples the ship, it holds the ship motionless; it can attack targets anywhere on or within the ship with its tentacles, but can only attack foes on deck with its free arms and can't attack foes at all with its beak. Each round it maintains its hold on the ship, it automatically inflicts bite damage on the ship's hull.  Tenacious Grapple (Ex) A kraken does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with its arms or tentacles.																												
Mythic Phoenix	18.00	153600	Gargantuan	12	37, touch 16, flat-footed 27	280	17	20	14	self-resurrection	29	vulnerable to cold	30 ft., fly 90 ft.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Incinerate (Su) Any creature killed by fire damage from a mythic phoenix is entirely destroyed, leaving behind only a trace of fine ash. The creature's magical equipment is unaffected.  Self-Resurrection (Su) Unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate, a slain mythic phoenix remains dead for only 1d4 rounds, emerging fully healed from its remains as if brought back to life via resurrection. A phoenix can self-resurrect only once per year. If a phoenix dies a second time before that year passes, its death is permanent. A mythic phoenix that dies within the area of a mythic desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until the spell ends, at which point the phoenix immediately resurrects. A phoenix brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a result.  Shroud of Flame (Su) A mythic phoenix can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As long as its feathers are burning, any creature within reach must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save each round to avoid taking 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the phoenix with natural or non-reach melee weapons takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Nemesis Devil	18.00	153600	Huge	11	36, touch 15, flat-footed 29	297	21	18	13	idol armor	29		40 ft., fly 80 ft. (average)	bite +28 (2d6+12), 2 claws +28 (1d8+12 plus infernal wound), 2 slams +26 (1d8+6), tail slap +26 (2d6+6)		15 ft.	15 ft. (20 ft. with tail)	infernal wound	Str 34, Dex 25, Con 30, Int 23, Wis 25, Cha 24	18	+32 (+36 bull rush)	49 (51 vs. bull rush, 53 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Devil Mark (Su) An advodaza can grant worthy servants a measure of its power. As a full-round action, an advodaza can touch a willing creature, marking it with a unique symbol. For as long as the creature is marked, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see false divinity, below). The target can also telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance while on the same plane. An advodaza can dismiss its mark as a standard action, no matter where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, cause pain to a mark bearer that deals 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw. An advodaza can mark multiple creatures, up to a number equal to its Hit Dice (typically 18).  False Divinity (Su) Each advodaza chooses one cleric domain and gains the domain spells (5th level and lower) of that domain as spell-like abilities. Each of these abilities can be used 3 times per day. The advodaza does not gain any of the domain's granted powers. Most advodazas possess powers from the Evil, Fire, Law, Trickery, War, or Weather domains, though any domains except Good or Chaos are possible. These spell-like abilities are not included in the stat block above. Evil Domain: align weapon (evil only), dispel good, magic circle against good, protection from good, unholy blight Fire Domain: burning hands, fire shield, fireball, produce flame, wall of fire Law Domain: align weapon (law only), dispel chaos, magic circle against chaos, order's wrath, protection from chaos Trickery Domain: confusion, disguise self, false vision, invisibility, nondetection War Domain: divine power, flame strike, magic vestment, magic weapon, spiritual weapon Weather Domain: call lightning, fog cloud, ice storm, obscuring mist, sleet storm  Idol Armor (Su) Advodazas armor themselves in fallen idols and ornaments of devotion. This armor grants an advodaza a +7 armor bonus to AC and immunity to cold, electricity, and sonic damage, as well as immunity to the spell dismissal. The spells chaos hammer, holy smite, holy word, and word of chaos destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC and its immunities (its cold immunity is replaced with the devil's normal cold resistance of 10). The armor is automatically destroyed if the advodaza is slain. If uninterrupted for 1 hour, an advodaza can summon new armor to replace its destroyed protection.  Infernal Wound (Su) An advodaza's assaults leave vicious marks that do not easily heal. The damage an advodaza inflicts with its claws leaves persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is difficult to stanch-a successful DC 29 Heal check is required to stop the bleeding, and anyone attempting to magically heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 29 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects. The Heal check DC and caster level DC are Constitution-based.

Poison (Su) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution drain and 1 negative level; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Noqual Golem	18.00	153600	Huge	2	32, touch 10, flat-footed 30	202	8	10	8	spell absorption			40 ft.	2 slams +36 (4d8+19/19-20 plus spell sunder)		15 ft.	15 ft.	construct bane	Str 36, Dex 15, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	25	40	52	Inner Sea Bestiary	Construct Bane (Ex) A noqual golem deals an additional 2d6 points of damage against constructs (except other noqual golems) and undead created by feats or spells.  Immunity to Magic (Su) A noqual golem is immune to and absorbs any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  • A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a noqual golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. If the golem is under a haste effect, the attack breaks the haste effect instead.  • A mage's disjunction spell staggers a noqual golem and negates its impeded magic ability for 1d4 rounds.  Impeded Magic (Su) To successfully cast a spell within 60 feet of a noqual golem, a caster must make a concentration check (DC 25 + the level of the spell being cast). If the check fails, the noqual golem absorbs the spell.  Powerful Blows (Ex) A noqual golem inflicts 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks.  Spell Absorption (Su) A noqual golem absorbs any spells blocked or dispelled by its impeded magic, immunity to magic, and spell sunder abilities. It heals 5 points of damage for every spell level absorbed. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. Absorbing a spell gives the golem the benefits of haste (as the spell) for 1 round per spell level.  Spell Sunder (Su) A creature struck by a noqual golem's slam attack is targeted by dispel magic (CL 18th). It absorbs any spells so dispelled.

Shears (Su) A norn's shears function as a +5 mithral keen speed scimitar, but only for a norn.  Shift Fate (Su) As an immediate action, a norn can force any one target within 120 feet to reroll a saving throw-this ability must be used immediately after the saving throw is rolled, and the target must abide by the result of this second roll.  Snip Thread (Su) As a standard action up to three times per day but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, a norn may produce a golden thread linked to a creature's fate and then attempt to snip it short with her shears. The target creature must be within 120 feet and in the norn's line of sight. The target immediately takes 20d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC 30 half). If the target dies from this damage, the norn has cut through the thread-in this case, the target may only be restored to life via miracle, wish, or divine intervention. This is a death effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.

Detect Gems (Sp) A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones.  Fast Flight (Ex) A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed.  Fire Aura (Su) An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an aura of fire. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient gold dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action.  Luck (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.  Weakening Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).																												
Purrodaemon	18.00	153600	Large	10	35, touch 19, flat-footed 29	294	25	21	14		29		30 ft., fly 60 ft.

This does no damage to the daemon. If a weapon remains sheathed in its body for at least 24 hours, the weapon absorbs some of its essence and gains magical enhancements. A purrodaemon can have up to a dozen weapons lodged in its body at a time, but only one can possess magical enhancements at a time. The total enhancements cannot exceed a +4 effective enhancement-most purrodaemons opt to create +2 wounding weapons in this manner. A weapon's enhancements vanish as soon as the purrodaemon dies or releases the weapon. A purrodaemon gains Weapon Focus and Improved Critical as bonus feats as long as it wields a weapon benefiting from its weapon steep ability.

When it does, it doubles the threat range of all attacks using weapons, natural attacks, and rock attacks it makes until the start of its next turn. Furthermore, once per day when the great cyclops reaches 0 or fewer hit points and is conscious because of its Diehard feat, this ability recharges, allowing the great cyclops to use the ability a second time that day.

A DC 28 Will save negates the effects of this aura for 1 round, but a new save must be made each round to continue to resist the effects. The saving throw is Charisma-based.  Banishing Swipe (Su) A simurgh can use its radiant tail to return creatures to their native planes. In addition to taking damage, any extraplanar creature touched by a simurgh's tail must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be affected as if by banishment. A creature that makes this save cannot be affected by the same simurgh's banishing swipe for the next 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Glaring Ray (Su) A simurgh can blast a fiery ray of brilliant light from its eyes as a standard action to a range of 100 feet.  Radiant Feathers (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a simurgh can fan out its glimmering tail feathers and blast its foes with a 100-foot cone of radiant light from its tail. Aside from its size, this attack is identical to a prismatic spray (DC 28). The save is Charisma-based.

After using its gaze attack in this manner, the slorath cannot use its paralyzing gaze for 1d4 rounds and it is disoriented during this time (-2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks).

Any creature in the area must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or contract mummy rot (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 210). The disease is contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply) and is an instantaneous effect. Ongoing saving throws against the disease use the dragon's breath weapon DC. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Disease (Ex) A taniniver's natural attacks infect its opponent with a random disease from the following list: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, leprosy, mindfire, or shakes. The initial saving throw against these diseases uses the breath weapon's DC.																												
Thriae Queen	18.00	153600	Huge	4	33, touch 8, flat-footed 33	312	15	14	15	merope coat	29		30 ft., fly 50 ft.

A thriae queen using this ability can control the purity of the merope she launches, which makes it either harm those it touches or heal them. If a thriae queen chooses to make her merope harmful, all creatures in the area of effect take 20d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 29 half ). In addition, any creature in the area of effect is also staggered for 1d4 rounds (or 1 round if it succeeds at its Reflex save). If she uses it to heal, the merope heals all living creatures in the area of effect for 10d8 points of damage. A thriae queen can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Merope Coat (Su) A thriae queen is covered in a thin layer of merope. This coating acts as a magical barrier between spells cast at the thriae queen, as though she were constantly under the effects of spell turning. The coat affects a maximum of eight spell levels-when a spell effect is turned, this coating is depleted by a number of spell levels equal to the level of the spell reflected. The queen regenerates this coating at a rate of one spell level per round. A spell in excess of what the merope coat can currently reflect is not reflected, and reduces the merope coat to a score of 0. Spells that fail to penetrate the queen's spell resistance do not reduce the merope coat's efficiency in this manner.  Spawn Soldiers (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a thriae queen can spawn a large swarm of wasps. This functions as four separate wasp swarms (Bestiary 275) that occupy all of the squares adjacent to the thriae queen. These swarms do not harm any thriae, and while they move with the queen as she moves, the swarms cannot leave her side. The swarms last until they are destroyed or 1 hour passes, at which point the swarms die on their own.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con plus staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.

One stinger drains 1d4 points of Strength, another drains 1d4 points of Dexterity, and the third drains 1d4 points of Charisma. Any sting's drain is negated by a DC 29 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Demon Hunter (Ex) A thulgant gains a +10 racial bonus on caster level checks to penetrate the spell resistance of any demon. Its attacks are treated as cold iron and good against demons.  Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to a thulgant's horrific appearance are stunned for 1d4 rounds and take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage.  Savage Stingers (Ex) If a thulgant hits a single target with all three stings in the same round, it tears through the victim's body, dealing an extra 3d6+12 points of damage and draining an additional 2 ability points from all six of the victim's ability scores. A single DC 29 Fortitude save negates all of this additional ability drain. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Rock Spitting (Ex) A thunder behemoth can spit rocks from the essentially inexhaustible store in its gizzard. It can spit up to four rocks as a standard action, with a range increment of 60 feet. A creature that is critically hit by one of these rocks must make a DC 38 Fortitude save to resist being stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.  Swallow Whole (Ex) A thunder behemoth has five stomachs and can shunt a swallowed victim into any one of them (usually choosing an empty stomach).																												
Vavakia	18.00	153600	Huge	2	35, touch 14, flat-footed 33	297	22	8	18		29		40 ft. (60 ft. without armor), fly 60 ft. (average)	#ERROR!		15 ft.	15 ft.; 30 ft. with ranseur	breath weapon, trample (1d8+16, DC 30)	Str 32, Dex 14, Con 33, Int 18, Wis 21, Cha 23	18	31	47 (51 vs. trip)	Book of the Damned V2	Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a vavakia can breathe out a 60-foot cone of green fire that seems to writhe and coil with the tortured shapes of a thousand screaming ghosts. This green fire is akin to vomiting up the countless souls the vavakia has consumed, and these souls consume flesh as surely as they consume sanity. A creature struck by this breath weapon takes 20d6 points of damage (DC 30 Reflex half )-this damage manifests as blackened, melted flesh and skin but is treated as raw profane power.  Evil creatures take half damage from the breath weapon, but good creatures who take any damage from a vavakia's breath weapon are automatically staggered for 1 round by the hideous sensation. In addition, any living creature that takes damage from a vavakia's breath weapon must also make a DC 30 Fortitude save to avoid suffering 1d8 points of Wisdom drain as her sanity slips away into madness.  Immediately after the vavakia expels this green "soulfire," the wailing flames flow in reverse back into the demon's gullet through its open maw. This heals the vavakia 1d8 points of damage for each creature that was damaged by its breath weapon. The Wisdom drain element of this breath weapon is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Smoking Wound (Su) The wounds caused by a vavakia's fangs result in tremendous and eerie wounds. Rather than blood, wisps of green smoke constantly weep from a vavakia's bite wound-a grim manifestation of the demon's effect on a mortal soul. Each time a vavakia bites a creature, it bestows two negative levels-the wounds continue to smoke as long as the victim suffers those negative levels. The smoking wounds cause the victim to become sickened because of the hideous sensation and rank smell of the vapors. An effect that removes this sickened condition only temporarily causes the wounds to stop smoking-they begin smoking again in 1d6 rounds and persist as long as the victim suffers from the associated negative levels. Nonliving creatures bitten by a vavakia are immune to its energy-draining bite and do not exhibit smoking wounds. The Fortitude save to remove these negative levels is DC 25. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Stun (Ex) A creature struck by a vavakia's tail slap must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. On a critical hit, the stun effect lasts for 1d4 rounds on a failed save, and 1 round on a successful save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6.  Manipulate Flames (Su) An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires.  Smoke Vision (Ex) A very young red dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics).

Any creature struck by this bolt must also succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round by the overwhelming stench of the acid. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Flowing Robes (Su) A water yai wears a special silk kimono  infused with magical water. This kimono grants a +6 armor bonus. These robes function as armor only for water yai.  Liquid Form (Sp) As a standard action, a water yai can turn into a mobile pool of water. This functions like gaseous form, except that the yai cannot fly in this form. It retains its own base speed, and its swim speed doubles to 120 feet. The water yai can end this ability as a standard action.

Mass Laughter (Sp) An ancient copper dragon can tell a fantastic joke once per day as a standard action. All creatures within 10 feet per age category must make a Will save or laugh for 1 round per age category, as if affected by hideous laughter. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is equal to a 6th-level spell.  Slow Aura (Su) An old or older copper dragon is surrounded by an aura of slowness. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon must make a Will save or be affected as per slow for 1 round. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. For great wyrm copper dragons, those opponents that fail their saves are slowed for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. A copper dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.  Slow Breath (Su) Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.  Trap Master (Ex) A juvenile or older copper dragon receives a +1 bonus per age category on Craft (traps) and Perception checks made to locate a trap. Upon becoming a mature adult, he can also use Disable Device to disarm magic traps as if he had the rogue's Trapfinding class feature.

Miasma (Su) An ancient or older green dragon can use its breath weapon to create a cloud of acid as a standard action that deals damage to any creature inside it. The cloud moves with the dragon and has a radius of 20 feet. When it's created, anyone inside this area takes an amount of damage equal to half the dragon's breath weapon, with a Reflex save for half damage. The number of damage dice rolled is halved each round until the result would be less than 1d6. Any creature that starts its turn inside the cloud takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. A strong wind, such as that created by a gust of wind, disperses the cloud in 1 round.  Trackless Step (Ex) An adult or older green dragon does not leave a trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. A green dragon can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires.  Water Breathing (Ex) A green dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

In addition, whenever an adamantine golem scores a critical hit, it deals 6d10+13 points of damage to the target's armor or shield in addition to the normal damage, as if it had also made a successful sunder combat maneuver.  Indestructible (Ex) An adamantine golem is nearly impossible to destroy. Even if reduced below 0 hit points, its fast healing continues to restore hit points, though the golem is helpless unless above 0 hit points. It can only be permanently destroyed if reduced to negative hit points and then decapitated using an adamantine vorpal weapon- alternatively, miracle or wish can be used to slay it while it is at negative hit points.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) An adamantine golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, except as noted below.  • Transmute metal to wood slows an adamantine golem for 1d4 rounds, during which time its damage reduction is reduced to 15/adamantine (no save).

Destructive Crush (Su) When an old or older forest dragon makes a crush attack, the impact kicks up debris in a 20-foot-radius burst for 1d6 rounds. The debris obscures the vision of creatures within the debris field and grants concealment to those creatures. The forest dragon can see normally within and through the debris field.  Elemental Breath (Su) Once per day, when an ancient or older forest dragon uses its breath weapon, it can summon a greater earth elemental within the cone. The caster level for these effects is the same as the dragon's caster level.

Alien Presence (Su) A vortex dragon's alien presence bends space. A creature that fails its saving throw treats all other creatures as if they were under the effects of blur (or displacement if the target has 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6 rounds.  Collapsing Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of fire, an ancient or older vortex dragon can suck a single target into its maw. If the target fails its Reflex save (DC equal to breath weapon), it is swallowed whole and takes 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage per round. A creature can cut itself out by dealing 30 points of damage with a light or one-handed piercing or slashing weapon. A vortex dragon's interior has an AC of 26.  Fragmented Strike (Su) An adult or older vortex dragon can strike with its bite through a rift in space. This allows it to make its bite attack against a target anywhere within the radius of its alien presence as long as the dragon can see the creature. This doesn't apply to attacks of opportunity.

Though they are able to work in concert as a cohesive whole, they are also able to separate their actions at will so as to not be impeded by the limitations of a single consciousness, effectively allowing them to focus on two things at once. As a result, the charnel colossus can use up to two spell-like abilities in the same round that it makes physical attacks or other full-found actions. It also gains an additional spell attack per round. In addition, a charnel colossus is immune to being turned (though it can still take damage from channeled positive energy). While part of the creature's sentience may be affected by a turn attempt, there are enough unaffected intellects within to override the effect.  Mind Feed (Su) When a charnel colossus succeeds at a grapple check with a slam attack, it can use its mind feed ability as a free action during each round in which the grapple is maintained. A victim of a mind feed attempt must succeed at a DC 38 Will save each round that the ability is used. On a failed save, the cadavers that make up the charnel colossus lock their mouths against the victim and begin to draw forth a part of her sentience to add to the collective. This action deals 1d6 points of Wisdom damage per round. If the victim's Wisdom score is reduced to 0, her soul and persona are wholly subsumed by the charnel colossus, and her body becomes bleached white and brittle and is incorporated into the creature's mass. The charnel colossus then has full access to all of the victim's memories (though not any special powers), and the victim can only be recovered and returned to life with a wish or miracle. If the charnel colossus has grappled multiple victims, it can attempt multiple mind feeds in a single round. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  Voice of the Ancients (Su) A charnel colossus can, as a full-round action, cause its collective knowledge to be whispered into the minds of any sentient creature within 100 feet. These whispers riffle through the brain of any such creatures within range in a maddening susurrus. These individuals must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or be paralyzed and frozen in place as if by the hold monster spell. The victim may attempt a new save each round to try and break the effect.  Regardless of whether or not the save is successful, the effect leaves an insidious seed implanted in the victim's mind. The day after the save is made, the victim must succeed at a new save or the seed takes root and creates the subconscious compulsion for the victim to return to the charnel colossus at some point in the future. When and how this occurs is up the GM. This compulsion can be removed with a remove curse spell or by destroying the charnel colossus that implanted the compulsion.  This is a mind-affecting compulsion and cannot be negated by a silence spell because it is heard directly in the mind of the victim. Each time a creature is subjected to this attack, there is a 1% chance that some of the lost lore transmitted into her mind causes her to gain a permanent +2 bonus to Intelligence. This beneficial side effect can only occur to a creature once. When a charnel colossus uses this ability, it cannot use its spell-like abilities or take other actions in that round. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Clockwork Goliath	19.00	204800	Gargantuan	9	35, touch 13, flat-footed 28	214	9	16	9			vulnerable to electricity	40 ft.	4 slams +41 (3d6+17)	cannon +29/+24/+19/+14 (6d6/x4)	20 ft.	20 ft.	self-destruction, trample (3d6+25, DC 41)	Str 45, Dex 20, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	28	49	66	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Cannon (Ex) One of a goliath's arms ends in a cannon. The goliath may use this as one of its four slam attacks, or it can use it to fire cannonballs. A cannon has a range increment of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a hit with a x4 critical modifier. A clockwork goliath's cannon can hold up to 12 cannonballs-reloading a single cannonball is a standard action.  Self-Destruction (Su) When a goliath's hit points are reduced to 10% its total (21 hp for most clockwork goliaths) or less but still above 0, it self-destructs on its next turn, bursting in an explosion of metal scraps and steam that deals 12d6 points of slashing damage plus 12d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 24 Reflex save halves the damage. The save is Constitution-based.																												
Deep Sea Serpent	19.00	204800	Gargantuan	9	34, touch 12, flat-footed 28	333	22	20	2	elusive			10 ft., swim 50 ft.	bite +33 (6d10+14/19-20 plus grab), tail slap +33 (6d8+14/19-20 plus grab)		20 ft.	20 ft.	capsize, constrict (6d8+21), powerful tail, swallow whole (10d6+21 bludgeoning damage, AC 21, 33 hp)	Str 39, Dex 20, Con 28, Int 2, Wis 17, Cha 11	23	2	15 (19 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Elusive (Su) As a full-round action while in water, a deep sea serpent can move up to its run speed (200 feet) without leaving any trace of its passing (identical in effect to pass without trace). An elusive deep sea serpent gains a +40 circumstance bonus on its Stealth check. In addition, except when in combat, a sea serpent is considered to be under the effects of a nondetection spell. Both of these effects function at caster level 20th and cannot be dispelled.  Powerful Tail (Ex) A deep sea serpent's tail slap is always a primary attack. When a deep sea serpent deals damage to an object with its tail slap or via constrict damage, it ignores the first 10 points of hardness that object possesses.  Surge (Ex) A deep sea serpent can surge forward as a full-round action at a speed of 400 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while surging.																												
Demoriel	19.00	204800	Medium	9	40, touch 25, flat-footed 35	210	11	17	6	resistant to good magic	30		40 ft., fly 60 ft.

This functions as a hold person spell (caster level 20th). An affected creature can attempt a new Will save each round to break the effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by Demoriel's enrapture for one day. Reaver: Reaver is Demoriel's finely crafted +3 unholy short sword.																												
Gallu	19.00	204800	Medium	8	34, touch 18, flat-footed 30	332	27	16	21	armor plating	30		50 ft., fly 50 ft. (good)	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft.	rain of blood, wounding blood	Str 33, Dex 18, Con 34, Int 18, Wis 23, Cha 25	19	+30 (+32 bull rush)	48 (50 vs. bull rush)	The Worldwound	Armor Plating (Su) The armor plates covering much of a gallu's body grant it a +8 armor bonus. They also function as armor spikes during grapples, but cannot be used as off-hand weapons. In addition, these armor plates can possess one additional armor special ability chosen from the following options: acid resistance 20, cold resistance 20, fire resistance 20, ghost touch, moderate fortification, or sonic resistance 20. A gallu demon can switch the active armor special quality once per hour as a swift action-as a general rule, the gallu demon keeps the armor plating set to moderate fortification. These armor plates do not encumber the gallu or impose armor check penalties, maximum Dex bonuses, or arcane spell failure chances. They cannot be removed, sundered, or destroyed while the gallu lives, and they rust away into nonmagical fragments of iron upon the gallu's death.  Aura of Havoc (Su) A gallu's presence wreaks havoc, infusing battlefields with elements of chaos and entropy that disrupt careful coordination and tactical plotting by manipulating fate and chance. This aura extends to a 30-foot radius around the gallu. The aid another action can never grant bonuses in this area, nor does flanking grant bonuses to hit in the affected area (although flanked foes remain susceptible to sneak attack damage). A creature summoned into this area by any creature other than a demon must succeed at a DC 26 Will save to avoid being confused for 1d4 rounds. Paladins and creatures with the lawful subtype must make a DC 26 Will save each round they begin their turn in this aura to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. Demons ignore the effects of a gallu's aura of havoc. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Rain of Blood (Su) As a standard action once per minute, a gallu can command the wounds of all creatures within 30 feet to erupt into a gory deluge of blood; any wounded creature in the area of effect immediately takes 3d6 points of damage from the rain of blood and must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude saving throw. Failure indicates that the damage becomes bleed damage and the affected creature becomes staggered from the pain as long as the bleed damage continues. Creatures that are immune to bleed damage are immune to this ability's effects. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Wounding Blood (Su) The spikes that hold a gallu's armor plates in place extend as far into the demon's body as they do outside of it, causing rivulets of blood to constantly run from the creature's flesh. This continual bleeding does not inconvenience or harm the gallu; instead, it grants the wounding special ability to all manufactured weapons wielded by the gallu. The dripping blood does not affect the gallu's natural attacks.																												
Great Wyrm Black Dragon	19.00	204800	Gargantuan	3	41, touch 5, flat-footed 41	377	23	14	21		30		60 ft., fly 250 ft. (clumsy), swim 60 ft.	bite +36 (4d6+19 plus 6d6 acid), 2 claws +35 (2d8+13), 2 wings +33 (2d6+6), tail slap +33 (2d8+19)		20 ft.	15 ft. (20 ft. with bite)	acid pool (60-ft. radius), acidic bite, breath weapon (120-ft. line, DC 31, 24d6 acid), corrupt water, crush (Medium creatures, DC 31, 4d6+19), tail sweep (Small creatures, 2d6+19, DC 31)	Str 37, Dex 8, Con 27, Int 20, Wis 23, Cha 20	26	43	52 (56 vs. trip)	d20pfsrd	Acid Pool (Su) An ancient or older black dragon can use its breath weapon to create an acid pool as a standard action. This acid pool has a radius of 60 feet. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes 24d6 points of acid damage (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the total damage dice of the pool is halved (10d6 round 2, 5d6 round 3, 2d6 round 4, 1d6 round 5) until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface. Acidic Bite (Su) At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6. Charm Reptiles (Sp) A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day. It works as a mass charm monster spell that affects only reptilian animals. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell. Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence. Crush (Ex) A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus. Speak with Reptiles (Sp) A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals. Swamp Stride (Ex) A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed. Tail Sweep (Ex) This allows a Gargantuan or larger dragon to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon). Water Breathing (Ex) A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.																												
Great Wyrm Brass Dragon	19.00	204800	Gargantuan	3	41, touch 5, flat-footed 41	377	23	14	21		30	vulnerability to cold	60 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 250 ft.

(25 ft. with bite)	breath weapon (120-ft. line, DC 31, 24d4 fire), crush (medium creatures, DC 31, 4d6+19), desert wind, sandstorm, sleep breath, summon djinni, tail sweep (small creatures, DC 31, 2d6+19)	Str 37, Dex 8, Con 27, Int 22, Wis 23, Cha 22	26	43	52 (56 vs. trip)	d20pfsrd	Desert Wind (Su) A juvenile or older brass dragon can call up the desert wind to serve him. This functions as gust of wind, but any creature in its path must make a Fortitude save (DC 31) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand. Fire Aura (Su) An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient brass dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A brass dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action. Move Sand (Su) A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 5th-level spell. Sandstorm (Su) An ancient or older brass dragon can create a powerful sandstorm once per day as a full-round action. This storm has a radius of 1 mile and lasts for 1 minute per age category of the dragon. This functions as a sandstorm (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431), except that it is also accompanied by windstorm-level winds. Sleep Breath (Su) Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a 60 ft. cone of sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+12 rounds. Summon Djinni (Sp) This ability, usable by a great wyrm brass dragon once per day, works like a summon monster spell, except that it summons one noble djinni. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.																												
Grendel	19.00	204800	Large	4	34, touch 13, flat-footed 30	340	16	16	16	ferocity, unstoppable			40 ft.	2 claws +32 (3d10+13/19-20 plus grab), bite +27 (4d8+6)		10 ft.	10 ft.	blood rage, brutal surge, gruesome dismemberment, mythic power (7/day, surge +1d10)	Str 36, Dex 19, Con 26, Int 9, Wis 15, Cha 8	20	+34 (+38 grapple)	48	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Brutal Surge (Su) When Grendel expends mythic power to add a surge die to an attack roll, he also adds a surge die to that attack's damage roll. This is not an action and does not require him to expend any additional uses of mythic power to use this ability.  Gruesome Dismemberment (Ex) When Grendel successfully holds a creature he has grappled, he may expend one use of mythic power to attempt to dismember that creature. He attempts a grapple check; if successful, his target takes double his normal claw damage and the attack pulls off one of the target's legs or arms. The target is sickened until it receives magical healing (or until it recovers to full hit points by natural means), and takes 2d6 points of bleed damage each round. A creature with only one an arm cannot perform actions requiring two arms or two hands. A bipedal creature with one leg missing cannot walk or run; it can crawl or hop, but is denied its Dexterity bonus against all opponents. A quadrupedal creature with one leg missing is reduced to half normal speed. At the GM's discretion, creatures with more than four legs affected by this attack may be able to move at normal speed.

Doing so causes brilliant light to radiate from the humbaba to a radius of 30 feet. Each round at the start of the humbaba's turn, roll 1d8 and consult the table of prismatic spray effects on page 325 of the Core Rulebook to determine the color and effect of the light (reroll results of 8). If a creature begins its turn in the prismatic aura's area, it must make the appropriate saving throw (DC 26) against that effect. Once activated, a humbaba's prismatic aura lasts for 7 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Leviathan	19.00	204800	Colossal	-2	30, touch 0, flat-footed 30	310	24	10	12		30		swim 60 ft.	bite +34 (6d6+22/19-20), tail slap +29 (4d6+11)		30 ft.	20 ft.	capsize, smashing breach, swallow whole (6d8+22 acid damage, AC 25, 31 hp), tail storm, whale song	Str 54, Dex 6, Con 30, Int 18, Wis 18, Cha 21	20	50	58 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors 4	Smashing Breach (Ex) As a full-round action, a leviathan can make a special charge attack against creatures on the surface of the water. At the end of its charge, the leviathan breaches, then slams down onto the target with incredible force. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the leviathan's space must make a DC 30 Reflex save or take 4d8+33 points of bludgeoning damage and be forced into the nearest square that is adjacent to the whale. This breach automatically attempts to capsize any boats caught wholly or partially in this area. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Tail Storm (Ex) As a full-round action, a leviathan can raise its massive tail and bring it crashing down into the water, causing a massive wave that sinks ships in the area. The resulting wave fans out from the leviathan's tail in a 100-foot cone. Huge or small er ships caught in the area and within 10 feet of the leviathan's tail automatically sink. Creatures in the water and within 10 feet of the leviathan's tail take 4d6+22 points bludgeoning damage. A successful DC 42 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Additionally, a creature that fails its save is pushed 6d6 x 10 feet away. Huge or smaller ships more than 10 feet away within the area must succeed on a Profession (sailor) check or capsize. The DC of this check is 42, decreasing by 5 for every 10 feet from the leviathan a ship is. The DC increases by a cumulative +5 for each size smaller than Huge a ship is. The save and base check DC is Strength-based.  Whale Song (Su) As a swift action, a leviathan can unleash a song that is so deep and of such low frequency that the vibrations alone have adverse effects on living creatures. Any living creature within 100 feet of a singing leviathan must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. A creature that succeeds on its save is unaffected by that leviathan's whale song for one day. This song is more felt than heard, and can be detected by creatures up to 10 miles away. Creatures capable of detecting extremely low-frequency sounds (e.g. dolphins, whales, other leviathans) can detect this song up to 100 miles away. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Obcisidaemon	19.00	204800	Gargantuan	4	34, touch 10, flat-footed 30	319	22	11	18		30		30 ft., fly 60 ft. (average)	#ERROR!		20 ft.	20 ft.	cloak of souls	Str 30, Dex 19, Con 28, Int 13, Wis 21, Cha 24	22	36	50	Horsemen Of The Apocalypse	Cloak of Souls (Su) An obcisidaemon is surrounded by a dark  cloud of souls it has consumed, often resembling a tattered, ethereal cloak. When an obcisidaemon successfully captures a soul with its inherit soul ability, the soul becomes a part of its cloak of souls, taking up one soul slot. An obcisidaemon has a number of soul slots equal to its Charisma modifier (usually 7). An obcisidaemon can consume a soul as a swift action to achieve a particular effect. When a soul within this cloak is consumed by the obcisidaemon, it is immolated as though by the destruction spell. Destroying the daemon frees the souls in its cloak, though this does not return the deceased creatures to life. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a cloak of souls requires a DC 28 caster level check. Failure results in the spell having no effect, while success tears the victim's soul free from the cloak and returns the creature to life as normal. If the daemon is in an unholy location, such as that created by the unhallow spell, the DC of this caster level check increases by +2. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based. An obcisidaemon can achieve one of the following effects by consuming a single soul.  • Increase the DC of the next spell-like ability the obcisidaemon uses that round by +1.  • Give the obcisidaemon 3d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.  • Increase the damage of the obcisidaemon's next melee attack that round by +1d6 hit points.  Inherit Soul (Su) Whenever an obcisidaemon kills a creature with its halberd, that creature must immediately make a DC 31 Fortitude save or be consumed by the daemon's cloak of souls. This is a death effect. If the cloak cannot consume this soul without exceeding its number of soul slots, the daemon can release a soul as a free action in order to make room for the new soul, otherwise, the killed creature automatically succeeds at its save and its soul is not absorbed. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Scorched Earth (Su) A creature that dies within 60 feet of an obcisidaemon must immediately make a DC 28 Fortitude save to prevent its body from being utterly consumed in unholy fire equivalent to the destruction spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Str 42, Dex 27, Con 30, Int 9, Wis 22, Cha 25	17	41	59 (67 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Death Throes (Su) When a sard dies, its remains explode with a blast of lightning into razor-sharp splinters of wood. All creatures within 30 feet of a sard when it explodes in this manner take 12d6 points of electricity damage and 12d6 points of piercing damage. A DC 31 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Electrical Jolt (Su) Every time a creature strikes a sard with a metal melee weapon, arcs of electricity deal 1d10 points of damage to the attacker.  Planar Acclimation (Ex) A sard is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.  Poison (Ex) Thorn-injury; save Fort DC 31; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex and 4d6 electricity; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Thorns (Ex) A sard's thorns have a range of 180 ft. with no range increment.

Maddening Cacophony (Su) As a free action, a shoggoth can give voice to sounds and words sane life was not meant to hear. All creatures in a 60-foot radius must make a DC 22 Will save or be confused for 1d6 rounds. Each round a creature is affected it takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. A creature that saves cannot be affected by this shoggoth's maddening cacophony for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Engulf (Ex) To use this ability, the shoggoth must begin its turn grappling a creature or must trample. A shoggoth may attempt to engulf as many creatures as it grapples or tramples in a round. This ability otherwise functions as swallow whole, save that a creature that cuts is way out of a shoggoth leaves no hole in the protoplasmic creature's body.

These weapons function as +1 daggers that bestow one permanent negative level on a successful hit. A DC 27 Fortitude negates the negative level, although on a critical hit, no save is allowed. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Death-Stealing Gaze (Su) 1 permanent negative level, 30 ft., Fort DC 27 negates. Creatures slain by these negative levels become juju zombies (see page 291) under the vrolikai's control. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 30) or be destroyed.  Electricity Aura (Su) A wyrm blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn.  Mirage (Su) A wyrm blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for 26 rounds per day. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.  Storm Breath (Su) A wyrm blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions as call lightning storm, but the damage is 22d8.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will.  Repulsion Breath (Su) Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  Vortex (Ex) Once per day, an ancient or older bronze dragon can create a vortex as a standard action, just like an elder water elemental. A bronze dragon can maintain this vortex for 1 round per age category.  Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.

An akvan possesses the armor training ability of a 15th-level fighter.  Aura of Hopelessness (Su) All creatures except divs within 30 feet of an akvan must make a successful DC 30 Will save or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Create Ghul (Su) Any genie that is slain by an akvan becomes a ghul (see page 125) in 1d4 rounds. Such ghuls are under the command of the akvan that created them and remain enslaved until it dies, at which point they become free-willed ghuls. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.  Shake Faith (Su) Anytime an akvan strikes a divine spellcaster with any of its melee attacks, the target must make a DC 30 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the save is successful, the target is instead shaken for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Torturous Gullet (Su) As hunters of otherworldly beings, akvans are uniquely drawn to digest creatures with a variety of resistances. In addition to the damage dealt by crushing internal organs, creatures swallowed by an akvan take 4d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage per round. The akvan chooses what type of energy damage those in its stomach will take every round, and may change this from round to round. Additionally, an akvan's stomach is thickly armored, allowing it to benefit from its entire natural armor bonus instead of merely half.																												
Amalgamation	20.00	307200	Gargantuan	9	25, touch 25, flat-footed 16	225	10	19	15				10 ft., fly 50 ft. (perfect)	varies +33 (damage by weapon)	varies +35 (damage by weapon)	20 ft.	15 ft.	multiple attacks, swarm attack (10d6)	Str 24, Dex 28, Con -, Int -, Wis 20, Cha 1	30	41	60	Tome of Horrors 4	Item Use (Su) The amalgamation can use any of the items contained within its bulk. When activating magic items, it is considered to be using them as if a person of the required class, with a 20 in any relevant ability scores (or its natural scores, whichever are better). Furthermore, because of its innate magical nature, the save DC against any effects produced by magic items is 2 greater than normal. Finally, it can wield weapons and items as if it were of the appropriate size class for their type, so it suffers no hit penalties for being a Gargantuan construct with such items. Unless instructed otherwise, the amalgamation uses items at random from its bulk. However, it does not target them randomly-it uses them with care and precision, as if it had 18 Intelligence. Items with limited uses, such as scrolls and wands, are expended normally.  Multiple Attacks (Ex) The amalgamation can activate and use up to five items per round. It can therefore attack with weapons, activate magic items, hurl alchemical items like thunderstones, or slam random objects against opponents.  Swarm Attack (Ex) The amalgamation can move over enemies and damage them with the flying weapons and objects composing its bulk. It does this simply by moving over its victims, who are allowed either a DC 34 Reflex save or an attack of opportunity against the amalgamation, at their option. Anyone who begins their turn engulfed by the amalgamation takes 10d6 points of damage per round, with a DC 34 Reflex save allowed for half. This is not considered an area effect for the purposes of evasion and similar abilities. The damage inflicted by the amalgamation overcomes all forms of damage reduction except epic. The save DC for both Reflex saves is Dexterity-based. Further, this damage is considered continuous for the purposes of determining if it disrupts spellcasting, concentration and the like.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) The amalgamation is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: Dispel magic and greater dispel magic can be used to deactivate magic items, as per a targeted item dispel. Mage's disjunction causes it to subside into quiescence for 1d4+1 rounds, during which time it is considered helpless.

Fast Flight (Ex) A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed. Fire Aura (Su) An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an aura of fire. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient gold dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action. Luck (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A gold dragon gains the following spell-like abilities upon reaching the listed age category. Its caster level for these effects is equal to its Hit Dice, and any save DCs are Charisma-based. A gold dragon can use these abilities at will. Very young-detect evil; Juvenile-bless; Adult-daylight; Old-geas/quest; Ancient-sunburst; Great wyrm-foresight. Weakening Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half ).

This armor lasts for a number of rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The sovereign dragon can dismiss the armor as a free action.  Master Counterspelling (Su) A great wyrm sovereign dragon can counterspell once per round as an immediate action. It need not know the spell it is countering, but can instead expend any spell that is one level higher to automatically counter the spell.  Violent Retort (Ex) When a young or older sovereign dragon takes damage from a melee attack critical hit, it can, as an immediate action, make a claw or tail slap attack against the creature that made the critical hit.

Read the Threads (Su) A time dragon gains a racial bonus on initiative checks equal to its age category. In addition, a time dragon is immune to the staggered condition.  Alien Presence (Su) A creature that fails its saving throw against a time dragon's alien presence is staggered for 5d6 rounds (or stunned if it has 4 Hit Dice or fewer).  Shifting Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of electricity, an old or older time dragon can use its breath weapon to displace creatures in time. Each creature in the cone must succeed at a Will save or be shifted forward in time a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the dragon's age category (DC equal to breath weapon). For an affected creature, it's as if no time passed. Creatures that succeed at their saves are staggered for 1 round.  Second Chance (Su) Three times per day as an immediate action, an ancient or older time dragon can force a creature (including itself) to reroll any d20 roll. The target must use the result of the second roll.  Time Travel (Su) Up to three times in its life, a great wyrm time dragon can travel to any point in time, taking with it a number of willing creatures equal to its Charisma modifier.

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 33; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. Spirit Blades (Su) As a swift action, an asurendra can call forth up to six longsword-shaped force effects that float near the asurendra until directed. The asurendra can use a standard action to direct one blade to attack a target up to a distance of 50 feet away, or use a full-attack action to cause all six blades to attack up to six different targets up to a distance of 50 feet away, each to a different location if desired. Once an asurendra directs a spirit blade to attack a foe, the blade continues to make a single attack against that foe each round on the asurendra's turn until directed otherwise by the asurendra and as long as the foe remains within 50 feet of the asurendra. As a move action, the asurendra can direct all currently attacking blades to switch targets to new foes within 50 feet. These weapons attack using the asurendra's base attack bonus modified by its Wisdom modifier (+29 for most asurendras), and deal 3d6 points of damage plus an amount of force damage equal to the asurendra's Wisdom modifier (3d6+7 for most asurendras). Physical attacks do no affect these blades, but disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation (touch AC 25) causes them to vanish. If a spirit blade's target dies or moves beyond a 50-foot range and the asurendra does not retarget that blade by the end of its turn, the blade vanishes. Likewise, any blades that are not within 50 feet of the asurendra at the end of its turn also vanish.

(20 ft. with whip)		Str 35, Dex 25, Con 36, Int 24, Wis 24, Cha 27	20	33	54	PFRPG Bestiary	Death Throes (Su) When killed, a balor explodes in a blinding flash of fire that deals 100 points of damage (half fire, half unholy damage) to anything within 100 feet (Reflex DC 33 halves). The save DC is Constitution-based. Entangle (Ex) If a balor strikes a Medium or smaller foe with its whip, the balor can immediately attempt a grapple check without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the balor wins the check, it draws the foe into an adjacent square. The foe gains the grappled condition, but the balor does not. Flaming Body (Su) A balor's body is covered in dancing flames. Anyone striking a balor with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a balor or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists. Vorpal Strike (Su) Any slashing weapon a balor wields (including its standard longsword and whip) gains the vorpal weapon quality. Weapons retain this quality for one hour after the balor releases the weapon, but after this the weapon reverts to its standard magical qualities, if any. Whip Mastery (Ex) A balor treats a whip as a light weapon for the purposes of two-weapon fighting, and can inflict lethal damage on a foe regardless of the foe's armor.

These determine the draconal's breath weapon, the additional energy damage of its claw and bite attacks, additional resistances and immunities, and its additional domain choices (see Spells, below).  Divine Insight (Su) A draconal adds its Charisma bonus as an insight bonus to Armor Class.  Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the draconal. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals draconal's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a draconal's stat block.)  Spells Draconals cast spells as 17th-level clerics. Like clerics, they have access to two domains, selecting from the following list: Air, Good, Nobility, Weather, and two additional domain options based on their color (see facing page). The majority of draconals choose Good and Nobility as their domains (as represented by this stat block). Draconals have a domain spell slot at each spell level but do not gain the granted powers of their chosen domains, nor do they gain access to other cleric abilities.

The residue is then absorbed into the dragon's body. An assimilated creature can only be restored to life using wish, miracle, or true resurrection, but even then, there is a 50% chance that such powerful magic fails. Breath Weapon (Su) An elemental earth dragon's breath weapon is a 50 ft. cone of scorching sand and gravel. Earth Mastery (Ex) An elemental earth dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foes are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental earth dragon takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the stat block.) Freeze (Ex) An elemental earth dragon can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice that the elemental earth dragon is really alive. Meld into Stone (Ex) An elemental earth dragon can meld its body with any stone surface large enough to accommodate its entire body. This is a standard action and has an unlimited duration (the dragon can stay melded as long as it desires). It otherwise resembles the meld into stone spell (caster level 20th).																												
Eremite	20.00	307200	Medium	12	38, touch 19, flat-footed 29	310	22	16	19		31		40 ft., fly 60 ft.

Evisceration (Ex) When an eremite grapples a foe, it can quickly eviscerate or otherwise surgically alter its victim by excising a bit of flesh or a part of an internal organ as a swift action, causing the victim to take 1d8 points of ability drain-the exact ability score drained is chosen by the eremite. The victim can resist this effect with a DC 28 Fortitude save. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Graft Flesh (Su) Once per day, an eremite may graft any bit of flesh or bone harvested via its evisceration ability within the previous hour to its own body as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Doing so grants the eremite the effects of a heal and a greater restoration spell (caster level 20th).  Pain (Su) Any creature struck by an eremite's natural attacks must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round from the pain. As long as a creature is staggered by this effect, it takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made to resist the eremite's spell-like and extraordinary abilities. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Shadow Traveler (Ex) When an eremite uses plane shift to travel to the Plane of Shadow, it arrives at its intended destination with complete accuracy. When an eremite uses shadow walk, it moves at a rate of 100 miles per hour.  Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an eremite's unnerving gaze becomes paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds as it finds itself almost longing to submit its flesh to the kyton. At the end of any round it remains paralyzed in this way, the victim must make a DC 31 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain from encroaching madness. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.																												
Great Wyrm Copper Dragon	20.00	307200	Gargantuan	3	42, touch 5, flat-footed 42	391	23	16	22	uncanny dodge	31		40 ft., fly 250 ft.

Deadly Joke (Sp) Once per day, as a standard action, a great wyrm copper dragon can tell a joke that kills. This affects one target, and functions as power word kill. This is a language-dependent sonic effect.  Mass Laughter (Sp) An ancient copper dragon can tell a fantastic joke once per day as a standard action. All creatures within 10 feet per age category must make a Will save or laugh for 1 round per age category, as if affected by hideous laughter. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is equal to a 6th-level spell.  Slow Aura (Su) An old or older copper dragon is surrounded by an aura of slowness. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon must make a Will save or be affected as per slow for 1 round. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. For great wyrm copper dragons, those opponents that fail their saves are slowed for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. A copper dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.  Slow Breath (Su) Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell slow) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.  Trap Master (Ex) A juvenile or older copper dragon receives a +1 bonus per age category on Craft (traps) and Perception checks made to locate a trap. Upon becoming a mature adult, he can also use Disable Device to disarm magic traps as if he had the rogue's Trapfinding class feature.

These treants can be called from any Huge or larger living tree. A green dragon can create a single treant as a standard action, up to a total of 4 treants per day. These treants remain animated for up to 1 hour, at which time they revert to being ordinary trees.  Camouflage (Ex) An old or older green dragon can use Stealth to hide in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment.  Miasma (Su) An ancient or older green dragon can use its breath weapon to create a cloud of acid as a standard action that deals damage to any creature inside it. The cloud moves with the dragon and has a radius of 20 feet. When it's created, anyone inside this area takes an amount of damage equal to half the dragon's breath weapon, with a Reflex save for half damage. The number of damage dice rolled is halved each round until the result would be less than 1d6. Any creature that starts its turn inside the cloud takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. A strong wind, such as that created by a gust of wind, disperses the cloud in 1 round.  Trackless Step (Ex) An adult or older green dragon does not leave a trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. A green dragon can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires.  Water Breathing (Ex) A green dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.  Woodland Stride (Ex) A very young or older green dragon can move through any sort of foliage at full speed without taking damage or suffering impairment. Areas of foliage that have been magically manipulated affect it normally.																												
Grim Reaper	20.00	307200	Large	6	32, touch 20, flat-footed 30	378	18	11	20	channel resistance +4, incorporeal	31		40 ft., fly 60 ft. (perfect)	#ERROR!		10 ft.	15 ft.		Str 24, Dex 15, Con -, Int 16, Wis 19, Cha 29	21	24	50 (can't be tripped)	AP 48	Death Touch (Su) Creatures hit by either a grim reaper's touch attack or by a weapon wielded by a grim reaper must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or gain 2d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based. A grim reaper can channel this ability through any weapon it wields. A humanoid slain by a reaper's death touch is consumed in unholy fire and has its remains destroyed as the destruction spell. This is a death effect.  Summon Minor Reapers (Sp) Three times per day, a reaper can summon 1d4 minor reapers as a standard action. Each of these minor reapers is assigned a single creature to attack, and the targeted creature must battle the minor reaper by itself. The target that the grim reaper assigns to its minor reapers need not be in sight, but it must be on the same plane on which the minor reaper was summoned. A grim reaper may only assign one minor reaper to any creature at a given time, even if it uses this ability multiple times.																												
Iathavos	20.00	307200	Colossal	-1	37, touch 7, flat-footed 37	372	28	15	28	ichor, never surprised or flat-footed	31		20 ft., fly 50 ft. (perfect)	2 claws +31 (4d6+15/19-20 plus grab), 4 wings +26 (2d8+7)		30 ft.	30 ft.	abyssal transformation, entropic beams, horrific appearance (DC 30)	Str 40, Dex 8, Con 31, Int 29, Wis 30, Cha 27	24	+47 (+51 grapple)	62 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Abyssal Transformation (Su) If an iathavos establishes a hold on a creature of Large or smaller size, it can place that creature deep within the bristly folds of its flesh. Treat this as an engulf attack (see page 296), except that at the start of the iathavos's turn, an engulfed creature must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or be transformed into a nyogoth qlippoth that immediately squirms out of the iathavos's body to serve its new master. Creatures transformed into nyogoths are not controlled by the iathavos, but function and behave as if they were typical members of that species-they retain no memories or abilities they may have possessed in their previous lives. Items held or worn by the unfortunate victim remain lodged within the folds of the iathavos's body and can only be retrieved if the iathavos is helpless or dead. A creature transformed into a nyogoth in this manner can be restored to its true shape via break enchantment, miracle, or wish. Otherwise, slaying the nyogoth allows the poor soul to be restored to life via reincarnation, resurrection, or true resurrection. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Entropic Beams (Su) As a standard action once every minute, an iathavos can fire beams of entropic energy from its 10 eyes. Each of these beams of energy can be directed at a single target within 300 feet of the iathavos, but no more than one beam may be directed at any one creature. Beams that are not directed at a creature are wasted. The qlippoth must make a +15 ranged touch attack to hit with each beam. Each beam has the same effect as a CL 20th disintegrate (40d6 damage, DC 32 Fortitude partial for 5d6 damage), except a creature killed by this damage explodes in a 5-foot burst of energy, flesh, shadow, and smoke instead of turning into dust. Any creature in this burst must make a DC 32 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to the iathavos's horrific appearance are affected by a feeblemind effect and permanently blinded.  Ichor (Su) As long as the iathavos has taken any hit point damage, thick and stringy ropes of black ichor weep from the fissures and folds in its bristly hide. This ichor extrudes from the creature's body in a writhing nimbus of filaments at a rate of 5 feet per round, to a maximum range equal to its reach (30 feet). At the start the iathavos's turn, all creatures in reach of these strands of ichor must make a DC 32 Reflex save or become entangled. At the start the iathavos's turn, all creatures entangled by the ichor take 4d6 points of acid damage. If the qlippoth ends its turn with no hit point damage, the ichor melts away into harmless mist, releasing all entangled creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stench (Su) The iathavos's stench ability is supernaturally disgusting-creatures that succumb to this ability are nauseated, while those that save are still sickened.																												
Jinushigami	20.00	307200	Gargantuan	11	34, touch 14, flat-footed 26	348	25	17	23		31		50 ft., burrow 40 ft.	#ERROR!		20 ft.	20 ft.		Str 28, Dex 25, Con 28, Int 23, Wis 24, Cha 31	24	+37 (+39 bull rush or overrun)	55 (57 vs. bull rush or overrun)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Infused Quarterstaff (Su) Any quarterstaff a jinushigami wields  functions as a +5 quarterstaff (unless the quarterstaff already has a greater enhancement bonus). If a jinushigami is within its regional ward, it can create a Gargantuan quarterstaff out of the surrounding terrain as a standard action.  Manipulate Terrain (Su) A jinushigami can help any number of creatures travel within its territory. Creatures aided in this way receive a +10 bonus on Survival checks and do not suffer reductions to overland movement from terrain or lack of a highway or other roadway, regardless of the presence of roads or the type of terrain they actually travel through. Alternatively, a jinushigami can make terrain more difficult for any number of creatures to travel through, imparting a -10 penalty on all Survival checks and causing overland movement to be reduced to one-tenth its normal speed. A jinushigami can affect as many creatures as it wishes with this ability, selecting whether it aids or impedes travel for each, as long as it can notice the creature and the creature is within its regional ward. A jinushigami may use this ability while merged with its ward.  Ward (Su) A jinushigami treats an entire region as its ward. This region can be a single forest, swamp, mountain, lake, or any other natural feature, with a maximum radius of 5 miles. Most jinushigami have smaller regional wards, since not all regions are large enough to fill this area, but no region with a radius smaller than 1 mile radius can support (or deserves) a jinushigami. As long as it is within its territory (either merged with it or in its physical form), a jinushigami can observe the world from any point within its regional ward as if it were at that point. While merged with its ward, it can observe all points simultaneously in this way. As a standard action, it can convey information about a creature within its ward (effectively imparting a description and exact location) to all kami within its regional ward.																												
Lhaksharut	20.00	307200	Huge	5	36, touch 18, flat-footed 35	337	25	12	22	constructed	31		fly 60 ft. (perfect)	#ERROR!	2 energy bolts +21 (10d6 energy)	15 ft.	15 ft.	cunning reflexes, multiweapon mastery, wounding weapons	Str 31, Dex 13, Con 26, Int 14, Wis 21, Cha 20	22	34	50 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Cunning Reflexes (Ex) A lhaksharut uses its Wisdom modifier, rather than its Dexterity modifier, to determine how many additional attacks of opportunity it gains with the Combat Reflexes feat. For most lhaksharut inevitables, this benefit equates to 5 additional attacks of opportunity per round.  Energy Bolt (Su) A lhaksharut can fire bolts of elemental energy from two of its six arms-it never wields weapons in these hands. These attacks have a range increment of 100 feet and deal 10d6 energy damage of the inevitable's choice (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen for each bolt as it is thrown). It can throw two bolts of energy as a standard action, and cannot attack with these hands when it makes weapon or slam attacks with its other limbs.  Immunity to Energy Spells (Ex) A lhaksharut is immune to any spell or spell-like ability with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor that allows spell resistance.  Multiweapon Mastery (Ex) A lhaksharut never takes penalties on its attack rolls when fighting with multiple weapons.  Perfect Prediction (Su) A lhaksharut gains an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus.  Wounding Weapons (Su) Any weapon wielded by a lhaksharut gains the wounding weapon quality as long as it remains in the creature's grasp.																												
Maharaja	20.00	307200	Medium	13	37, touch 24, flat-footed 27	310	16	21	18		35		40 ft., fly 30 ft.

The maharaja acts normally on the higher of the two initiative counts each round. On the lower initiative count, the maharaja can take a single standard action.  Spells A maharaja casts arcane spells as an 18th-level sorcerer.																												
Mortuary Cyclone	20.00	307200	Huge	5	28, touch 13, flat-footed 27	263	20	17	24		31		40 ft.	slam +33 (2d8+16/19-20 plus energy drain)		15 ft.	15 ft.	create spawn, energy drain (2 levels, DC 29), necrocone, whirlwind (10-40 ft. high, 3d6 damage, DC 36),	Str 33, Dex 12, Con -, Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 19	23	36	49	Tome of Horrors Complete	Create Spawn (Su) Any living creature slain by a mortuary cyclone's necrocone attack or energy drain attack becomes an undead creature in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the mortuary cyclone that created them and remain enslaved until its destruction. See the sidebar for the type of undead creatures a mortuary cyclone can spawn.  Desecrating Aura (Su) A mortuary cyclone emanates an aura of desecration within a 50-foot radius centered on its body.  This functions as a desecrate spell (caster level 18th) as if the mortuary cyclone where a permanent fixture dedicated to its own deity. Clerics in the area take a -6 profane penalty on turning checks, undead within the area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves, and undead created within the area have +2 hit points per HD. Further, anyone casting animate dead within 50 feet of a mortuary cyclone creates as many as double the normal amount of undead (4 HD per caster level instead of 2 HD per caster level).  A consecrate spell cast on a mortuary cyclone by a caster of 18th level or higher nullifies its desecrating aura for 1 minute per caster level.  Necrocone (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a mortuary cyclone can blast forth a mass of bone fragments, debris and negative energy in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take 6d6 points of damage. Half this damage is piercing damage, but the other half is from negative energy and is not subject to resistance or immunity (unless the opponent is resistant or immune to negative energy effects). An affected creature that succeeds on a DC 27 Reflex save reduces the piercing damage by half. Undead within the area of a necrocone heal a number of hit points equal to the amount of negative energy damage (3d6) the attack would otherwise deal. An undead creature cannot gain temporary or bonus hit points from a mortuary cyclone's necrocone. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Unholy Grace (Su) A mortuary cyclone adds its Charisma modifier as a bonus on its saving throws and as a profane bonus to its Armor Class. (The statistics block already reflects these bonuses.)																												
Moxix	20.00	307200	Gargantuan	3	34, touch 9, flat-footed 31	379	24	10	22	gush			40 ft.	bite +29 (2d8+10/19-20), gore +29 (2d8+10), 4 slams +29 (2d6+10/19-20 plus grab)		20 ft.	20 ft.	breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 16d6 acid damage plus disease, Reflex DC 32 halves, usable every 1d4 rounds), constrict (2d6+10), rend (2 slams, 2d6+15)	Str 30, Dex 17, Con 32, Int 15, Wis 24, Cha 25	23	+37 (+41 grapple)	50	Inner Sea Bestiary	Breath Weapon (Su) Moxix can exhale a cone of acidic fog laced with a terrible disease. Any creature damaged by the acid of his breath weapon must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or contract this disease. A humanoid afflicted with this disease must attempt a new Will save each day. If the humanoid fails, it attacks and attempts to eat the weakest humanoid nearby. If the save is successful, it resists this impulse. A humanoid who dies or is killed while afflicted rises as a ghast at the next midnight. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Moxix's Delectation: Inhaled; save Fortitude DC 28; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Wis damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Gush (Ex) Anytime Moxix takes more than 50 points of weapon damage in a round, blood and pus spews forth from the wound. The blood is extremely slippery and sprays out in a 20-foot radius, coating all creatures and surfaces in the area. Any creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 28 Reflex save or drop any items they are holding. A saving throw must be made each round that the creature attempts to use or pick up an item it previously dropped. In addition, the area coated in the gushing blood is difficult to move about in, and creatures moving through the area must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics check or fall prone.  Hopedrinker (Su) Moxix emits an aura that drains hope from all within 60 feet. All morale bonuses are suppressed within this aura, regardless of their source. In addition, spells and spell-like abilities granting a morale bonus are affected as dispel magic used to counterspell (caster level 23rd) every round at the beginning of Moxix's turn. A successful dispel check negates the entire effect (not just the morale bonus) and grants Moxix temporary hit points equal to the spell's level (to a maximum of 100). These temporary hit points last 1 hour.  Mindshatter (Su) If a creature fails its save against Moxix's eyebite spell-like ability, as a standard action before the end of his turn he may unravel the target's mind and spirit. This acts as greater dispel magic (caster level 23rd) against effects that protect against mind-affecting or necromantic effects and automatically affects the target as enervation and touch of idiocy (duration 24 hours).

Delirious Breath (Su) Creatures who fail their saves against the dragon's breath weapon are either confused or nauseated for 1 round. The dragon chooses which effect to apply when it uses its breath weapon, and it can use only one effect per breath.  Water Breathing (Ex) A green dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

For items made primarily of crystal, stone, or earth, this time and the item's cost to create are halved.  Secret of the Vault Seed (Su) Mythic xiomorns possess an innate understanding of Vault Seeds-the magic-rich artifacts that grow into the xiomorns' underground vaults. This process includes finding the raw crystals the seeds are formed from on the Plane of Earth, faceting the gem and using magic to grow it into its shape, and nurturing the seed with the proper spells once it's planted in the raw earth from which the Vault will grow.  A mythic xiomorn gains regeneration 10 while in a Vault it created or directly helped create. No attack form causes this regeneration to stop functioning; a mythic xiomorn can be killed by hit point damage only if removed from its Vault first.  Xiomorn Spellcasting (Su) This ability functions as simple arcane spellcasting, except that the xiomorn can change its spells each morning as though preparing spells, choosing a number of spells with a combined level equal to twice its CR. Each xiomorn knows a number of spells with a combined level equal to three times its CR-choosing from the spells listed above, as well as create demiplaneUM, mythic move earth, and terraformMA.																												
Nightwave	20.00	307200	Colossal	7	36, touch 5, flat-footed 33	391	18	16	25		29	light aversion	fly 60 ft.

All waters within 60 feet are completely dark (as deeper darkness), and creatures within this radius take 6d6 points of damage (half cold, half bludgeoning) at the end of their turn each round if they remain in the area at this time. A DC 31 Fortitude save negates the crushing damage. Incorporeal creatures and creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes native to deep waters do not take this damage, and freedom of movement protects completely against the damage. Any magical light effect within this radius at the beginning of the nightwave's turn is dispelled (treat as greater dispel magic). This effect does not extend out of the water. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Energy Drain (Su) A creature that has been swallowed whole by a nightwave gains 2 negative levels each round.																												
Olethrodaemon	20.00	307200	Gargantuan	12	38, touch 18, flat-footed 30	370	29	18	26		31		40 ft., burrow 50 ft.	2 bites +28 (2d8+12/19-20 plus grab), 4 claws +28 (2d6+12 plus grab), gore +28 (2d8+12)		20 ft.	20 ft.	drain soul, soul-drained breath, trample (2d8+18, DC 32)	Str 35, Dex 26, Con 37, Int 12, Wis 26, Cha 25	20	+36 (+40 grapple)	54 (58 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Adamantine Claws (Ex) Able to tear through stone, an olethrodaemon's claws are treated as though they were adamantine. This ability also allows an olethrodaemon to make use of its burrow speed through stone.  Drain Soul (Su) A creature grappled by an olethrodaemon's grab attack from its claws can be transferred to its mouth as a move action requiring no combat maneuver check. As a standard action, an olethrodaemon that begins its turn with an opponent grappled in either of its mouths can swallow the opponent by succeeding on another grapple check. If successful, the creature is swallowed into one of the olethrodaemon's many stomachs. These stomachs grind their contents and drain the life force from living creatures. Every round a creature remains in an olethrodaemon's stomach, it takes 4d8+18 points of damage and gains 1d4 negative levels. The creature can attempt to cut its way out of the olethrodaemon's stomach, but it suffers the chance of just cutting into another stomach chamber. An olethrodaemon's stomach is AC 20 and has 40 hit points. Once a creature deals enough damage to allow escape, it has a 50% chance to end up in another stomach chamber instead of escaping. Due to the multiple stomach chambers, an olethrodaemon can house and drain up to four medium creatures at one time. This ability otherwise functions as the swallow whole special attack. It is a DC 33 Fortitude save to remove negative levels gained in this fashion. This save is Constitution-based.  Soul-Drained Breath (Su) An olethrodaemon can convert life energy it has consumed into a potent breath weapon. Up to three times per day, but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, an olethrodaemon can expel a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone of shrieking black smoke and wind from one of its mouths as a standard action. Any living creature in the area of this attack takes 20d10 points of damage from negative energy, or half on a successful DC 27 Reflex save. Undead creatures caught in this negative energy are healed for the same amount instead of damaged. The save DC for this effect is Charisma-based.																												
Pit Fiend	20.00	307200	Large	13	38, touch 18, flat-footed 29	350	24	21	18		31		40 ft., fly 60 ft. (average)	2 claws +32 (2d8+13), 2 wings +30 (2d6+6), bite +32 (4d6+13 plus poison and disease), tail slap +30 (2d8+6 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	constrict 2d8+19, devil shaping	Str 37, Dex 29, Con 35, Int 26, Wis 30, Cha 26	20	+34 (+38 grapple)	53	PFRPG Bestiary	Devil Shaping (Su) Three times per day, a pit fiend can spend a minute to transform nearby lemures into other lesser devils. A pit fiend can transform one lemure for every Hit Die the pit fiend possesses. It can then reshape these lemures into a number of Hit Dice's worth of lesser devils (see page 71) equal to the number of lemures affected. For example, a typical 20 Hit Dice pit fiend could transform 20 lemures into two bone devils (10 HD each), or three bearded devils (6 HD each, leaving two lemures unchanged), or any other combination of lesser devils. Lemures to be reshaped must be within 50 feet of the pit fiend, becoming stationary and unable to move once the shaping begins. After a minute passes, the lemures reform into the shape of a new lesser devil ready to follow the orders of the pit fiend. Although pit fiends can, technically, elevate a mass of 20 lemures into a new pit fiend, most are hesitant to do so since they have no special control over a devil created in this manner. Disease (Su) Devil Chills: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 32; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d6 Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Pleroma	20.00	307200	Large	12	36, touch 24, flat-footed 27	324	24	18	26		31		0 ft., fly 60 ft. (perfect)	touch +30 (20d8 energy)		10 ft.	10 ft.	sphere of creation, sphere of oblivion	Str 24, Dex 27, Con 26, Int 26, Wis 31, Cha 25	24	32	57 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 2	Energy Touch (Su) A pleroma's touch deals 20d8 points of damage from positive or negative energy, depending upon which type of energy would harm the creature touched. A pleroma's touch never heals damage.  Spells A pleroma casts spells as a 20th-level cleric, but does not have access to domains. A pleroma can cast certain sorcerer/wizard spells as divine spells.  Sphere of Creation (Su) Three times per day, the pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere of white energy that hovers above its left hand. By concentrating, the pleroma can control this sphere, causing it to fly slowly at a speed of 10 feet per round. The sphere can travel in any direction, but must remain within 300 feet of the pleroma or it immediately dissipates. Wherever the sphere travels, it leaves behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either new terrain (such as swamp, tundra, desert, or forest) or a 10-foot-square wall composed of a single natural substance (such as clay, wood, or stone). Any existing matter, either living or nonliving that comes in contact with the sphere must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or be absorbed and incorporated into the new substance (only freedom, miracle, or wish can rescue creatures so trapped). Creatures that save are pushed to the nearest unoccupied location adjacent to the newly created substance. The sphere is highly unstable and only lasts 1d4 minutes before exploding with a blinding flash. All creatures within 30 feet of the flash must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Sphere of Oblivion (Su) Three times per day, the pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere of complete and utter darkness that hovers above its right hand. The sphere is an empty void similar to a sphere of annihilation. Any matter (living or nonliving) that touches the sphere must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be sucked into the sphere and destroyed. Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot cube per round of contact with the sphere. By concentrating, the pleroma can control this sphere, causing it to fly slowly at a speed of 10 feet per round. The sphere can travel in any direction, but must remain within 300 feet of the pleroma or it immediately dissipates. The sphere is highly unstable and only lasts 1d4 minutes before harmlessly imploding upon itself. Alternatively, the pleroma may hurl the sphere as a ranged touch attack (with a 10-foot range increment) against a single creature. When thrown in this manner, the sphere implodes immediately after the attack is resolved. The save DCs are Constitution-based.																												
Quantium Golem	20.00	307200	Gargantuan	-2	37, touch 4, flat-footed 37	375	10	8	10				20 ft.	#ERROR!		20 ft.	20 ft.	eldritch surge	Str 40, Dex 7, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1	30	49	57	Inner Sea Bestiary	Eldritch Surge (Su) A Quantium golem can hurl a lance of eldritch energy that deals 30d6 points of damage to all creatures in a 240-foot line (Reflex DC 25 for half). The crimson Quantium golem deals half electricity and half fire damage, and slows a creature (as the slow spell) that fails its save for 2d4 rounds. The green Quantium golem deals half acid and half fire damage, and nauseates any creature that fails its save for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A Quantium golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted.  • A magical attack that deals cold damage against the crimson golem or electricity damage against the green golem slows it (as the slow spell) for 1 round, with no saving throw.  • A Quantium golem and its equipment are immune to rust attacks.  Link (Su) Each Quantium golem always knows the exact location of the other.  Urban Defender (Su) A Quantium golem gains 150 bonus hit points as long as it's within 1 mile of the city. If it moves beyond this range, it loses these bonus hit points.																												
Quantum	20.00	307200	Huge	8	32, touch 15, flat-footed 28	357	18	17	23	unstable form			fly 40 ft.

If it hits, it sets up subatomic vibrations that shake apart the molecular structure of its opponent. The target must succeed on a DC 32 Fortitude save or take 40d6 points of damage. Even if the save succeeds, the target takes 10d6 points of damage. This effect functions as a disintegrate spell (CL 34th). A quantum can use this ability when it uses its quantum form. Each use by one of its forms counts against its daily use limit. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Quantum Form (Su) Three times per day and once per round, a quantum can move in such a way as to appear in two places at once, at a distance no greater than 30 feet.  This is a free action that provokes an attack of opportunity and lasts only one round. While occupying two spaces simultaneously, each representation of the quantum can perform one independent standard action (including using the quantum's special attacks). Using this ability, the same quantum could attack two different opponents, or attack one opponent while opening a door to escape, and so on.  At the end of the round, both instances of the quantum return to the space it originally occupied before activating this ability.  Quantum Movement (Su) At will a quantum can use the dimension door spell as a standard action (CL 34th).  Unstable Form (Su) A quantum has a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to its Charisma bonus. Further, because it moves by means of short-distance teleportation, attacks aimed at a quantum have a 20% miss chance.

Against such effects it is considered to automatically make any required saving throws.  Energy Resistance (Ex) A Ravager spawn possesses energy resistance against all forms of energy attack (fire, cold, electricity, acid, and sonic).  Form-Shifting (Ex) A Ravager spawn can physically alter its physiology to take on one of the three listed forms: the crawler, the brawler, or the flier. Doing so takes one minute, and during this period it cannot take any other actions, though it is not considered helpless.  Magic Disruption (Su) Every time a Ravager spawn comes into contact with a spell or spell-like or supernatural effect, there is a chance as indicated above that the magic does not affect it. In the case of ongoing effects, a new check is made each round.  Regeneration (Ex) A Ravager spawn treats all damage as subdual, except damage from epic-level weapons and artifacts.  Vampiric Healing (Su) Whenever a Ravager spawn hits with a melee attack, it is healed hit points equal to half the damage it inflicts on its opponent. This ability cannot heal it above its natural maximum hit points. This ability extends to its trample special attack, where applicable.

Creatures within 50 feet that hear this grinding roar must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be deafened for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Intense Heat (Ex) A slag worm's body generates intense heat. Anything within 10 feet of its body takes 4d6 points of fire damage each round. A DC 30 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Any weapon that strikes a slag worm must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or melt into slag.  (Magic weapons gain their enhancement bonus to their save.) A creature striking a slag worm with a natural attack or unarmed takes the same 4d6 points of damage each time an attack hits. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  Fire Absorption (Ex) Fire deals no damage to a slag worm. Instead, the slag worm absorbs the effect and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points the effect would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the slag worm to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.  Susceptible to Rust (Ex) Attacks that cause rusting (such as a rusting grasp spell or the touch of a rust monster) deal 2d6 points of damage to a slag worm.																												
Star-Spawn Of Cthulhu	20.00	307200	Huge	5	36, touch 9, flat-footed 35	362	18	9	25	immortality, overwhelming mind	31		40 ft., fly 60 ft.

Only violence can bring about the death of one of these creatures.  Limited Starflight (Ex) A star-spawn of Cthulhu can survive in the void of outer space, and its wings allow it to use its fly speed in outer space despite the lack of air. Unlike full starflight (like that of the mi-go; see page 193), a star-spawn of Cthulhu's ability to fly in outer space does not allow it to reach unusual speeds. When it wishes to fly to another world, the creature relies entirely upon its immortality and patience to complete the journey. When speed is required, it instead uses its gate ability to make the journey quickly.  Overwhelming Mind (Ex) A star-spawn of Cthulhu's mind is overwhelming in its power and alien structure. The first time a creature other than an outsider (excluding native outsiders) or aberration makes mental contact with a star-spawn of Cthulhu, it must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the creature is merely staggered for 1 round. This effect can occur whether the star-spawn of Cthulhu initiates mental contact (such as via a demand, dream, nightmare, or sending spell-like ability, or once per round merely by telepathic communication) or another creature attempts to do so (such as via detect thoughts or dominate monster). Once a creature is exposed to a specific star-spawn of Cthulhu's overwhelming mind, it is immune to this effect from all star-spawn of Cthulhu for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

It cannot be flanked.  Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a tarn linnorm can expel a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone of acid, dealing 22d8 points of acid damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 32 halves). This acid creates toxic fumes when it consumes organic material-on the round after a creature takes acid damage from this attack, it must make a DC 32 Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of Strength damage from the poisonous fumes (this secondary effect is a poison effect). As a full-round action, the linnorm may breathe acid with one head and bite with the other (but not use its other weapons). Alternatively, as a full-round action, it can breathe acid from both heads to create two adjacent 60-foot-long cones or two separate 120-foot-long lines. In this case it cannot use its breath weapon again for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Death Curse (Su) When a creature slays a tarn linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse of death.  Curse of Death: save Will DC 29; effect creature can no longer be affected by healing spells and does not heal damage naturally from rest. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Freedom of Movement (Ex) A tarn linnorm is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.  Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 6d6 acid damage and 1d8 Con drain; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitutuion-based.

This water jet has a range of 240 feet with no range increment. A target hit by the water jet is subject to the behemoth's push ability and must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or be stunned  for 1d4+1 rounds.

The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or lose any ability it had to reproduce or bear children. This effect can only be removed by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Creatures that magically reproduce are not affected by this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Rebirth (Su) Once per day, a veranallia can reincarnate a creature she deems worthy of the honor. The creature's original body decays and sinks into the ground, affecting the surrounding area in a 1/2-mile radius as though with plant growth (enrichment). Over the course of 1d4 days, a white, flowery cocoon emerges from the affected ground and splits open, revealing the newly reincarnated creature inside. Creatures reincarnated by a veranallia always return to life as aasimars. This ability otherwise functions as the reincarnate spell.  Spells Veranallias cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics and have access to some druid spells. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.  Winter Sickle (Ex) At will as a free action, a veranallia can create a jagged blade from her hoarfrost-covered vines that acts as a +3 icy burst sickle. One round after it leaves the veranallia's grasp, the weapon melts into a small puddle of water.

Void Form (Su) A void yai may become incorporeal as a swift action. In this form, it appears as a solid black shadow of its true form. It gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal defensive ability while in void form. Any gear or armor the yai carries becomes incorporeal as well-it loses its AC bonus from armor and natural armor, but gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier (+7 for most void yai, for an AC of 16). It may still speak while incorporeal and can still use its spell-like and special abilities.  Void Missile (Su) As a swift action, a void yai can launch a bolt of darkness from its third eye. Damage caused by this missile is negative energy damage. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment.  Void Trap (Su) When a void oni uses any teleportation effect on itself (including its greater teleport and plane shift spell-like abilities, but not its teleport object spell-like ability), it can choose to arrive at its destination in void form as a free action. When it does so, it leaves behind a temporary lesser sphere of annihilation in a square of its choice that was part of its space before it teleported. This sphere of annihilation cannot be caused to move by other creatures, but the sphere itself moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) toward the closest Tiny or larger creature on the oni's next turn. If no appropriate creature is within 30 feet, the sphere does not move that round. If the sphere enters a square occupied by a creature (or if a creature touches the sphere), that creature is affected as if by a disintegrate spell (CL 20th, DC 23). Once the sphere damages a creature with this effect, the sphere vanishes-it also vanishes on its own after 24 hours in the unlikely event that it never discharges on a creature. The save DC is Charisma-based.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6.  Manipulate Flames (Su) An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires.  Melt Stone (Su) An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.  Smoke Vision (Ex) A very young red dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics).

Creatures in the breath weapon's area take 16d6 points of slashing damage and are nauseated for 1d4 rounds (Reflex 30 halves damage and negates nausea). The scavengers persist as a swarm around the affected creature that is closest to the breath weapon's point of origin; this swarm has the same statistics as an army ant swarm, but its distraction DC is the same as the yamaraj's breath weapon DC. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Final Judgment (Su) A yamaraj can only use its miracle spell-like ability to restore a slain outsider to life or to reproduce the following spell effects: banishment, dimensional anchor, greater restoration, plane shift, true resurrection.  Lightning Drinker (Su) A yamaraj absorbs electricity to strengthen itself. If struck by an electrical attack, it heals 1 hit point per 3 points of electricity damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the yamaraj to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points (up to a maximum of 100), which last up to 1 hour.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 30; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex drain; cure 3 consecutive saves.

Electricity Aura (Su) A great wyrm blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn.  Mirage (Su) A great wyrm blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for 28 rounds per day. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage.  Sandstorm (Su) As a standard action, a great wyrm blue dragon can create a sandstorm centered on itself with a radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the dragon inside the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition to the normal sandstorm penalties (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431). This sandstorm lasts for up to 1 hour, but can be dismissed by the dragon as a free action.  Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.  Storm Breath (Su) A wyrm blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions as call lightning storm but the damage is 24d8. The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is 32. Additional uses of this ability extend the duration by an additional 1d6 rounds.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will.  Repulsion Breath (Su) Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.  Tidal Wave (Su) A great wyrm bronze dragon can cause the sea to rise up and crush his enemies once per day as a standard action. This affects an area of coastline 120 feet in length and targets all creatures within 40 feet of the shore-treat the targets as if struck by an avalanche. Treat all creatures as if they were in the bury zone. The save DC to halve this damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Those who fail their saves take full damage and are drawn 60 feet off shore and deposited 20 feet under the surface on the round after the wave hits.  Vortex (Ex) Once per day, an ancient or older bronze dragon can create a vortex as a standard action, just like an elder water elemental. A bronze dragon can maintain this vortex for 1 round per age category.  Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.  Wave Mastery (Su) For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.

Siege Tower (Ex) An iron colossus's ballistae don't provoke attacks of opportunity, and they reload themselves at the start of the colossus's turn.

A creature that saves against the julunggali's aura is immune to it for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex or Su) A julunggali has three different poisons. Each time it bites, it decides which poison to inject. Julunggali Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 30; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con or 1d6 Dex or age one age category (julunggali's choice); cure 2 consecutive saves.

Str 36, Dex 25, Con 33, Int 25, Wis 25, Cha 26	20	34	59	Tome of Horrors Complete	Bone Knit (Su) Each time a living creature is hit by a weapon wielded by Maphistal, it must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage as its bones fuse together. Creatures without bones or skeletal structures (such as oozes and plants) are immune to this effect.  Disease (Ex) Demon Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 31; onset 1day, frequency 1 day, effect 1d6 Con damage and target must make a second Fort save or 1 point of the damage is Con drain instead, cure 2 consecutive saves.  Vox: Maphistal's unique weapon is a +3 unholy crushing heavy mace. The crushing special quality crushes the skulls of those it strikes. Upon a successful critical hit, the weapon crushes the opponent's skull (if it has one) instantly killing the target. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no skulls, others, such as golems and incorporeal undead, are not affected by the crushing special quality. Most other creatures, however, die when their skull is crushed.

A mu spore can use these tendrils to attempt a grab as an immediate action when an adjacent creature hits it with a melee attack. As it is only using the tendrils (instead of conducting the grapple normally), it takes a -20 penalty to its CMB to make and maintain the grapple (+31 CMB with tendrils). The mu spore does not gain the grappled condition while grappling a creature with its tendrils.  Spore Cough (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a mu spore can release a cloud of burrowing spores in a 100- foot cone. The burrowing spores deal 20d8 points of damage to all creatures and wooden structures in the area, or half damage to any creatures that make a DC 34 Reflex save. Plants and plant creatures are immune to this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

She can expend two uses of mythic power as an immediate action to add the dancing special ability to all her manufactured weapons for 4 rounds.  Poisoned Weapons (Ex) As a swift action, a mythic marilith can lick one of her manufactured weapons to coat it with deathblade poison (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558).

Sonechard can take control of undead creatures controlled by another creature whose caster level is 19 or less by making a successful opposed Charisma check against the opponent's Charisma check.  Undead Master (Ex) This ability allows Sonechard to create a maximum of 50 HD of undead with a single use of animate dead.

The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the leviathan's size, the leviathan takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.  Stygian Poisoning (Su) The Stygian leviathan's stomach contains large quantities of water from the River Styx. Each round a swallowed opponent must succeed at a DC Swim or the swallowed creature slips underwater. Thereafter they must make a successful DC Fortitude save each round or be affected as by a feeblemind spell.

One round after this breath weapon is used, the area affected by the attack becomes covered in a cloud of thick, scorching smoke that burns both the lungs and eyes, dealing an additional 8d8 points of fire damage to all creatures in the area. Each creature that begins its turn in the smoke-covered area and breathes must make a DC 33 (+ 1 per previous check) Fortitude save each round or spend that round choking and coughing. Creatures that keep their eyes open for more than 1 round while in the area of the smoke must make a DC 33 Fortitude save or go blind for 1d3 hours. The smoke dissipates after 2d4 rounds. This duration is halved in strong winds and quartered in more powerful winds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Death Curse (Su) Curse of Boiling Blood: save Will DC 31; effect creature gains vulnerability to fire and is permanently staggered from the pain of its boiling blood. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A successful save reduces the ability score damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Demonbrand: Vepar's unique weapon is a Large +2 trident that can cast magic missiles seven times per day as a swift action (CL 15th). Additionally, the wielder can cast waves of fatigue once per day (CL 15th).																												
Zelishkar	21.00	409600	Large	5	39, touch 13, flat-footed 35	396	19	19	20	blur (20% miss chance)	32	vulnerable to cold	30 ft., fly 60 ft.

In addition, creatures that fail a save against any fire effect Zelishkar creates are sickened for 1 minute. Those damaged by his melee attacks or by fire effects that allow no save are instead sickened for 1 round per attack. This duration stacks.  Corpse Cremation (Su) Whenever Zelishkar reduces a living creature to negative hit points, as a swift action he can turn its body to ashes and feed upon the target's life force, as death knell (Will DC 28 negates). Whenever Zelishkar slays a creature with any attack or ability, the creature's corpse is reduced to ashes (treat as disintegrate).  Daemonic Harbinger Traits A daemonic harbinger is a powerful daemon that has not yet made the full transition from unique daemon to a horseman. It possesses several traits, as summarized here.  • Immunity to acid, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, disease, and poison.  • Resistance to cold 30, electricity 30, and fire 30.  • Telepathy 300 feet.  • The harbinger's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as evil and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  • The harbinger can grant spells to its worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on its behalf. Zelishkar grants access to the domains of Evil, Law, Magic, and Trickery. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff.  Incandescent Body (Su) As a free action, Zelishkar can cause his body to erupt into white-hot flame. He sheds light as bright as a daylight spell, and dazzles any creature that does not avert its gaze. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this dazzling effect. Zelishkar can dim his flames to burning black shadows as a free action, suppressing the dazzling effect and allowing him to use Stealth without penalty.  Incendiary Grasp (Su) If Zelishkar hits a target with more than one natural weapon in the same round, the fire damage from each hit is combined as if from a single attack for the purpose of overcoming effects that provide resistance to fire. In addition, if Zelishkar succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver, as a swift action he can suppress any fire resistance or immunity the target possesses until the beginning of Zelishkar's next turn. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this effect, unless that subtype is granted by a temporary magical effect or magic item.

Whenever a creature targets a devastator with a spell with the good descriptor, the caster must make a successful DC 30 caster level check or the spell is absorbed by the devastator and has no effect. If the devastator is in the area of effect of such a spell and the caster level check fails, the devastator absorbs the entire spell and leaves all other targets unaffected. A devastator gains 5 temporary hit points for every spell level of the spell absorbed. These temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour.  Aura of Corruption (Su) A devastator emanates an aura that bolsters chaotic evil outsiders. Any such creature with 15 or more Hit Dice within 60 feet of a devastator gains a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma. In addition, the creature's spell resistance increases by 5. If such a creature doesn't already possess spell resistance, it gains spell resistance equal to 11 + its CR.  Blasphemous Weapons (Ex) Each of a devastator's wicked weapons and its razor-sharp wings are treated as +5 unholy weapons that deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and count as chaotic and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6.  Incinerate (Su) A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures in its fiery breath. A creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by its breath weapon must make a Fortitude save (using the breath weapon's DC). Failure indicates that the creature is reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only be restored to life through true resurrection or similar magic.  Manipulate Flames (Su) An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires.  Melt Stone (Su) An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.  Smoke Vision (Ex) A very young red dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics).

Ghost Bane (Su)A young or older umbral dragon's physical attacks deal damage to incorporeal creatures normally.

Eye Rays (Su) Volnagur fires eye rays at a range of up to 120 feet. Creatures struck by his eye rays are nauseated for 1 minute (Fortitude DC 29 negates). In addition, if the target fails a second Fortitude save against the same DC, it gains one of the following conditions, lasting as long as the nauseated condition, as its mind and body begin to unravel (roll 1d6): 1-confused, 2-fatigued (exhausted if already fatigued), 3-shaken (increase severity of fear effect if already present), 4-sickened, 5-staggered, 6-stunned.

Any kuru linked to in this way must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be forced to carry out the Blood Queen's telepathic commands to the best of its ability. In addition, a linked kuru gains a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and is immune to mind-affecting effects. The blood link lasts for 1 minute or until the Blood Queen ends the effect (a free action). When the blood link is broken, the affected kuru takes 1 point of Intelligence damage and cannot be linked to again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Horrifying Bellow (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, the Blood Queen can release a terrifying bellow that affects a 30-foot-radius spread. Any creature within the affected area must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Surrogate Senses (Su) In addition to its blindsight, the Blood Queen can constantly see and hear through its unholy kuru surrogates as though with a permanent clairaudience/ clairvoyance spell. If at any time one of the Blood Queen's surrogates is killed, it is dazed for 1 round.  Unholy Gestation (Ex) Whenever the Blood Queen swallows an unconscious humanoid or renders a humanoid unconscious with its swallow whole ability, it moves the victim through its digestive track, where the victim no longer takes damage, but rather begins to gestate within the Blood Queen's transformative stomach for 1d4 rounds. After the creature has finished gestating, it is regurgitated from the hindquarters of the Blood Queen, encased in an opaque mucous pod. Any attempt to remove a gestated humanoid from its pod causes massive system shock, and the humanoid takes 6d6 points of damage unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save or those releasing it succeed at a DC 25 Heal check. As a swift action, the Blood Queen can send strong telepathic emanations to any pod within 100 feet, causing it to violently explode. The resulting spray of bilious ooze deals 6d6 points of acid damage to the creature encased in the pod and to any creatures in a 15-foot-radius burst.  Alternatively, the Blood Queen may allow an encased humanoid to continue to gestate for at least 24 hours, and after that duration may release the fully metamorphosed creature from its pod at any point. When released, the victim completes its transformation into a kuru surrogate (see the Kuru Surrogate section below). The Blood Queen may create any number of pods, but can only possess up to six kuru surrogates at any one time (if the Blood Queen releases a seventh kuru surrogate from its mucus pod, the oldest surrogate immediately dies no matter where it is and the Blood Queen is dazed for 1 round). The save DCs are Constitution-based.

A Styx elemental uses the standard 16 HD water elemental statistics with the following additional special attack:An opponent hit by a Styx elemental's slam attack must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or forget everything about its past life (treat this as a feeblemind spell). The save DC is Constitution-based. Even if the save is successful, the opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell (CL 20th) for one day. The confusion effects can be removed using break enchantment, dispel magic, or greater magic. Charon can have only one Styx elemental in existence at one time. A Styx elemental is CR 8. Immortality (Ex) Charon is native to five Lower Planes (Abyss, Gehenna, Hades, Nine Hells, and Tarterus), thus when his form is destroyed on one plane, he ceases to exist there, but still exists on the other four. When destroyed on one of the aforementioned planes, it takes but a single day for him to reform and return to that plane. To be permanently destroyed, Charon must be slain on all five Lower Planes within a single day.

A successful DC 30 Fortitude save negates the fatigue. Creatures already fatigued become exhausted; creatures already exhausted become staggered. A creature that fails its save must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or gain an overwhelming compulsion to eat flesh of creatures of its type, including its own if no other is available. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Spines (Ex) Creatures striking Chemnosit with natural weapons, unarmed strikes, melee weapons, or melee touch attacks take 2d6+12 points of damage.

Detect Gems (Sp) A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones. Divine Aid (Sp)Once a week, a great wyrm gold dragon can call upon celestial powers for aid. This functions as a miracle. Fast Flight (Ex)A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed. Fire Aura (Su)An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an aura of fire. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient gold dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action. Luck (Sp)Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Weakening Breath (Su)Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).

The titan doesn't have to breathe, eat, or drink during this time. He is aware of his immediate surroundings out to the range of his telepathy during this time, and may communicate with creatures within the range of his telepathy. Ifestus can end his stasis at any time as a free action. Entering status is a standard action.

Elementals receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day. Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control, obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals.  Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma check to gain control of the elemental.  Searing Heat (Ex) Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of Inder must succeed on a DC 37 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of fire damage. Anyone striking Inder with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 4d6 points of fire damage (DC 37 Reflex save for half). A creature that grapples Inder or is grappled by Inder takes 4d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists (DC 37 Reflex save for half). The save DCs are Constitution-based.																												
Jabberwock	23.00	819200	Huge	5	40, touch 14, flat-footed 34	455	26	20	24		31	fear of vorpal weapons, vulnerable to cold	40 ft., fly 80 ft.

This blast of strange noises and shouted nonsense in the various languages known to the jabberwock (and invariably some languages it doesn't know) affects all creatures within a 60-foot-radius spread-these creatures must make a DC 31 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. Alternatively, the jabberwock can focus its burble attack to create a 60- foot line of sonic energy that deals 20d6 points of sonic damage (DC 31 Reflex save for half ). The confusion effect is mind-affecting; both are sonic effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Damage Reduction (Ex) A jabberwock's damage reduction can be bypassed only by weapons that possess the vorpal weapon enhancement.  Eye Rays (Su) The jabberwock can project beams of fire from its eyes as a ranged touch attack as a standard action, with a range increment of 60 feet. It projects two beams, and can target different creatures with these beams if it wishes as long as both targets are within 30 feet of each other. A creature that takes damage from an eye beam suffers burn.  Fear of Vorpal Weapons (Ex) A jabberwock knows that a vorpal weapon can kill it swiftly. As soon as it takes damage from a vorpal weapon, a jabberwock becomes shaken for 1 round. If it is hit by a critical threat from a vorpal weapon, whether or not the critical hit is confirmed, the jabberwock is staggered for 1 round.  Planar Acclimation (Ex) A jabberwock is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.  Whiffling (Ex) A jabberwock's wings and violent motions create a significant amount of wind whenever it makes a full attack action. These winds surround the monster to a radius of 30 feet, and are treated as severe winds-ranged attacks take a -4 penalty when targeting a jabberwock while it is whiffling, and Medium creatures must make a DC 10 Strength check to approach the creature. Small or smaller creatures in this area that fail a DC 15 Strength check are blown away. See page 439 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for further details on the effects of severe winds.

Each time a creature takes damage from Jubilex's acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of acid damage. A DC 38 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes Jubilex also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 38 Reflex save. Jubilex's acidic touch deals 38 points of damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but he must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

When used by Kostchtchie, on a successful hit the target must make a DC 39 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. Kostchtchie does not suffer any penalty while wielding the oversized weapon. The save DC is Strength-based.

Elementals receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day. Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control, obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals.  Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma check to gain control of the elemental.  Drench (Ex) Lypso's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller. He can dispel magical fire he touches as dispel magic (CL 20th).  Vortex (Su) Lypso can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack, but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water.  Water Mastery (Ex) Lypso gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both he and his opponent are touching water. If the opponent or Lypso is touching the ground, Lypso takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether Lypso is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.

Elementals receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day. Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control, obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals.  Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma check to gain control of the elemental.

Channel Positive Energy (Su) Talmandor can expend two uses of his lay on hands ability to channel energy as a 20th-level cleric.  Coruscating Charge (Su) When Talmandor charges, he can transform his body into golden light. He becomes incorporeal until he arrives at the end of his charge and makes his physical attacks. In this form, he radiates light as a daylight spell. Any evil creature whose space he passes through is affected as by sunbeam (Reflex DC 35 negates and Reflex half), while good-aligned creatures whose space he passes through gain the benefit of good hope for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of Talmandor. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (and a caster level of 20th). The defensive benefits from the magic circle are not included in the statistics above.  Quell the Profane (Su) Talmandor's frightful presence aura affects only evil creatures. Evil creatures inside Talmandor's protective aura also become sickened, and profane bonuses are suppressed within his aura unless their caster level exceeds 20th.  Sacred Slasher (Ex) When attacking with his claws, Talmandor adds 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus on damage rolls. He also threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 and multiplies critical hit damage by 3. His claws overcome all damage reduction of evil creatures.  Twin Talons (Ex) When using the attack action, Talmandor can attack a single target with both claws.

Fafnheir	24.00	1228800	Colossal	14	42, touch 12, flat-footed 32	526	28	25	23	freedom of movement	35		50 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 100 ft.

A DC 36 Reflex save halves the fire damage dealt. The save DC is Constitution-based. This wind has two additional effects as well.  Deafening: Any creature in the area of effect that does not succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save is deafened by the thunderous wind.  Storm-Laced: The closest creature to Fafnheir in the area of effect is also blasted by a bolt of lightning and takes 20d6 points of electricity damage in addition to the fire damage dealt. This creature can make a second DC 36 Reflex save to halve this electricity damage.  Tornado Force: The winds themselves gust at nearly 300 miles per hour, affecting all creatures in the area of effect as if they were caught in tornado-force winds. The wind lasts only a few moments during Fafnheir's action, so it has no real effect on ranged attacks, but it blows away any Large or smaller creature (or Huge or smaller flying creature) that fails a DC 15 Strength check.  Death Curse (Su) Fafnheir is a difficult creature to slay, especially since he lives on in the body of any creature that slays him. When a creature slays Fafnheir, it becomes afflicted by the Curse of Fafnheir.  Curse of Fafnheir: save Will DC 32; effect creature's sense of self erodes as its personality is slowly replaced by Fafnheir's-this manifests as 1d6 points of Charisma drain every 24 hours. A target whose Charisma drops to 0 becomes comatose and must immediately make a DC 32 Fortitude save or die; every 24 hours that passes thereafter, the victim must make a new Fortitude save to avoid death (unless its Charisma score rises above 0, at which point it takes 1d6 points of Charisma drain). If a creature dies from the effects of this curse, its body explodes in a 60-foot burst of burning wind, with effects identical to Fafnheir's breath weapon. This effect occurs if the cursed victim dies from any effect, not just from the curse. One round later, Fafnheir gains the effect of a true resurrection spell, appearing at the same spot where the cursed victim died (or the closest area large enough to contain the Colossal creature), with full memories of the cursed victim's doings and accomplishments while cursed. The only way to permanently slay Fafnheir is to avoid becoming cursed after killing him, or to remove the curse before the victim dies. The effects of this curse end prematurely and immediately if Fafnheir is restored to life by other means. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Freedom of Movement (Ex) Fafnheir is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.  Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 34; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 10d6 fire damage and 1d4 drain from each ability score; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  True Seeing (Ex) Fafnheir has true seeing, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.																												
Festering Ulunat, The Unholy First	24.00	1228800	Colossal	5	42, touch 7, flat-footed 37	525	29	24	22	regeneration	35		60 ft., climb 60 ft., fly 90 ft.

As a standard action, Ulunat can move over enemies or objects, using its whole body to crush them, dealing 20d6+30 points of damage. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents that are Huge or smaller. This attack affects as many creatures as fit in Ulunat's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless Ulunat moves off them. If Ulunat chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Strength-based.  Devour Magic (Ex) Ulunat has the ability to absorb magic directed at it and create arcane feedback that has the potential to shred a spellcaster's mind. Whenever Ulunat is targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by phantasmal killer. If Ulunat is in the area of effect of a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by insanity. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Hibernation (Ex) Ulunat can sleep for centuries and doesn't need to eat during these periods of dormancy, though it eats ravenously and almost constantly once it has been awakened. If Ulunat is forced into an inhospitable environment, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken. While in hibernation, Ulunat's damage reduction improves to 50/epic and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance as well as all divination effects.  Massive (Ex) Because of Ulunat's size, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to its movement, though forests or settlements are considered difficult terrain. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square Ulunat occupies, and vice versa. Ulunat can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Ulunat gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Ulunat with a successful DC 30 Climb check, however unlike the normal rules regarding Ulunat and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on Ulunat provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.  Regeneration (Ex) Like all Spawn of Rovagug, Ulunat is a nearly indestructible force. No form of attack can suppress Ulunat's regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If Ulunat fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region from devastation, but a method to kill Spawn of Rovagug like Ulunat has yet to be discovered.  Terrible Claws (Ex) Ulunat's natural weapons ignore all forms of damage reduction and hardness.  Tremor Step (Ex) Ulunat's thunderous steps shake the ground as it moves. While moving along the ground, any creatures within 100 feet of Ulunat that are also in contact with the ground must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be knocked prone as the beast thunders along.

(20 ft. with bite)	agonizing venom, breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 2d4 Con damage from poison, Fortitude DC 33 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), constrict (2d8+21), fast swallow, lingering poisonous cloud, mythic power (10/day, surge +1d12), poison, swallow whole (6d6 bludgeoning damage plus poison, AC 25, 52 hp)	Str 38, Dex 13, Con 30, Int 15, Wis 24, Cha 25	26	+44 (+48 grapple)	51 (55 vs. grapple, can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Agonizing Venom (Ex) Any creature failing its saving throw against the dragon's breath weapon, poison, or poisonous blood is sickened with pain for 1 minute. A second, third, and fourth failed saving throw mean the creature is also staggered for 1 minute, nauseated for 1 minute, and helpless for 1 minute, respectively. This is a pain effect. If the dragon expends one use of mythic power when poisoning a creature, the dragon's breath weapon and poison overcome any poison immunity the target has.  Aura of Security (Su) A guardian dragon is alerted whenever a Tiny or larger creature enters its aura (as a mental alarm spell). If its dimensional lock spell-like ability is dispelled or destroyed, it may expend two uses of mythic power to cast it again. The dragon can use its false vision spell-like ability only within its aura, and the duration ends if the aura's area no longer includes the affected area.  Heroic Challenge (Su) Once per day, a guardian dragon can give a non-mythic creature the agile, arcane, divine, invincible, or savage mythic template (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 224). The dragon must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the amount the target creature's CR increases. The creature isn't under the dragon's control, but won't willingly attack the dragon unless magically forced to do so. Alternatively, the dragon can expend one use of mythic power to create difficult terrain in a 100-foot-radius burst; the type of difficult terrain is appropriate to the area (mud in plains, rubble in mountains, and so on). The effects of this ability persist as long as the dragon remains within 10 miles of the affected creature or area.  Lingering Poisonous Cloud (Su) The guardian dragon can expend one use of mythic power when it uses its breath weapon to have the cloud remain for 10 rounds, functioning as cloudkill. The dragon can expend one additional use of mythic power for this to function as mythic cloudkill.  Poison (Ex) Bite or swallow whole-injury; save Fort DC 33; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str and 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Secret Lair (Su) A guardian dragon can spend 1 hour concentrating to create a labyrinthine extradimensional lair for itself and whatever it is guarding. This functions like greater create demiplane (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 213) and creates a demiplane with the morphic, portal, shape, and structure properties. The demiplane is approximately a 500-foot-diameter sphere, and the dragon usually fills it with a maze of corridors (most of which are large enough for the Gargantuan dragon to move through) to confuse and delay invaders intent on stealing its treasure. The demiplane's portal is connected to a spot in the dragon's hidden lair, and over time the dragon usually brings guardian creatures from the Material Plane to add to the demiplane's defenses. The dragon can have only one demiplane active at a time, and the demiplane dissolves 10d10 minutes after the dragon leaves, so the dragon leaves only for a few minutes at a time or if its treasure has been stolen.  Vengeful Seeker (Ex) A guardian dragon gains the swift tracker and quarry abilities of a ranger when tracking or hunting any creature that has confirmed a critical hit against it, penetrated its spell resistance, or taken any amount of its treasure. Any divination spell-like ability a guardian dragon uses to locate such a creature or its treasure counts as the mythic version of the spell, if appropriate.																												
Hekatonkheires	24.00	1228800	Colossal	6	42, touch 4, flat-footed 40	516	30	12	18	spell turning	35		60 ft.	#ERROR!	rock +22/+17/+12/+7 (8d8+31/18-20)	30 ft.	30 ft.	rock throwing (200 ft.), stunning slam	Str 48, Dex 15, Con 43, Int 22, Wis 19, Cha 24	24	+51 (+53 bull rush)	63 (65 vs. bull rush)	PFRPG Bestiary 3	Hands of War (Su) Any weapon a hekatonkheires wields gains a +3 enhancement bonus while the titan holds it. A hekatonkheires's attacks are treated as epic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, a hekatonkheires's multitude of arms allows it to effectively block attacks, granting it a +8 armor bonus to its AC.  Hundred-Handed Whirlwind (Ex) A hekatonkheires carries several dozen weapons of various types in its hundred hands, but when it attacks in melee, you don't have to resolve each of these as a separate attack. Instead, when the titan attacks with its weapons, it rolls its attacks normally (either one attack for a standard action, or four as a full-round action) and hits every creature in its reach each time an attack roll exceeds that creature's AC. If any such attack roll results in a possible critical hit, the critical is applied to one creature of the hekatonkheires's choosing. The hekatonkheires can choose to deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage as a free action on each separate hit.  Planar Leap (Su) A hekatonkheires traverses the planes by physically smashing through planar boundaries and crashing devastatingly into the target plane itself. Once per year as a full-round action, a hekatonkheires can, as part of a jump, plane shift to any other plane (as per the spell of the same name). It can only bring itself and its gear when it travels in this manner. When the hekatonkheires reaches its destination plane, it falls from the sky and crashes to the ground, creating a devastating explosion of thunder and fire. Any creature within 300 feet of the point where the hekatonkheires lands (including the titan itself ) takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 20d6 points of sonic damage (Reflex DC 38 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stunning Slam (Ex) As a standard action, a hekatonkheires may forgo any weapon attacks to make a single slam attack against any creature in reach. If it hits, the target takes damage and must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.																												
Nightripper	24.00	1228800	Medium	11	42, touch 25, flat-footed 31	526	27	30	25		35		60 ft.	#ERROR!		5 ft.	5 ft. (15 ft. with talons)	curse of living death, slowing gaze, sneak attack +3d6, swift cuts, sword mastery	Str 29, Dex 32, Con 39, Int 18, Wis 23, Cha 24	27	36	61	Inner Sea Bestiary	Curse of Living Death (Su) Once per round, as a free action as he kills a living creature, Nightripper can choose to afflict that target with the curse of living death. The target can resist this curse with a successful DC 30 Will save right before it dies, allowing the victim to die normally. If the victim fails its save, it enters a sort of half-living state; it becomes completely helpless, unable to take any actions whatsoever, but remains conscious and aware of the world, and of the pain in its body. It cannot be resurrected or otherwise restored to life until the curse is lifted. While the curse remains in effect, the victim takes 1d4 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain every day as any lingering shreds of sanity are blasted away. When each ability score is drained to zero, the DC of the curse increases by +4. A character suffering the curse of living death can remain in this state forever, but as long as any one of her mental ability scores is at zero, she is capable only of enduring pain and cannot observe the world around her. Even if the character's body is destroyed, the cursed victim's consciousness remains as a disembodied and invisible presence at the site of this destruction, and cannot be resurrected or released to the afterlife. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Nascent Demon Lord Traits A nascent demon lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. They have several traits, as summarized here.  • Immunity to charm and compulsion effects, death effects, electricity, and poison.  • Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30.  • Summon (Sp) Once per day, Nightripper can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.  • Telepathy 300 feet.  • Nightripper's natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  • Nightripper can grant spells to his worshipers. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Darkness, Evil, and Strength. His favored weapon is the bastard sword.  Slowing Gaze (Su) Slowed (as the slow spell) for 1 round, 30 feet, Will DC 30 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Swift Cuts (Ex) As long as he is attacking with a sword, Nightripper treats foes who are staggered, nauseated, or under the effects of a slow spell (or similar effects, such as his gaze) as if they were flat-footed.  Sword Mastery (Ex) Nightripper possesses several sword-related bonus feats normally restricted to fighters.																												
Onyst	24.00	1230000	Huge	2	37, touch 11, flat-footed 34	660	35	24	21		35		30 ft., burrow 30 ft.	2 slams +58 (4d8+19/19-20)		15 ft.	15 ft.	command earth elementals (DC 36), earth mastery	Str 49, Dex 14, Con 32, Int 20, Wis 22, Cha 22	40	61	74	Tome of Horrors 4	Command Elementals (Su) As a standard action, an elemental lord can attempt to gain control of any elemental creature of the same element within 100 feet. Elementals receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day. Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control, obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals.  Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma check to gain control of the elemental.  Earth Glide (Ex) Onyst can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, he can even glide through lava. His burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of his presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing him flings him back 30 feet, stunning him for 1 round unless he succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.  Earth Mastery (Ex) Onyst gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both he and his foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, Onyst takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether Onyst is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)																												
Yamasoth	24.00	1228800	Gargantuan	11	43, touch 18, flat-footed 35	526	33	28	18		35		30 ft., fly 60 ft.

(30 ft. with tentacles)	constrict (2d6+13), gaze weapon, horrific appearance (DC 29), polymorph plague, rend (4 bites, 2d8+19), tentacle transformation	Str 36, Dex 25, Con 38, Int 25, Wis 21, Cha 22	27	+44 (+48 grapple)	66 (can't be tripped)	AP 64	Gaze Weapon (Su) As a free action at the start of his turn, Yamasoth can gape his central maw wide to expose the horrific red eye lodged in what should be his throat. This gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet, and polymorphs creatures affected by it into giant vermin, animals, or magical beasts (Fortitude DC 37 resists). Yamasoth chooses what creatures to transform victims into as they fail their saving throws. This effect otherwise functions as polymorph any object (CL 20th), and is a polymorph effect. Yamasoth can keep his maw open for up to 3 consecutive rounds, after which his throat-eye closes and this gaze weapon cannot be used again for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to Yamasoth's horrific appearance are stunned. At the start of each round thereafter, a creature stunned in this way can make a choice- fight the overwhelming chaos and horror and attempt a new DC 29 Will save to end the stun effect and act normally on that round, or accept the chaos into its soul and automatically succeed at the save to recover from the stun effect. This latter option immediately shifts the creature's alignment one step closer to chaotic evil. This shift in alignment can be fixed via atonement, but counts as a voluntary alignment shift for the purposes of atonement's material component requirements. A creature that becomes chaotic evil as a result of this also becomes a willing minion and ally of Yamasoth.  Maw (Ex) Yamasoth's central maw is a primary attack that threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A creature hit by Yamasoth's maw while his gaze weapon is active takes a -4 penalty on its next saving throw against the gaze attack.  Polymorph Plague (Su) Any creature that has been affected by one of Yamasoth's polymorph effects becomes "contagious." For 24 hours after the creature's initial transformation, any other creature that touches or is touched by the polymorphed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the polymorphed creature's HD + the polymorphed creature's Constitution modifier) to resist polymorphing into a creature identical to the current form of the polymorphed creature.  Qlippoth Lord Traits A qlippoth lord is a powerful and unique qlippoth that rules a significant portion of an Abyssal realm. Qlippoth lords possess the following traits.  • Immunity to cold, death effects, mind-affecting effects, and poison.  • Resistance to acid 30, electricity 30, and fire 30.  • Horrific Appearance (Su) This ability functions similarly to the typical qlippoth ability, save that qlippoth lords' horrific appearances often create physical effects and changes in their victims. Despite these physical effects, a qlippoth lord's horrific appearance remains a mind-affecting effect.  • Summon Qlippoth (Sp) Once per day, a qlippoth lord can summon any qlippoth or combination of qlippoth whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.  • Telepathy 300 feet.  • A qlippoth lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  • Qlippoth lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the qlippoth lord's behalf. All qlippoth lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil; in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to each qlippoth lord's themes and interests.  Tentacle Transformation (Su) At the start of every odd-numbered round, three of Yamasoth's tentacle tips transform into one of three different types of appendages-a serpent's head, a clawed hand, or a metallic blade. The three tentacles all change into the same type of attack, and the change persists for 1 full round, after which the three tentacles revert to normal tentacles on every even-numbered round. While transformed, the limbs make the following types of attacks instead of tentacle attacks.  • Blade: talon +36 (3d6+13/19-20)  • Clawed Hand: claw +36 (2d6+13 plus bleed damage equal to the damage dealt by the claw)  • Serpent Head: bite +36 (1d8+13 plus poison: bite- injury; save Fort DC 37; frequency 1/round for 12 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex drain and slowed for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive saves)

Grimfang: Grimfang is a Large +3 unholy vorpal battleaxe. A creature subjected to the vorpal effects of Grimfang can only be returned to life by the casting of a miracle, wish, or a true resurrection spell (the last of which must be cast on consecrated ground).

This is otherwise similar to a control undead spell cast by a 20th-level sorcerer and does not count against his 40 HD summoning limit (unless Amon summoned the creatures).  Fear Gaze (Su) A creature that successfully saves against Amon's fear gaze cannot be affected again for one day.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Craver: Amon's unique oversized weapon is a Huge +4 axiomatic thundering heavy mace. In Duke Amon's hands it deals double his Strength bonus to damage in addition to its +4 enhancement bonus when he uses it two-handed (+30 total).  He is able to use the oversized weapon without penalty.

If successful, the target takes damage equal to the lords's Strength modifier and is moved back as normal. The balor lord does not need to move with the target if successful. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Scent (Ex)The balor lord gains the scent ability while raging and can use this ability to locate unseen foes. Death Throes (Su)When killed, a balor lord explodes in a blinding flash of fire that deals 100 points of damage (half fire, half unholy damage) to anything within 100 feet. A Reflex save DC 35 halve the damage, this DC increases to 37 if the balor lord was killed in rage as the save DC is Constitution-based. Entangle (Ex) If a balor lord strikes a Medium or smaller foe with its whip, the balor can immediately attempt a grapple check without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the balor wins the check, it draws the foe into an adjacent square. The foe gains the grappled condition, but the balor does not. Flaming Body (Su)A balor lord's body is covered in dancing flames. Anyone striking a balor with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a balor or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists. Lifedrinker (Su) Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a heal spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per round. Vorpal Strike (Su)Any slashing weapon a balor lord wields (including its standard longsword and whip) gains the vorpal weapon quality. Weapons retain this quality for one hour after the balor releases the weapon, but after this the weapon reverts to its standard magical qualities, if any. Whip Mastery (Ex)A balor lord treats a whip as a light weapon for the purposes of two-weapon fighting, and can inflict lethal damage on a foe regardless of the foe's armor.

If he hits, he pulls apart any armor worn by his foe. This attack deals 2d8+23 points of damage to the opponent's armor.  Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.  Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful Craft (armorsmithing) check.  Musileim: Baphomet's unique weapon is a Huge +4 unholy halberd of speed. He is able to wield the over-sized weapon without penalty.																												
Drakainia	25.00	1638400	Huge	9	48, touch 13, flat-footed 43	642	28	15	6		36		50 ft., climb 30 ft., swim 30 ft.	2 claws +31 (4d8+14/16-20/x4), gore +28 (4d6+7), 4 tentacles +29 (2d6+7)		15 ft.	15 ft. (20 ft. with claws)	impregnate surrogate, mythic power (10/day, surge +1d12), razor claws, well of life	Str 38, Dex 20, Con 46, Int 29, Wis 21, Cha 41	18	5	17	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Birth Spawn (Ex) As a full-round action, a drakainia can give birth to a spawn, which is a Large or smaller creature of her choice with a single random mutation (see the facing page). Each day she can produce any number of creatures whose combined total base CR does not exceed 3 + her Constitution modifier (usually 21).  Gestation Aura (Su) A drakainia's aura pulses with developing life. All poisons or diseases active within her 30-foot aura have an onset of 1 round and a frequency of 1/minute. Impregnated creatures within her aura gestate in 2d4 rounds. Any creature born within her aura gains a mutation as if it were the drakainia's spawn, though if the creature's parent was not impregnated by the drakainia, the creature born is an infant of the kind its biological parents would produce, and doesn't count toward the CR limit the drakainia can spawn per day.  Impregnate Surrogate (Su) A drakainia can disgorge a monstrous embryo into the mouth of a living, corporeal creature that is pinned or helpless. She makes a grapple combat maneuver check, and if she succeeds she impregnates that creature regardless of its gender. A mythic character must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being impregnated; a non-mythic character is impregnated automatically. An impregnated creature's pregnancy lasts for 2d4 rounds. During this pregnancy, the victim is nauseated until the monster bursts forth from the victim's abdomen, which deals 10d6 points of damage to the pregnant creature and applies the broken condition to any armor it is wearing. Remove disease (DC 28) eliminates the unnatural embryo. Alternatively, as a full-round action another creature can attempt to cut out the growing monster with a DC 38 Heal check. On a successful check, the offspring is removed, and the formerly pregnant creature takes 1d4 points of bleed damage. On failed check, the pregnant creature takes 2d6 points of bleed damage and is stunned for 1 round, but the offspring is not removed. The creature spawned by means of this impregnation is any creature of the drakainia's choice that is at least one size category smaller than the creature she impregnated. These spawn count against the drakainia's daily CR allowance for birth spawn (see above).  Invert Birth (Su) When a drakainia uses her dimension door spell-like ability, instead of the normal range, she can choose to teleport to any space occupied by one of her spawn that is within 1 mile of her. She doesn't need line of sight or knowledge of the spawn's location. If she chooses a spawn that is farther than a mile away, she does not lose the use of the spell-like ability, but does lose the action. On arrival, she explodes out from her offspring, destroying it entirely.  Polymorphism (Ex) The spawn gestating inside the drakainia constantly alter her internal construction, making her immune to bleed, disease, poison, and polymorph effects. When she is subject to a critical hit or a sneak attack, this polymorphism grants her a 75% chance of negating such attacks.  Razor Claws (Ex) A drakainia's claws are razor sharp with a critical threat range of 17-20 and a critical multiplier of x4.  Transfer Suffering (Su) As a swift action, a drakainia can transfer a single harmful spell effect or condition from herself to one of her offspring that is currently within her gestation aura.  Well of Life (Su) A drakainia can unleash the primal life energy within in her body to channel positive energy as if she were a 20th-level cleric (DC 35). She can use this ability 18 times per day and can choose to expend 1 use of mythic power at each use to maximize the damage healed.

Intelligence drain, scholastic masquerade, spell reservoir	Str 22, Dex 33, Con 35, Int 30, Wis 26, Cha 37	32	38	65	Inner Sea Bestiary	Infernal Duke Traits An infernal duke is a powerful devil that has not yet made the full transition from unique devil to full archdevil. It possesses several traits, as summarized here.  • Immunity to charm and compulsion effects, death effects, fire, and poison.  • Resistance to acid 30 and cold 30.  • Telepathy 300 feet.  • Lorthact's natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields, are treated as evil and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  • Lorthact can grant spells to his worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on his behalf. Lorthact grants access to the domains of Evil, Law, Magic, and Trickery. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff.  Intelligence Drain (Su) Lorthact drains 1 point of Intelligence each time he hits with a weapon or natural weapon (Will DC 39 negates). Alternatively, he can make a single melee touch attack per round, dealing no hit point damage but draining 2d4 points of Intelligence (Will DC 39 half). After draining Intelligence from a creature, Lorthact gains the benefit of foresight (as the spell) against that creature for 1 minute.  Scholastic Masquerade (Su) When targeting a dominated wizard with his spell reservoir ability, Lorthact can also steal a school power from that wizard's chosen school. He can steal one of the wizard's 1st-level school powers by using three levels of his spell reservoir, both 1st-level school powers at a cost of six levels, and all school powers at a cost of nine levels. While Lorthact retains these powers, the target wizard cannot use them. The stolen powers function at the target wizard's level. Lorthact can steal school powers or a prepared spell from a dominated wizard, but not both. He may steal school powers from multiple schools if he has multiple wizards dominated.  Spell Reservoir (Su) Lorthact can drain prepared arcane spells from the mind of a creature he has dominated and store them for later use, similarly to a ring of spell storing. Draining a spell requires 1 full-round action if he is able to touch the target, or 1 minute to perform through the mental link provided by the dominate effect; in either case, no saving throw is allowed. He can hold no more than one stolen spell from each dominated caster in his spell reservoir, and the total level of stolen spells cannot exceed 25. These stolen spells take effect at the original caster's level.  Temporal Anomaly (Su) Lorthact exists slightly outside of the normal timestream. Spells that predict the future-such as augury, divination, foresight, and moment of prescience- cannot perceive him and provide no benefit against him or information about him. In addition, whenever a creature within 60 feet of him uses time stop, Lorthact can act normally within the duration of the time stop, as if he had cast it himself. As neither Lorthact nor the caster are frozen in time with respect to each other, each can target and affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create, though they cannot affect other creatures within the duration of the time stop. This ability functions even if Lorthact is flat-footed or unaware of his opponent.																												
Mythic Wyrm Red Dragon	25.00	1638400	Gargantuan	#ERROR!	50, touch 4, flat-footed 50	518	24	13	22	dragon blood (2d6 fire), fortification (50%)	36	vulnerable to cold	40 ft., fly 250 ft.

All creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn.  Manipulate Flames (Su) A wyrm red dragon can control any fire spell within 110 feet of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires.  Melt Stone (Su) The dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 55-foot-radius area. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.																												
Shamira	25.00	1638400	Medium	11	42, touch 35, flat-footed 31	553	28	30	26	fire shield, freedom of movement	36	vulnerable to cold	40 ft., fly 80 ft. (perfect)	2 claws +36 (1d8+9 plus 4d6 fire and burn), tail slap +31 (2d6+4 plus 4d6 fire, burn, and grab), 2 wings +31 (1d8+4 plus 4d6 fire and burn)	firebow +43/+38/+33/+28 (1d8+14/19-20/x3 plus 1d6 fire and burn)	5 ft.	5 ft.	burn (8d6 fire, DC 38), constrict (2d6+13 plus 4d6 fire and burn), dream haunting, energy drain, fiery passion, profane benediction	Str 29, Dex 32, Con 40, Int 28, Wis 25, Cha 37	27	+36 (+40 grapple)	71	AP 76	Divine Deception (Su) Once per day while Shamira uses her change shape ability, she can choose to emulate a different alignment for the purpose of divination spells that reveal auras (such as detect evil). This effect persists as long as she carries a holy symbol of a deity of the same alignment she wishes to emulate. This holy symbol must have been given to her within the previous hour by a worshiper of that deity; Shamira typically secures these symbols via mind control. This effect last for 2d6 hours, after which point the holy symbol crumbles to ashes. While it lasts, spells and other magical effects treat her alignment as if it were the feigned alignment, not her true alignment of chaotic evil. If she uses a symbol of Sarenrae to appear neutral good, this effect lasts for 24 hours before the symbol crumbles to dust.  Dream Haunting (Su) Shamira can use her energy drain attack, mind-affecting spell-like abilities, and profane benediction abilities on any creature she successfully affects with her nightmare spell-like ability while that ability is in effect. Once she uses one of these abilities against her target, the nightmare spell ends-she can only use one of these abilities per use of nightmare.  Energy Drain (Su) Shamira's energy drain ability functions like that of a succubus, except that it drains 2 levels per use. As a free action as part of this attack, she may choose use her burn special attack with her energy drain. With a successful DC 36 Will save, a character resists the suggestion implanted by this attack, and a successful DC 36 Fortitude save negates the negative level after 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based.  Fiery Passion (Su) Shamira's passions and fires are one. A creature must be immune to both fire and mind-affecting effects in order to be immune to fire damage caused by Shamira. Creatures immune only to fire instead take fire damage as if they instead had fire resistance 10. Creatures with fire resistance and no immunity to mind-affecting effects take fire damage from Shamira's attacks as if they had no fire resistance.  Firebow (Su) As a swift action, Shamira can conjure a +5 flaming burst unholy composite longbow that creates arrows as she fires it. In addition, arrows fired from her firebow can inflict her burn special attack.  Nascent Demon Lord Traits In addition to many of the defenses and abilities incorporated into Shamira's statistics above, her weapons (natural and manufactured) are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction. Also, she can grant spells to her worshipers-she grants access to the domains of Chaos, Charm, Evil, and Nobility and the subdomains of Demon, Leadership, Love, and Lust.  Profane Benediction (Su) This ability functions as the succubus's profane gift ability, except it grants a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of the target's choice rather than a +2 bonus. If the target is a worshiper of Sarenrae, the target also gains immunity to fire as long as the profane benediction persists, even if the worshiper at some point later abandons her faith in Sarenrae (as is often the case with those who are eager to keep their profane benedictions).  Summon Demons (Sp) As a nascent demon lord, Shamira can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.																												
Shipbreaker Sea Serpent	25.00	1640000	Colossal	5	31, touch 4, flat-footed 29	665	33	24	26				10 ft., swim 40 ft.	bite +43 (5d6+16/19-20 plus poison and grab)		50 ft.	50 ft.	capsize, constrict (5d6+16), poison	Str 32, Dex 13, Con 30, Int 11, Wis 17, Cha 21	38	+57 (+61 grapple)	69 (can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Capsize (Ex) A shipbreaker sea serpent can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the sea serpent's size, the sea serpent takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.  Poison (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort DC 41; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 2d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

There is a 30% chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster; otherwise it is simply negated.  Powerful Leaper (Ex) The tarrasque uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics checks made to jump, and has a +24 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump.  Regeneration (Ex) No form of attack can suppress the tarrasque's regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If the tarrasque fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is inflicted upon its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but the method to truly kill it has yet to be discovered.  Rush (Ex) Once per minute for 1 round, the tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet. This increases its Acrobatics bonus on checks made to jump to +87.  Spines (Ex) The tarrasque can loose a volley of six spear-like spines from its body as a standard action with a toss of its head or a lash of its tail. Make an attack roll for each spine-all targets must be within 30 feet of each other.  The spines have a range increment of 120 ft.

There is a 30% chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster; otherwise it is simply negated.  Powerful Leaper (Ex) The tarrasque uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics checks made to jump, and has a +24 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump.  Rush (Ex) Once per minute, for 1 round, the tarrasque's speed increases to 150 feet, and its Acrobatics bonus on checks made to jump increases to +87.  Spines (Ex) The tarrasque can loose a volley of six spear-like spines from its body as a standard action with a toss of its head or a lash of its tail. Make an attack roll for each spine- all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The spines have a range increment of 120 ft.																												
Treerazer	25.00	1638400	Huge	14	42, touch 22, flat-footed 32	574	34	23	10	freedom of movement	36		60 ft., fly 60 ft. (good), swim 40 ft.	Blackaxe +44/+39/+34/+29 (4d6+24/19-20/x3 plus 1d6  acid), bite +37 (2d6+6), 2 wings +37 (1d8+6)		20 ft.	20 ft.	defoliation	Str 36, Dex 30, Con 40, Int 21, Wis 24, Cha 25	28	15	31 (can't be tripped)	Inner Sea World Guide	Aura of Corruption (Su) Treerazer exudes an aura of corruption to a radius of 120 feet. This aura causes plants to grow hideous, sprouting thorns, twisting, and becoming fungoid in nature.  Creatures with woodland stride or freedom of movement can move through this fungal bloom with ease. Living creatures within Treerazer's aura of corruption must make a DC 39 Fortitude save each round or their flesh grows pasty and clammy as tendrils of diseased plant matter and fungal growth sprout from it. This condition persists as long as the creature remains within Treerazer's aura of corruption and for 1 minute thereafter. While suffering the effects of this aura, the living creature is treated as a plant for the purposes of spells and effects that harm or otherwise inconvenience plant creatures more than other creatures. The victim would thus be subject to antiplant shell, blight, and additional damage from horrid wilting or a plant bane weapon, and could be affected by control plants. The corruption does not otherwise impart plant traits to creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Defoliation (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Treerazer can exude a pulse of defoliating energy in a 30-foot-radius spread. This pulse appears as a wave of sickly green energy, and causes all plants and plant creatures in the area to blacken and wither. Such creatures take 20d10 points of damage and 1d8 points of Strength drain, or half with a successful DC 39 Fortitude save. A plant that isn't a creature (such as a tree or a shrub) doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies. Treerazer can choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this effect, and generally does so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants and fungus. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Nascent Demon Lord Traits A nascent demon lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. Treerazer's current exile to the Material Plane prevents him from achieving full demon lord status. Yet he still possesses the typical nascent demon lord traits, which are similar to those possessed by a typical demon, only more potent, as summarized here.  • Immunity to death effects, electricity, charm and compulsion effects, and poison.  • Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30.  • Summon (Sp) Once per day, nascent demon lords can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.  • Telepathy 300 ft.  • A nascent demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction.  • Nascent demon lords can grant spells to their worshipers.  Granting spells does not require any specific action on the nascent demon lord's behalf. All nascent demon lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil-in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to the nascent demon lord's themes and interests.																												
Bezravnis	26.00	2457600	Colossal	9	44, touch 7, flat-footed 39	615	32	24	20	ferocity, recovery			100 ft., burrow 100 ft.	2 claws +40 (4d6+18/19-20 plus grab), 3 stings +40 (3d6+18/19-20 plus 2d6 fire and poison)		50 ft.	50 ft.	burrowing charge, constrict (4d6+27), heat beam, hurl foe, poison, trample (2d8+27, DC 43), web (+27 ranged, DC 40, 30 hp)	Str 47, Dex 20, Con 40, Int 3, Wis 26, Cha 23	30	+56 (+60 bull rush, +60 grapple)	71 (73 vs. bull rush, 83 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Burrowing Charge (Ex) Once per minute, Bezravnis can make a charge attack while burrowing through loose earth, sand, mud, or magma, or through any other loosely packed earth or stone. When Bezaravnis reaches the target, it erupts from the ground as part of its attack. If Bezravnis hits the target of its burrowing charge attack, it deals double damage with its attack. Any creatures standing in or flying less than 50 feet above the space Bezravnis occupies at the end of this charge are immediately subjected to Bezravnis's trample attack. Any buildings entirely within this space take double damage from the trample attack (4d8+54 points)-this damage bypasses hardness. In addition, Huge or smaller creatures must succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save or be buried in earth, as if by a cave-in or collapse. This bury zone extends into all squares affected by Bezravnis's reach.  Heat Beam (Su) Once every 4 rounds, Bezravnis can fire beams of searing heat and fire from one of its three stingers. Each stinger's heat beam is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju may fire one heat beam from a stinger as a move action, two heat beams as a standard action, or all three as a full-round action. Each heat beam is a 1,200-foot-long line that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to everything in its path (Reflex DC 40 half). If Bezravnis fires more than one heat beam, it can direct them in different directions. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison (Su) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect staggered for 1 round plus loss of fire immunity and resistance; cure 3 consecutive saves. As long as a creature suffers the effects of Bezravnis's poison, it loses all racial resistances and immunities to fire. Any spell or spell-like effects active when the target fails its initial saving throw against this poison are suppressed as long as it continues to be staggered by the poison. New effects of this nature that become active after that initial failed saving throw function normally if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 caster level check; otherwise, the spell effects are suppressed until the victim is no longer staggered.  Web (Ex) Bezravnis's webs are immune to fire damage. In addition, these webs are semi-living things that continue to crush and squeeze those entangled by them. If a creature is entangled in the webs, at the start of each turn during which it is entangled, it takes 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage as the webs crush and constrict it. This ability otherwise functions the same as the universal monster ability.																												
Korada	26.00	2457600	Large	22	45, touch 40, flat-footed 36	528	21	30	30	never surprised	37		90 ft., climb 30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Like a monk, he adds his Wisdom bonus to his AC and CMD. As a swift action, Korada may enter the basic stance of any combat style feat (such as Crane StyleUC, Monkey StyleUC, and so on) as if he had the first feat in the feat path for that combat style. By expending 2 points of ki, he may use any two feats from his current combat style's feat path for the next minute; if he changes his stance, the previous stance's feats become unavailable but he may use feats from the new stance.  Primal Aura (Su) Korada's primal aura radiates calm and tranquility, automatically suppressing any non-mythic charm or compulsion effect on any creature within its area. Any creature in his aura (including him) can deal nonlethal damage with weapons without taking the -4 penalty on attack rolls for doing so.  Shatter Spells (Su) Korada can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a wall of fire) by attacking it with an unarmed strike. He must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend 2 points of ki. If the attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted greater dispel magic (CL 20th). If he dispels an effect, he suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.  Tranquil Master (Su) Korada may attack without breaking his sanctuary spell-like ability so long as he only attempts to deal nonlethal damage.																												
Kostchtchie	26.00	2457600	Huge	6	44, touch 30, flat-footed 38	604	35	20	31	Abyssal resurrection, freedom of movement, rock catching	37	vulnerable to fire	60 ft., climb 60 ft.	#ERROR!	rock +37/+32/+27/+22 (2d6+19)	15 ft.	15 ft.	clutch foe, crushing blow, favored enemy (giants +4, humans +4, see below), powerful slam, rock throwing (600 ft.), vengeful strike	Str 48, Dex 23, Con 38, Int 25, Wis 30, Cha 27	31	+52 (+54 bull rush, +56 grapple, +56 sunder)	86 (88 vs. bull rush, 88 vs. sunder)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Clutch Foe (Ex) If Kostchtchie chooses to use his hand to make a grapple check when he successfully slams and grabs a Medium or smaller opponent, he takes a -20 penalty on the grapple check. On following rounds, he can attempt to maintain his grapple on the creature as a swift action. If successful, he can constrict the creature for 1d8+28 points of damage, throw the creature (treat this as a bull rush), or use the creature as an improvised weapon. An opponent used as a weapon takes half as much damage as it deals to the creature it hits.  Crushing Blow (Su) Once per round, Kostchtchie may designate any attack with his warhammer to be a crushing blow. He must designate this attack before making the attack roll. If he hits, the blow ignores the target's hardness and damage reduction, and allows him to make a free trip attempt against the target. This trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity, can target a foe of any size, and has no chance of causing Kostchtchie to fall prone if he fails. A creature struck by a crushing blow must attempt a DC 44 Fortitude save; success means the creature is staggered for 1 round, and failure means it is stunned for 1 round and staggered for 1d6 rounds afterward. The save DC is Strength-based. Favored Enemy (Su) Against female giants or female humans, Kostchtchie's favored enemy bonuses increase to +8. Once per day, he can declare any one creature as a favored enemy, but only if that creature has damaged, humiliated, or otherwise inconvenienced him at some point in the previous 24 hours. His favored enemy bonuses against that creature last 24 hours.  Powerful Slam (Ex) Kostchtchie's slam attack is considered a primary attack even when he uses a weapon in his other hand, and he always adds his full Strength bonus to damage dealt with his slam attack.  Vengeful Strike (Su) Once per round, Kostchtchie may make an attack of opportunity against any creature that strikes him in melee combat. This attack of opportunity has a critical threat range of 18-20. Against female targets, the vengeful strike is also a crushing blow.

It does lethal damage as a heavy flail and does threaten the squares in its range but has the reach of a whip. In addition if used to make trip or disarm attacks, then the wielder can make six trip or disarm attempts in a round as a full-round action and receive the benefits of having both the Improved Trip and Improved Disarm feats, even if he does not have the necessary prerequisites.																												
Xaphan	26.00	2460000	Large	12	46, touch 27, flat-footed 38	717	26	29	30		37		40 ft., fly 60 ft.

Creatures within 5 feet of or grappling Xaphan take 1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of unholy damage each round. There is no save against either effect, but resistance to or immunity to fire reduces or negates the fire damage. Fiery Gaze (Su) A creature that meets Xaphan's gaze must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or be affected as follows: 1st-round: The victim's blood begins to boil, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage this round; the victim takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability and skill checks, and saves. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties. 2nd-round: The victim's blood reaches searing temperatures and begins to burn away muscle and flesh; the circumstance penalty increases to -4. Smoke rises from the victim's flesh. The victim takes 6d6 points of fire damage this round. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties. 3rd-round: The victim's blood erupts into an inferno and explodes from its body dealing 12d6 points of fire damage; the victim is stunned for 3 rounds. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but the victim is still stunned. A successful Will save renders a creature immune to Xaphan's gaze for one day. The save DC against the gaze is Charisma-based and the Fortitude saves are Constitution-based. Hellstorm: Xaphan's unique weapon, Hellstorm, is a Large +4 unholy flaming burst falchion.

Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded and staggered for 1d6 rounds by the blast of light. A successful saving throw reduces the blindness to 1 round and negates the staggered effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, each of Agyra's twin heads can breathe out a line of electricity to a range of 1,200 feet. Agyra can breathe each line in a different direction. Each creature caught in a line of electricity must succeed at a DC 41 Reflex save or take 20d6 points of electricity damage and be staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. A creature struck by both breath weapons simultaneously must attempt separate saving throws against each breath weapon, but takes a -4 penalty on both-the damage and staggered condition duration stack with each other. A creature wearing medium or heavy metal armor or a creature composed mostly of metal that fails its saving throw is also stunned for 1 round. A creature slain by Agyra's breath weapon remains electrified for 2d4 rounds after death-any creature that touches the body automatically takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Electrified Corpse (Su) If Agyra is slain, her corpse crackles and flashes with pulses of electrical light if she has not used her rebirth ability that year. Any creature that touches her corpse takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Even if Agyra's body is destroyed, the site of her death continues to carry this electrical charge for 1 minute, or until Agyra is reborn, whichever comes first.  Hurricane (Sp) Once per day, Agyra can create a supernatural hurricane surrounding herself. This effect functions as control weather, save that it affects an area with a 4-mile radius, lasts for 24 hours, and can only be used to create hurricane-force winds. The hurricane created is static, and features a calm eye at the center with a 500-foot radius.  Rebirth (Su) Agyra remains dead for only 1 minute before she come back to life, as if via a true resurrection spell. Agyra rises from the exact same position she occupied when she died, and typically takes advantage of this second chance to use her swift flight to escape as soon as possible. Agyra can only be reborn in this manner once per year; if she is slain a second time before a year has passed, her death is permanent and her corpse does not become electrified. This ability replaces Agyra's ability to immediately heal damage that would normally kill her, granted by her recovery ability, but does not replace the other defenses granted by recovery.  Storm Flier (Ex) Agyra does not take penalties on Fly checks when flying in strong or more powerful winds.  Swift Flight (Su) As a standard action once per hour, Agyra can fly in a straight line at an incredible speed. She may travel up to 1 mile in this manner-doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When Agyra activates this ability, her thunderous blast ability is automatically triggered from the swift flight's point of origin.  Thunderous Blast (Su) When Agyra uses her swift flight, she creates a thunderous sonic boom. This devastating explosion of sound occurs at her location when she activates swift flight, filling an area equal to her space and her reach combined-resulting in a 100-foot-diameter burst of sonic energy. All creatures in this area of effect take 20d10 points of sonic damage, are permanently deafened, are knocked prone, and are stunned for 1 round. A successful DC 41 Reflex save halves the damage, reduces the deafened condition to 1d4 rounds, and negates the knocked prone and stun effects entirely. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Baphomet	27.00	3276800	Large	23	45, touch 34, flat-footed 45	643	36	26	31	Abyssal resurrection, freedom of movement, supernatural cunning	38		50 ft., fly 50 ft. (good)	Aizerghaul +52/+47/+42/+37 (2d8+28/19-20/x3), gore +40 (2d8+6 plus 2d6 fire plus burn), bite +40 (1d8+6)		10 ft.	10 ft. (20 ft. with glaive)	burn (4d6 fire, DC 40), glaive mastery, powerful charge (gore, 4d8+19 plus 2d6 fire and burn), scroll use	Str 36, Dex 32, Con 38, Int 37, Wis 29, Cha 35	33	+47 (+51 bull rush)	82 (84 vs. bull rush)	AP 77	Aizerghaul Aizerghaul (Abyssal for "Labyrinth's Final Edge") is a uniquely shaped glaive, the head of which consists of a double blade akin to a crescent moon. This blade is made of ivory, but is razor sharp and as hard as adamantine (and possesses all the qualities of that material). It is a +5 lawful-outsider-bane unholy wounding glaive capable of inflicting particularly horrible and painful wounds on good-aligned targets and devils alike. Such a creature must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save each time it's wounded by Aizerghaul or be sickened with pain for as long as the damage caused by the wound persists. Whether the save succeeds or fails, these wounds don't heal naturally and resist magical healing. A character attempting to heal these wounds must succeed at a DC 32 caster level check or the healing has no effect on the injured creature.  Glaive Mastery (Ex) Baphomet is exceptionally skilled at fighting with a glaive. He is treated as a 20th-level fighter for the purposes of fulfilling any feat prerequisites, such as that for Weapon Specialization.  Infernal Brand (Su) The mark of Asmodeus is branded on Baphomet's brow, yet this is no mark of fealty or servitude. Rather, Baphomet has claimed the pentagram-a remnant of the time he spend as the archdevil's prisoner-and now draws power from it. The brand grants him his devil-like abilities of fire immunity and see in darkness. In addition, all devils and worshipers of devils take a -2 penalty on saving throws against Baphomet's special attacks and spell-like abilities. He gains a +4 bonus on caster level checks to penetrate a devil's spell resistance, and automatically penetrates a devil's damage reduction with his glaive and natural attacks.  Language Mastery (Ex) Baphomet can speak, read, and understand all languages.  Scroll Use (Ex) Baphomet can cast spells from any scroll as if he possessed the spell on a spell list. Spells he casts from scrolls always resolve at caster level 27th.  Summon Minotaurs (Sp) Baphomet can summon half-fiend minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs (see page 90), and mythic minotaurs as if casting a summon monster spell. He can summon eight half-fiend minotaurs three times per day, and four mythic minotaurs or one labyrinth minotaur once per day. This ability functions as a swift action, but otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule with 100% chance of success and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.  Supernatural Cunning (Su) Baphomet is never caught flat-footed and gains a +8 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, he's immune to maze spells and can never become lost. He always knows the shortest, most direct route through any maze. After spending 1 minute in any maze, he understands its entire layout implicitly and can teleport to any location using his greater teleport spell-like ability.																												
Bokrug	27.00	3276800	Large	22	45, touch 27, flat-footed 37	645	33	25	22	immortality, insanity (DC 41), spines	38		50 ft., swim 120 ft., air walk	bite +44 (4d8+22/19-20), 2 claws +44 (2d8+22/19-20), sting +44 (3d6+22/19-20 plus poison), tentacle beard +39 (4d6+22 plus grab)		10 ft.	10 ft.	constrict (4d6+22), critical poisoning, mythic power (10/day, surge +1d12), poison, powerful blows (bite, claws, sting, tentacle beard), vengeful dreams	Str 40, Dex 27, Con 42, Int 22, Wis 30, Cha 27	30	+46 (+50 bull rush, grapple, or overrun)	74 (76 vs. bull rush or overrun, 78 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Critical Poisoning (Su) If Bokrug confirms a critical hit with his sting, he injects his foe with 3 doses of poison (this increases the save DC by 4). A foe that is normally immune to poison can be affected by Bokrug's poison in this way, but treats the poisoning as if it had been injected with only 1 dose.  Immortality (Ex) If Bokrug is killed, his body immediately begins to thrash and writhe spasmodically, continuing to do so for 1d4 rounds. During this time, he makes a single sting attack against one random target in reach. At the end of this time, his body grows still, then melts into water and evaporates away. Bokrug reforms in dormancy back in his realm in the Dimension of Dreams soon thereafter, remaining in a comatose state for hundreds of years unless he is awoken earlier via complex rituals. Any effect that destroys Bokrug's body (such as disintegrate) merely reduces his remains to water that then evaporates away as described above, but such measures do prevent his body from thrashing and stinging prior to this supernatural evaporation.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 41; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 2d4 Wisdom damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. A creature whose Wisdom damage equals its Wisdom score automatically becomes afflicted by a random insanity (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spines (Ex) Any creature that makes a melee attack against Bokrug must succeed at a DC 33 Reflex save or be struck by the numerous swiftly reacting spines that cover the Great Old One, taking 2d6+15 points of damage. Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Toxic Breath (Su) Bokrug's breath is toxic. Whenever the Great Old One is above water, he is surrounded by a 30-foot-radius cloud of invisible poison gas that causes temporary madness and hallucinations. Any creature that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that holds its breath or doesn't have to breathe gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw. This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Unspeakable Presence (Su) Failing a DC 33 Will save against Bokrug's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become overwhelmed with hopelessness and doom-it takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls as long as it remains within the area of affect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Vengeful Dreams (Su) Any creature that has ever damaged Bokrug or has slain one of his clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One's vengeful dreams regardless of the distance between the creature and Bokrug, even across planar boundaries. In order to use vengeful dreams against a target, Bokrug must successfully affect the target with his nightmare spell-like ability; the target is always treated as familiar to Bokrug, and as if Bokrug possessed a body part of the victim, resulting in a -15 penalty on the saving throw against the nightmare. If the victim fails its save against the nightmare, the horrific dream unfolds as a vision of Bokrug consuming the victim alive. The victim then remains alive, conscious, and aware as the Great Old One digests it, and as Bokrug destroys all that remains of the victim's lifelong friends, home, belongings, and family. When the victim awakens from the nightmare, it must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or take 3d6 points of Wisdom drain from the vengeful dreams. If this drains the target's Wisdom to 0, it automatically gains a random insanity (GameMastery Guide 250). Once Bokrug uses this ability against a creature, he can't do so again until that creature again damages him or slays one of his clerics. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Dagon	27.00	3280000	Large	12	50, touch 35, flat-footed 42	594	33	20	33		38		20 ft., swim 60 ft.	#ERROR!	#ERROR!	10 ft.	10 ft.	water mastery	Str 37, Dex 27, Con 33, Int 26, Wis 29, Cha 28	36	+52 (+56 bull rush, +54 disarm, +56 grapple, +54 trip)	87 (89 vs. bull rush, 89 vs. disarm, can't be tripped)	Tome of Horrors Complete	Water Mastery (Ex) Dagon gains a +2 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls and a +2 competence bonus to AC i f both he and his opponent are touching water.  Embrace of the Uncaring Sea: Dagon's unique weapon is a +5 unholy mighty cleaving trident. On a successful critical hit, the target must make a DC 39 Fortitude save or begin to drown (see Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). This affects even creatures that can ordinarily breathe underwater or are under the effects of a water breathing spell.  The target is allowed a new saving throw each round. The drowning continues until either the target is dead, a successful save is made, or the effect is successfully dispelled (CL 30th). Even if the effect is successfully removed, another critical hit starts it once again. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +10 racial bonus when used by Dagon.																												
Furcas	27.00	3276800	Huge	7	46, touch 33, flat-footed 39	635	36	28	27	armor of thorns, freedom of movement, hellish resurrection, immovable	38		50 ft.

(25 ft. with trident)	crown of laurels, disease, poison, poison barb, powerful hooves, swat, trample (4d8+22, DC 40)	Str 40, Dex 24, Con 40, Int 29, Wis 33, Cha 31	31	+48 (+52 bull rush, +52 disarm)	83 (immovable 85 vs. bull rush, 85 vs. disarm, 87 vs. trip)	Hell Unleashed	Armor of Thorns (Ex) A network of thorny vines armors and invades Furcas's body. Any creature that strikes Furcas with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon takes 1d8+7 points of piercing damage from the barbs studding the infernal duke's body and must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude saving throw or be poisoned (potentially in addition to the effects of unholy aura). This living, toxic armor also feeds off of all manner of corruption. Any attempt to poison Furcas or magically control his vine armor heals him for 4d6 points of damage. Furcas can also use his poison barbs to heal himself in this way.  Crown of Laurels (Su) Once per day as a move action, Furcas can bestow his laurel crown upon an adjacent creature. For the next 24 hours, the creature is affected as per the spells greater heroism and unholy aura. At the end of this period, these benefits cease and the creature is infected with a particularly resilient form of devil chills (see below). This  version requires six consecutive successful saving throws to cure, and can be magically cured only by a lawful evil spellcaster. Creatures immune to disease suffer no negative effects. The crown always returns to Furcas after 24 hours.  Disease (Su) Devil chills: hooves-injury; save Fort DC 40; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Immovable (Ex) While conscious, Furcas cannot be moved, tripped, or knocked prone by any attack, combat maneuver, spell, or similar effect generated by any creature lesser than a deity or object of less than artifact-level power.  Irresistible Force (Su) Anytime Furcas's attack moves a foe-whether through the use of a combat maneuver, Awesome Blow, telekinesis, or a similar effect-that creature is moved double the normal distance.  Poison (Ex) Poison barb-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect fatigued; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison Barb (Su) As a standard action, Furcas can grow and fire a toxic barb from his body. This is a ranged attack with a range increment of 60 feet. Any creature struck by the barb must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude saving throw or be poisoned. Furcas can decide what type of poison the barb bears, whether his own fatiguing toxin or any poison conveyed through injury that appears on the chart on page 559 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. After using this ability, Furcas cannot grow another barb for 1d4 rounds.  Powerful Hooves (Ex) Furcas's hoof attacks are considered primary attacks. He always adds his full Strength bonus to the amount of damage dealt by his hooves.  Swat (Ex) As a free action, Furcas can use the Awesome Blow feat with his slam attack. Because of his irresistible force ability, any creature affected by this attack is hurled 20 feet.																												
Gibbering Orb	27.00	3276800	Huge	16	48, touch 32, flat-footed 36	337	17	21	24	all-around vision	37		5 ft., fly 20 ft.

The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than five rays at any single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 150 ft. Each of these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: cone of cold, disintegrate, dominate monster, energy drain, feeblemind, finger of death, flesh to stone, greater dispel magic, harm, hold monster, horrid wilting, implosion, inflict critical wounds, lightning bolt, magic missile, mage's disjunction, irresistible dance, baleful polymorph, power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, prismatic spray, slay living, and temporal stasis.  Flight (Ex) The gibbering orb's body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 20 ft. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent feather fall effect with personal range.  Gibbering (Su) The cacophony of speech emanating from the scores of mouths that make up the orb forces all within 60 ft. of the creature to succeed at a DC 29 Will save each round or suffer the effects of an insanity spell.  Steal Spell/Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su) When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature's known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use any two of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see above) that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.																												
Slaad Lord Of The Insane	27.00	3280000	Medium	10	50, touch 24, flat-footed 44	820	39	28	21	amorphous	37		40 ft., fly 60 ft.	3 slam +54 (2d6+13 plus energy drain)		5 ft.	5 ft. (10 ft. with slam)	energy drain	Str 36, Dex 22, Con 40, Int 26, Wis 26, Cha 26	40	53	69	Tome of Horrors Complete	Energy Drain (Su) Living creatures hit by the Slaad Lord's slam attack gain 3 negative levels. The DC is 45 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The DC is Constitution-based. Amorphous (Ex) The Slaad Lord of the Insane is not subject to critical hits, and having no clear front or back, cannot be flanked. Change Shape (Su) The Slaad Lord of the Insane can assume the shape of a humanoid as a standard action. In humanoid form, the slaad lord cannot use its natural weapons and does not deal negative levels. He usually assumes as a human male fighter cloaked in black plate armor wielding an iron black longsword (purportedly the legendary Black Sword: a +3 cold iron longsword that stuns any creature struck, as if by a power word stun spell, for 1d10 minutes if the victim fails a DC 24 Fortitude save).																												
Xoveron	27.00	3276800	Huge	6	45, touch 30, flat-footed 39	643	36	23	33	Abyssal resurrection, freedom of movement	38		50 ft., fly 80 ft.

It this attack hits, he deals 8d8+68 points of bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a successful DC 43 Fortitude save or be knocked prone and staggered for 1d4 rounds. If the target is an object, the attack ignores all hardness possessed by the object. The save DC is Strength-based.  Feed (Su) Xoveron can consume the corpse of a Large or smaller creature that has been dead no longer than a day as a full-round action. Doing so destroys the creature's body and leaves its gear scattered on the ground. All armor and gear worn in the body slot must make a successful DC 43 Fortitude save to avoid becoming broken by this swift and violent consumption. When Xoveron feeds on a creature, he immediately learns all of that creature's memories and knowledge. In addition, he gains the effects of a heal spell and a haste spell (both at CL 27th). The save DC is Strength-based.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dexterity drain; cure 3 consecutive saves. If a creature's Dexterity is drained to 0, the creature is immediately petrified. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Roar (Su) Xoveron can unleash a devastating roar as a standard action once per hour. When he roars, all creatures and unattended objects within 60 feet take 30d10 points of sonic damage and become stunned for 1d6 rounds. Xoveron does not take this damage, and he can exclude any number of creatures or objects from this effect as he wills. A successful DC 40 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Shatter Petrification (Su) Xoveron can strike a petrified creature with any one of his natural weapon attacks to cause it to shatter. The petrified creature can resist this with a successful DC 43 Fortitude save. If the creature fails to resist, the blow smashes it apart into an explosion of razor sharp stone fragments. Any creature within 10 feet of a shattering petrified creature takes 10d6 points of piercing and slashing damage from these flying fragments of once-living flesh (Reflex DC 43 half). Xoveron is never damaged by these flying shards of stone. The save DC is Strength-based.  Shockwave (Su) When Xoveron makes a charge attack while flying and lands at the end of the charge, the force of his landing creates a powerful shockwave. All creatures standing on the ground within 30 feet of Xoveron when he lands at the end of a charge attack must make a successful DC 40 Reflex save to avoid being knocked prone by the force of the impact. The save DC is Constitution-based.																												
Dagon	28.00	4915200	Huge	11	46, touch 31, flat-footed 39	676	37	24	7	Abyssal resurrection, freedom of movement	39		40 ft., swim 120 ft.	bite +48 (6d6+17/19-20 plus grab), 4 tentacles +43 (2d6+8/19-20 plus grab)		15 ft.	15 ft. (30 ft. with tentacle)	breath weapon, command aquatic creature, constrict (2d6+25), fast swallow, poison, swallow whole (transformation, AC 17, 67 hp)	Str 44, Dex 25, Con 40, Int 29, Wis 32, Cha 31	33	14	27 (31 vs. trip)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, Dagon can exhale a 60-foot cone of inky blackness. Underwater, this cone manifests as black ink, while above water it manifests as a thick cloud. Creatures in the area have their vision obscured as if they were in complete darkness. Darkvision does not allow someone to see through the ink or smoke, but true seeing does. The ink or smoke persists for 1d4 rounds, but dissipates in 1 round in areas with aquatic currents or winds. Any creature in the breath weapon's area is exposed to the breath weapon's poison (see below) and must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or gain 2 negative levels as its memories and knowledge leach away (this is a mind-affecting effect). Any creature that enters the ink or cloud, or ends its turn inside it, must succeed at another Will save (at a +4 bonus) to avoid further level loss and poisoning. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Command Aquatic Creature (Su) Dagon can command aquatic creatures to do his bidding as a move action, either via using his ability to speak with animals or via telepathy. This affects all aberrations, animals, magical beasts, oozes, and vermin within 300 feet that have the aquatic subtype (Will DC 36 negates). This functions like mass suggestion, but can affect mindless creatures. Dagon can suggest obviously harmful or suicidal acts (though non-mindless creatures gain a +10 bonus on their saving throws against these suggestions). The commanded course of activity can have a duration of up to 1 hour. If Dagon issues a new command to a creature, the previous command is discarded. Once a creature succeeds at its save against this effect, it is immune to further commands from Dagon for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Breath weapon-contact; save Fort DC 41; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con drain and confused for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Transformation (Su) A creature swallowed by Dagon is assaulted by demonic enzymes, rasping talons, sucking tendrils, and vile gases. At the start of the swallowed creature's turn, it must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be nauseated, and must succeed at a DC 36 Will save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity and Charisma drain. Once the creature's Dexterity and Charisma are drained to 0, the creature transforms into a horrifically deformed version of itself that Dagon can then disgorge into any adjacent square as a swift action. The transformed creature gains the half-fiend template, its Dexterity and Charisma return to their normal values, and it is under Dagon's control (as dominate monster, caster level 28th). The transformation can be reversed by casting break enchantment and atonement on the victim during the first 24 hours (after that, it can be reversed only via miracle or wish). The Fortitude save DC is Constitution-based, and the Will save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Demon Lord, Shax	28.00	4915200	Medium	18	46, touch 38, flat-footed 32	676	26	32	7	absorb blood, Abyssal resurrection, freedom of movement	39		50 ft.	#ERROR!	thrown surgical tool +47/+42/+37/+32 (1d6+10)	5 ft.	5 ft.	command blood, frightful weapon prowess, painful cuts, sneak attack +5d6	Str 30, Dex 39, Con 40, Int 30, Wis 31, Cha 31	33	+19 (+23 grapple)	32 (44 vs. trip)	AP 74	Absorb Blood (Su) If a creature dies while under the effects of Shax's ability to command blood, all of the victim's blood slithers out of its body and moves at a speed of 60 feet toward Shax. If the slithering blood reaches Shax, it flows up onto his body and is absorbed, affecting Shax as a heal spell (CL 28th). A slithering pool of blood can be destroyed by any amount of fire damage applied to it before it reaches its goal, or by the application of an effect that transmutes liquid to something other than blood.  Aura of Bleeding Wounds (Su) Whenever a creature takes piercing or slashing damage within 30 feet of Shax, it takes an additional 1d6 points of bleed damage. This bleed damage stacks with itself, up to a maximum of 10d6 points. As a free action, Shax may designate any number of creatures within the aura to be exempt from this effect.  Command Blood (Su) As a swift action, Shax can command the blood of any creature that is currently suffering from bleed damage to do his bidding. The target must be within 60 feet of Shax for him to use this ability. The target can resist this ability with a successful DC 36 Fortitude save. If the target fails the save, Shax can command the victim's blood to behave in one of the manners listed below. Once commanded, the blood continues to function in this way for as long as the victim continues to bleed. Shax can change the effect in a subsequent round by using this ability again, but no more than one of the following effects can be in effect at any one time. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Blinding Blood: The victim's blood runs up into its eyes and blinds it at the start of its turn unless the victim takes a move action to wipe away the blood. Once a victim is blinded in this way, it remains blinded as long as the bleed effect continues.  Bloody Mess: The victim's blood spreads out across its body, making it slippery. This grants a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and all attempts to resist being grappled, but the victim must succeed at a DC 36 Reflex save at the start of each round or drop objects it holds. These effects last as long as the bleed effect continues.  Choking Blood: The target's blood runs up into its nostrils and mouth unless the creature uses a free hand to pinch its nose shut and holds its breath. If the target doesn't do so, the blood runs into its lungs and the creature must succeed at a Constitution check each round or it begins to drown.  Once a victim begins to drown, it continues to do so as long as the bleed effect persists.  Gruesome Tendrils: This effect automatically ends any bleed effects the victim is currently suffering as it causes the blood coating the victim to solidify into thin, whiplike tendrils that lash out at any creature within 5 feet. Any creature that begins its turn in this area automatically takes 1d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of bleed damage; a successful DC 36 Reflex save prevents this damage.  Frightful Weapon Prowess (Ex) When an opponent observes Shax's attacks, the frightening display of the demon lord's grace makes the victim take additional damage from those attacks, as if simply imagining the damage were enough to cause injury. Shax gains a profane bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on damage rolls (+10 damage) with all weapon attacks and ranged attacks made against a victim who can observe him. This damage is negated if the victim closes its eyes, but doing so puts the opponent in greater danger from Shax's sneak attacks. This is a visual fear effect.  Master of Lies (Ex) Shax is immune to any magical effect that discerns lies or forces him to speak the truth.  Painful Cuts (Ex) Whenever Shax threatens a critical hit with a slashing weapon, the victim must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be staggered by the pain for 1 round. If the hit was a critical hit, the staggered effect lasts for 1d4 rounds on a failed saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Mogaru	28.00	4915200	Colossal	9	47, touch 7, flat-footed 42	697	34	24	23	absorb energy, ferocity, recovery		susceptible to song	100 ft., swim 100 ft.	bite +46 (8d6+20/19-20 plus grab), 2 claws +46 (4d8+20/19-20), 2 tail slaps +44 (6d6+10/19-20)	firebolts +31 touch (damage variable; see below)	60 ft.	60 ft.	breath weapon, ferocity, fast swallow, hurl foe, reflexive breath, swallow whole (10d6 bludgeoning and 10d6 fire damage, AC 30, 69 hp), trample (4d8+30, DC 47)	Str 50, Dex 21, Con 41, Int 3, Wis 30, Cha 26	34	+62 (+66 bull rush, +66 grapple, +66 sunder)	79 (81 vs. bull rush, 81 vs. sunder)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Absorb Energy (Ex) Mogaru absorbs energy attacks that damage him, including negative energy attacks. Damage blocked by one of his resistances or immunities instead heals him an amount equal to the damage dealt. He may absorb only one kind of energy in this manner in a round. The first type of energy that affects him in a round (whether or not it penetrates his immunities or resistance to actually damage him) sets the type of energy he absorbs for that round. Hit points gained in excess of his normal maximum are lost. Mogaru cannot gain healing from energy effects generated by himself.  Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 4 rounds, Mogaru can breathe out a beam of fiery red force. When Mogaru uses this attack, he can choose to focus the breath weapon into a single 1,200-foot-long line, or he can shorten the range and turn his head and body while breathing, effectively affecting a 600-foot-long cone. All creatures caught in this area of effect take 20d6 points of fire damage, 20d6 points of force damage, and are staggered for 1d6 rounds from the devastating energy (Reflex DC 42 halves the damage and prevents the staggered effect). A creature slain by this effect is disintegrated, whether the saving throw was successful or not. This breath weapon is particularly effective at blasting through cover-cover does not grant any bonuses on Reflex saves against Mogaru's breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Firebolts (Su) As a standard action on any round immediately following the use of his breath weapon, Mogaru can fire bolts of red energy from the glowing spines along his back. These bolts are ranged touch attacks with a range of 1,200 feet. When Mogaru uses this ability, he must choose between firing one firebolt, three firebolts, or six firebolts. If he fires one, it deals 20d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires three bolts, each deals 8d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires six bolts, each deals 5d6 points of damage on a hit. Half of the damage caused by any one firebolt is fire damage, the other half is force damage. Firebolts deal full damage against objects, and ignore the first 10 points of hardness possessed by an object.  Reflexive Breath (Ex) The first time in any round that Mogaru can make an attack of opportunity, he can choose to use a diminished version of his breath weapon instead of making a physical attack. This reflexive breath weapon attack only targets the creature that provoked the attack of opportunity, but otherwise causes the same damage and effects his breath weapon normally inflicts (Reflex DC 32 halves the damage and negates the staggered effect). Use of his breath weapon in this way does not affect the recharge rate of the regular breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a -10 penalty to reflect the fact that the reflexive breath is a shorter (but no less intense) blast of energy than the kaiju's typical breath weapon attack.  Sense Kaiju (Su) Mogaru can sense the location of the nearest active kaiju, as if using discern location, at will.  Susceptible to Song (Ex) Mogaru's actions can be influenced by song, provided the kaiju notices the singing. If the kaiju is not currently engaged in battle, he automatically hears any song within 100 feet that is directed at him in an attempt to influence him, but when he is in combat, there's only a cumulative 20% chance per round of sustained singing that he notices the song. In order to influence Mogaru, the singer must make a DC 35 Perform (sing) check (this check cannot be bolstered by the aid another action, and the singer cannot take 10 or 20 on the check). The result of this check sets the DC of the Will save Mogaru must make in order to not be influenced by the song. The singer can choose to influence Mogaru as if she had successfully cast suggestion on the kaiju (CL = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing]). If Mogaru succeeds at a Will save (DC = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing] + the singer's Charisma modifier), the effects of the influence last for a maximum of 1d4 rounds; otherwise, the effects last as long as a suggestion spell would normally last. Mogaru cannot use his recovery ability to recover from song influence, and a single singer may influence Mogaru only once per day.																												
Pazuzu	28.00	4920000	Large	14	49, touch 37, flat-footed 39	604	31	23	30	aerial passivism	39		40 ft., fly 80 ft. (perfect)	#ERROR!		10 ft.	10 ft.	breath weapons, dominate aerial creatures	Str 35, Dex 30, Con 31, Int 28, Wis 28, Cha 29	39	52	90	Tome of Horrors Complete	Aerial Passivism (Ex) No aerial creature (defined in his dominate aerial creatures special attack) of 10 HD or less willingly attacks Pazuzu (but can be forced to magically).  If attacked by a magically compelled aerial creature, Pazuzu can make an Intelligence check (opposed by the spellcaster's caster level that compelled the aerial creature). If Pazuzu wins the opposed check, he automatically breaks the magical compulsion controlling the creature (as if by greater dispel magic).  Breath Weapons (Su) Pazuzu has three breath weapons, each detailed below. Regardless of which breath weapon he uses, he can't breathe more than once every 1d4 rounds. Each breath weapon is a 100-foot long cone. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus for Pazuzu's Ability Focus feat.  Creeping Doom: This works as the spell of the same name (CL 20th).  Insect Plague: This works as the spell of the same name (CL 20th).  Corrosive Gas: Damage 16d6 acid, DC 40 Reflex half.  Dominate Aerial Creatures (Su) Pazuzu can automatically dominate any aerial creature of 6 HD or less that is within sight as a free action. Targeted creatures do not get a save against this effect. This functions as a charm monster spell (CL 20th). At any one time, Pazuzu can have a total of 40 HD of creatures dominated. Affected creatures must remain with sight or the effect ends. Aerial creatures are defined as avians (including giant and dire versions), gargoyles, harpies, and creatures with the air subtype.  Carriontooth: Pazuzu's unique weapon is a +5 anarchic keen greatsword.																												
Sifkesh	28.00	4915200	Medium	12	49, touch 43, flat-footed 36	666	30	33	30	critical healing, freedom of movement, heretical	39		30 ft., fly 120 ft. (perfect)	#ERROR!		5 ft.	30 ft.	Charisma drain, despairing cry, precise cuts, suicide	Str 32, Dex 35, Con 42, Int 33, Wis 29, Cha 36	31	42	85 (can't be tripped)	AP 75	Charisma Drain (Su) Sifkesh's claw leaves hideous scars that resist healing even via magic; these scars manifest as Charisma drain. The more scars a victim gains in this manner, the more despondent and depressed its personality grows. A creature whose Charisma score is drained to 3 or lower by this attack automatically fails any Will save against any spell-like ability or supernatural attack made by Sifkesh. A successful DC 41 Will save resists the Charisma drain inflicted by this attack, and instead causes the victim to be sickened for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Critical Healing (Ex) Critical hits cause Sifkesh to experience a sudden rush of energy and healing. Any additional damage dealt to Sifkesh by a critical hit actually heals her of that amount of damage rather than harming her. This damage applies simultaneously to the attack's normal damage, and can prevent her from being slain if the damage from the normal attack would otherwise have been enough to kill her. Sifkesh takes no damage at all (but neither does she gain healing) from critical hits she or her allies deal to her-only attempts to actually damage her can heal her in this way. Whenever Sifkesh is healed of any damage in this manner, she becomes hasted for 1 round. Sifkesh takes normal damage from sneak attacks and other precision-based damage.  Despairing Cry (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Sifkesh can unleash a soul-rending mournful scream that affects all creatures in a 60-foot-radius spread. A creature in this area must attempt a successful DC 38 Will save or be overcome by suicidal despair-on a successful save, a creature is merely sickened for 1d4 rounds. A creature fully affected by this special attack takes a -6 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls, and cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonus for 24 hours. A creature that is normally immune to fear loses that ability while under the effects of despairing cry, and can be ordered to take obviously suicidal acts while under the influence of effects like charm person, dominate person, and suggestion. The effects of multiple despairing cries do not stack. This is a mind-affecting sonic curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Detached Limbs (Su) Sifkesh's arms, legs, and head are not physically attached to her torso. Instead, they float in approximately the positions they would normally take up, but never quite perfectly aligned. She is immune to any effect that severs limbs or her head. In addition, when she attacks, her limbs can move with surprising speed, effectively granting her exceptional reach for a Medium creature.  Heretical (Ex) Sifkesh's heretical persona protects her from servants of faith. Against any spell cast by a divine spellcaster, her Spell Resistance increases to 41, and she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against such spells. A divine spellcaster who willingly touches Sifkesh must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Immune to Edged Weapons (Ex) Sifkesh is immune to all forms of slashing damage and bleed effects.  Precise Cuts (Ex) Sifkesh deals an amount of additional damage equal to her Intelligence bonus on any successful attack that deals slashing damage.  Suicide (Su) Once per day as an immediate action, Sifkesh can drop her defenses when attacked by a foe. She is treated as flat-footed for this attack, loses her profane bonus to her AC and spell resistance, and automatically fails any saving throws against that attack. If this attack kills her, she immediately utters her despairing cry (even if she's already used it within the previous 1d4 rounds). Any creatures affected by this particular despairing cry are also stunned for 1d4 rounds. One round after she commits suicide, Sifkesh automatically comes back to life, as if affected by true resurrection.																												
Vildeis	28.00	4915200	Large	13	44, touch 19, flat-footed 34	610	31	20	26				40 ft., fly 60 ft. (average)	Cicatrix +50/+45/+40/+35 (1d6+17/17-20 plus 1 bleed and 2d6 vicious)	Cicatrix +47 (1d6+17/17-20 plus 1 bleed)	10 ft.	10 ft.	smite evil 7/day (+5 attack and AC, +20 damage, disintegrate evil outsiders)	Str 35, Dex 29, Con 37, Int 18, Wis 22, Cha 21	33	46	66	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Primal Aura (Su) Whenever Vildeis would be affected by a bleed effect, all enemies within 30 feet gain that bleeding condition instead, as though they were the effect's original targets (no saving throw, creatures immune to bleeding are immune to this effect). The Heal DC to stop this bleeding is 25.  Smite Evil (Su) Vildeis can smite evil as a 20th-level paladin. Whenever she uses smite evil and successfully strikes an evil outsider, the outsider is also subject to disintegrate, using Vildeis's paladin level as the caster level. After the disintegrate effect and the damage from the attack are resolved, the smite effect immediately ends.  Spells Vildeis casts spells as a 20th-level paladin.  Zealous Vision (Su) Vildeis automatically pinpoints the location of any evil creature within 1,000 feet of her.																												
Deskari	29.00	6553600	Gargantuan	14	47, touch 32, flat-footed 37	742	31	32	12	Abyssal resurrection, all-around vision, freedom of movement, rasping armor	40		60 ft., climb 60 ft., fly 90 ft. (good)	Riftcarver +51/+46/+41/+36 (4d6+30/19-20/x4 plus poison), bite +41 (2d8+8 plus poison), sting +41 (2d6+8 plus poison)		20 ft.	20 ft.	breath weapon, enhanced venom, infestation, poison, swarm master	Str 44, Dex 30, Con 42, Int 29, Wis 31, Cha 31	33	14	26	AP 78	Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Deskari can spit out a line of noxious black slime in a 120- foot line that creates a 20-foot-radius-spread puddle of the stuff on the ground where the line terminates. Any creature caught in this area of effect takes 20d10 points of acid damage and is subject to the effects of Deskari's poison. A successful DC 42 Reflex save halves the damage, but does not mitigate the poison's effects. The line and puddle created by this attack remain as active acid on the ground for 1d4 rounds, affecting any creatures that move through an affected area. Damage caused by this breath weapon does not persist into additional rounds, but on the round a creature takes this damage, it is considered to be taking continuous damage for the purposes of spellcasting and concentration checks. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Enhanced Venom (Su) Any poisons created by Deskari (or even those used by him) become enhanced, and can affect creatures normally immune to poison. If an affected creature is mythic and is normally immune to poison, it instead receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw against Deskari's poison effects.  Infestation (Su) Whenever a creature becomes poisoned by Deskari, it also becomes infested with thousands of microscopic demonic eggs that quickly multiply and spread throughout the victim's bloodstream and flesh alike. Once infested, a creature remains infested even after the poison's effects end or are cured. A creature that has been infested by Deskari is recognized by all mindless swarms as a host, and such swarms never deal damage to the creature unless influenced and compelled to do so by an outside influence. An infested creature takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made against Deskari's attacks or spells cast by his clerics. As a swift action, Deskari may command a creature's infestation to accelerate; this deals 20d6 points of damage and stuns the target for 1 round (a successful DC 42 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect) as the eggs hatch and a fiendish locust swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 183) bursts out of the creature's body (ending the infestation). Infestation is a disease effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison (Ex) Bite, breath weapon, sting, or Riftcarver-injury; save Fort DC 42; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution drain plus infestation; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Rasping Armor (Su) The armor plates that protect Deskari's body rasp together whenever he is damaged by a physical attack, creating a discordant shrieking and grinding sound. Every time a creature strikes Deskari with an attack that deals bludgeoning, force, piercing, or slashing damage, all creatures within 10 feet of Deskari must succeed at a DC 42 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. A sickened creature that fails this save becomes staggered for 1 round. A staggered creature that fails this save becomes nauseated for 1 round. Finally, a nauseated creature that fails this save becomes stunned for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect that does not affect demons. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Swarm Master (Su) Deskari is immune to swarm damage and other swarm effects (such as distraction). As a swift action, he can direct the movement of any swarm within 30 feet. An intelligent swarm can resist this compulsion by succeeding at a DC 36 Will save. Any swarm created by or conjured by Deskari deals +3d6 points of swarm damage, and the damage caused by such a swarm is treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Swarmsight (Su) Deskari can see through the eyes of any swarm he commands or controls, including the swarm of biting flies that makes up his wings (this swarm, incidentally, grants him all-around vision).  Wall Crawler (Su) Deskari can climb any vertical surface with ease and never has to attempt Climb checks to avoid falling as a result of taking damage. This grants him a +16 racial bonus on Climb checks.																												
Fraz-urb'luu	29.00	6560000	Huge	8	49, touch 29, flat-footed 45	900	41	17	29		40		40 ft., fly 60 ft.

The summoned lord or prince must succeed on a DC 44 Will save. If the save fails, it believes that Fraz-Urb'luu's opponents called it and deals with them appropriately (which usually involves killing the offending party for daring to call a demon prince or lord). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +15 racial bonus. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.																												
Geryon	29.00	6560000	Huge	9	46, touch 29, flat-footed 41	612	25	24	28		40		20 ft., fly 50 ft.

The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 39; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d6 Con; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Bull's Horn: Geryon carries a great horn made of bone. As a full-round action, he can blow this horn and summon 5d4 fiendish minotaurs. The minotaurs appear immediately and act on his turn. They remain and do his bidding until their death. This horn can be blown three times per week. Good-aligned creatures touching the horn take 5d6 points of electricity damage each round they touch it (no save).																												
Hastur	29.00	6553600	Medium	26	48, touch 37, flat-footed 31	731	28	27	29	freedom of movement, immortality, insanity (DC 40)	40		80 ft.	4 tattered lash +41 (2d8+7 plus bleed)		5 ft.	40 ft.	bleed (1d6), fulvous dreams, mythic power (10/ day, surge +1d12), reveal visage, sneak attack +10d6, Yellow Sign	Str 24, Dex 43, Con 44, Int 35, Wis 31, Cha 36	25	41	69 (can't be tripped)	PFRPG Bestiary 4	Fulvous Dreams (Su) When Hastur uses his nightmare spell-like ability on a creature that has seen the Yellow Sign, he also afflicts that creature with horrifying dreams tinted with a nauseating yellow color and thick with overwhelming sensations of decadence, shame, and entropic disorder. In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must also succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be compelled to seek out a Yellow Sign, throwing all of his resources and actions into the obsession. While obsessed, the target takes a -4 penalty on Will saving throws, saving throws against symbol spells, concentration checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks. This obsession effect ends immediately if the victim looks upon the Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Immortality (Ex) If Hastur is slain, the robes that drape his frame suddenly drop to the ground as if whatever shape supported them had suddenly ceased to exist. The robes themselves remain inanimate on the ground, but any humanoid creature that touches them must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to resist a sudden urge to put the robes on. Doing so is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once it has donned Hastur's robes, the creature immediately perishes and its body is destroyed. In its place, Hastur lives again, as if brought back via true resurrection. If the discarded robes are not donned within 24 hours, they fade away, leaving behind a faint yellow stain. In this case, Hastur can't manifest a physical body again until the conditions are right, or until an unwitting cultist or fool calls him forth once again. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Reveal Visage (Su) As a swift action, Hastur may reveal to one adjacent creature the true shape beneath his robes. The creature must succeed at DC 40 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain at the end of its turn each round the paralysis lasts, though the revelation is too awful for memory to retain. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Tattered Lash (Ex) Hastur attacks with long strips of his tattered yellow robes. These strips have a reach of 40 feet and are primary natural slashing attacks. Bleed damage from the strips stacks with itself (up to 10d6 points of bleed damage). Hastur treats insane targets as if they were flat-footed when he attacks with these weapons.  Unspeakable Presence (Su) Failing a DC 40 Will save against Hastur's unspeakable presence afflicts a creature with a random insanity. A creature that is already insane instead becomes confused for as long as it remains in the area. The save DC is Charisma-based. Wish (Sp) Although Hastur may use wish as a spell-like ability at will, he can do so only to grant the wishes of other creatures, and only once per creature. Invariably, the results of these wishes serve somehow to advance Hastur's agenda.  Yellow Sign (Su) Once per day as a free action, Hastur can touch any solid surface and inscribe the Yellow Sign upon it. Once inscribed, the Yellow Sign remains for a year, but is active only on certain nights when the light from Hastur's distant world shines in the night sky as a star. Any creature that looks upon an active Yellow Sign must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to avoid becoming dominated by Hastur (as dominate monster); whether or not the save is successful, the creature doesn't have to save against that Yellow Sign again for 24 hours. While the creature is under this domination effect, if the creature's Charisma drain plus Charisma damage ever equal its Charisma score, it immediately dies and allows Hastur to manifest physically at the location of its corpse, as if the victim had donned Hastur's tattered robes (see immortality). A Yellow Sign can be removed with dispel chaos, dispel evil, or erase, any of which requires the caster to succeed at a DC 35 caster level check. Mage's disjunction automatically removes a Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Slaad Lord Of Entropy	29.00	6560000	Large	12	53, touch 26, flat-footed 45	888	41	36	27		40		40 ft.	#ERROR!		10 ft.	10 ft.		Str 36, Dex 27, Con 37, Int 28, Wis 28, Cha 26	48	62	80	Tome of Horrors Complete	Death Stroke (Su) If the Slaad Lord of Entropy scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with his scythe and confirms the critical hit, that opponent must succeed on a DC 35 Fortitude save or die. Creatures slain can be raised normally, but there is only a 50% chance that such magic works. Even if the Fortitude save succeeds, a creature struck takes 8d6 points of damage (which may be enough to kill it anyway). This ability only functions in the hands of the Slaad Lord of Entropy.																												
Cernunnos	30.00	9830400	Large	16	48, touch 22, flat-footed 35	663	25	31	25	freedom of movement, lightning rod, unbound	41		40 ft., fly 60 ft.

He can have only one such arrow at a time, and it only functions for him. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Horned Lord's Charge (Ex) An opponent hit by Cernunnos's powerful charge must succeed at a DC 39 Fort save or be exhausted, sickened, or stunned (Cernunnos's choice) for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Lightning Rod (Su) Cernunnos absorbs and negates any electricity effect that targets him or includes him in its area. As an immediate action on his next turn, he can release this energy to grant the shock weapon special ability to all weapons wielded by his allies within 30 feet for 1 round.  Perfect Archer (Ex) Cernunnos does not provoke attacks of opportunity for firing bow weapons in melee. He threatens squares out to his normal reach when wielding a bow. He automatically creates arrows when firing a bow and treats any bow he wields as if it had a range increment of 500 feet.  Primal Aura (Su) Any summoned animal or creature summoned by summon nature's ally gains a +4 enhancement bonus to its Strength and Constitution while within Cernunnos's aura. Any such creature summoned within his aura obeys him as if he had summoned it (if given conflicting orders, the creature obeys Cernunnos instead of its summoner).  Spells Cernunnos casts spells as 20th-level druid.  Unbound (Su) Cernunnos is immune to any effects that restrict or force extradimensional movement upon him, such as banishment or dimensional anchor. He may allow these effects to affect him.																												
Cthulhu	30.00	9830400	Colossal	15	49, touch 29, flat-footed 44	774	29	29	33	freedom of movement, immortality, insanity (DC 40), non-euclidean	41		60 ft., fly 200 ft.

Make one attack roll; any creature in the area whose AC is equal to or lower than the result takes damage from the claw.  Dreams of Madness (Su) When Cthulhu uses his nightmare spell-like ability on a creature with one or more ranks in a Craft or Perform skill, he also afflicts the creature with maddening dreams. In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or contract a random insanity (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250). This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that already has an insanity is immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Greater Starflight (Su) Cthulhu can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through outer space at incredible speeds. Although the exact travel time will vary from one trip to the next, a trip within a solar system normally takes Cthulhu 2d6 hours, and a trip beyond normally takes 2d6 days (or more, at the GM's discretion).  Immortality (Ex) If Cthulhu is killed, his body immediately fades away into a noxious cloud of otherworldly vapor that fills an area out to his reach. This cloud blocks vision as obscuring mist, but can't be dispersed by any amount of wind. Any creature in this area must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains in the cloud and for an additional 1d10 rounds after it leaves the area. Cthulhu returns to life after 2d6 rounds, manifesting from the cloud and restored to life via true resurrection, but is staggered for 2d6 rounds (nothing can remove this staggered effect). If slain again while he is staggered from this effect, Cthulhu reverts to vapor form again and his essence fades away after 2d6 rounds, returning to his tomb in R'lyeh until he is released again. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Non-Euclidean (Ex) Cthulhu does not exist wholly in the physical world, and space and time strain against his presence. This grants Cthulhu a deflection bonus to AC and a racial bonus on Reflex saves equal to his Charisma modifier (+12). His apparent and actual position are never quite the same, granting him a 50% miss chance against all attacks. True seeing can defeat this miss chance, but any creature that looks upon Cthulhu while under the effects of true seeing must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be afflicted by a random insanity (this is a mind-affecting effect). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Tentacles (Ex) Cthulhu's tentacles are a primary attack.  Unspeakable Presence (Su) Failing a DC 40 Will save against Cthulhu's unspeakable presence causes the victim to immediately die of fright. This is a death and fear effect. A creature immune to fear that fails its save against Cthulhu's unspeakable presence is staggered for 1d6 rounds instead of killed. The save DC is Charisma-based.																												
Nocticula	30.00	9830400	Medium	13	48, touch 41, flat-footed 35	774	32	37	35	Abyssal resurrection, freedom of movement	41		60 ft., fly 90 ft. (good)	2 claws +48 (1d8+12 plus 1d4 Cha drain), 3 stings +48 (2d6+12/19-20 plus poison), 2 hooves +43 (1d4+6 plus 1d6 fire and burn), 2 wings +43 (1d4+6)	Shadowkiss +54/+49/+44/+39 (1d4+20/17-20 plus poison)	5 ft.	5 ft.	burn (3d6 fire, DC 44), cruel shot, domination, energy drain, poison, profane ascension, sneak attack +4d6	Str 34, Dex 36, Con 42, Int 35, Wis 32, Cha 40	36	48	89	AP 76	Cruel Shot (Ex) Nocticula is adept at making ranged attacks to strike cruel shots that deal significant and humiliating damage. She adds her Charisma bonus to all damage dealt by ranged weapons.  Domination (Su) As a standard action, Nocticula can crush a foe's will. The target must be visible to Nocticula and within 120 feet. It must succeed at a DC 43 Will save or fall instantly under Nocticula's influence as dominate monster (CL 30th). If she uses domination against a humanoid creature, she may instead choose to use the ability as a swift action, and it functions as dominate person. As long as the target is under this effect, it gains a +4 profane bonus on all saving throws against targets other than Nocticula.  Energy Drain (Su) Nocticula's energy drain functions identically to that of a succubus (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 68), except that she drains 2 levels when she uses this ability against mythic creatures, or 1d6+4 levels against non-mythic creatures.  Poison (Ex) Sting or hand crossbow-injury; save Fort DC 44; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Wisdom drain plus paralysis for 1 round. Anyone who fails two consecutive saves against this poison is permanently blinded. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Profane Ascension (Su) As a swift action while in an act of passion with a willing mortal, Nocticula may grant a profane ascension. The target's name appears in glowing Abyssal runes on Nocticula's wings, and a crimson mark manifests somewhere on the target's body. The target immediately gains a +6 profane bonus to any one ability score of its choice, a +4 profane bonus to any other ability score of its choice, and the see in darkness ability. A single creature may have only one profane ascension in effect at any one time. As long as the effect persists, Nocticula can communicate telepathically with the target across any distance and may use any of her spell-like abilities through the target, manifesting them as if the target were using them. A profane ascension may be removed by a miracle or wish. Nocticula can remove it as a free action, dealing 4d6 points of Charisma drain and imparting 1d10+10 permanent negative levels to the victim.  Seductive Presence (Su) Unlike most demon lords, Nocticula does not possess a frightful presence ability. Rather, she has a seductive presence that she can activate as a free action whenever she speaks or uses a spell-like ability. Anyone within 180 feet who fails a DC 43 Fortitude save loses any immunity to mind-affecting effects, charm effects, and compulsion effects, and becomes fascinated by Nocticula for 5d4 rounds. A creature affected by a mind-affecting effect while within this aura remains affected even after leaving Nocticula's seductive presence. Creatures that succeed at this saving throw are immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shadowkiss Nocticula's favored weapon is Shadowkiss, a +5 unholy hand crossbow that magically creates ammunition as it fires. Once a target is damaged by a bolt fired from Shadowkiss, the hand crossbow gains the bane weapon special ability against that target's creature type on all further attacks. Shadowkiss may only have one bane effect in place at one time. Bolts fired from Shadowkiss gain the ghost touch ability (an effect not normally available to ranged weapons).  Swift Transformation (Ex) Nocticula can use her change shape ability as a free action.																												
Pazuzu	30.00	9830400	Large	13	48, touch 38, flat-footed 39	752	31	32	35	Abyssal resurrection, avian mastery, freedom of movement	41		60 ft., fly 150 ft.

In any round in which he does not move more than 5 feet, he is surrounded by a 10-foot-radius spread of these creatures. Any creature that enters this area must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Avian Mastery (Su) Any creature flying under its own power (flight from a source other than a spell, spell-like ability, or magic item) that attempts to attack Pazuzu with a melee attack must attempt a DC 40 Will save. If it fails, the creature can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack Pazuzu for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Hear Name (Su) Pazuzu hears his name whenever it is spoken, regardless of distance-this ability functions even across planar boundaries. If a creature speaks Pazuzu's name aloud three times in the same breath, Pazuzu automatically knows that creature's precise location and name. If Pazuzu is on the same plane as someone who speaks his name three times in a single breath, he can immediately attempt to possess that creature.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 43; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Wisdom drain and nauseated; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Possession (Su) Once per day as a swift action, Pazuzu can attempt to possess a single living creature within 1 mile, provided he knows the target's name. The target can resist this possession attempt by succeeding at a DC 43 Will save. A lawful creature gains a +10 bonus on this saving throw, and a good creature gains a +20 bonus on the saving throw (these bonuses stack). If the creature successfully saves, it is immune to possession attempts by Pazuzu for the rest of its life. If the saving throw fails, Pazuzu can control the possessed creature from afar. While possessing a creature, Pazuzu automatically knows every thought that creature has. By concentrating, he can sense the creature's surroundings using that creature's senses. As a swift action, he can cause the creature to perform any ability it can perform on its own. Pazuzu can use any of his spell-like abilities through a possessed target, with the effects resolving as if the possessed creature had created the effect. Possession is permanent, but Pazuzu can only possess one creature at a time. When Pazuzu isn't actively controlling the target, it can take its own actions. Dispel chaos or dispel evil ends this possession effect as if it were an enchantment spell, but unless the caster of the spell succeeds at a DC 30 caster level check, as a swift action Pazuzu can attempt to possess the caster as he is driven out of the target. A creature possessed by Pazuzu is immune to protection from evil, magic circle against evil, and any similar effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Profane Wishcraft (Su) A creature that accepts a wish from Pazuzu immediately becomes chaotic evil unless it succeeds at a DC 43 Will save. A creature that becomes chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a good hope spell for 1 week, followed by the effects of crushing despair for 1d6 months (CL 30th). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Swarm Master (Su) Pazuzu is immune to swarm damage and other swarm effects (such as distraction). As a swift action, he can direct the movement of any swarm within 30 feet.

Against such effects it is considered to automatically make any required saving throws.  Energy Resistance (Ex) The Ravager possesses energy resistance against all forms of energy attack (fire, cold, electricity, acid, and sonic).  Form-Shifting (Ex) The Ravager can physically alter its physiology to take on one of the three listed forms: the crawler, the brawler, or the flier. Doing so takes one minute, and during this period it cannot take any other actions, though it is not considered helpless.  Magic Disruption (Su) Every time the Ravager comes into contact with a spell or spell-like or supernatural effect, there is a chance as indicated above that the magic does not affect it. In the case of ongoing effects, a new check is made each round.  Regeneration (Ex) The Ravager and its brood treat all damage as subdual, except damage from epic-level weapons and artifacts.  Trample (Ex) The Ravager gains its vampiric healing ability on this damage where appropriate. The Ravager does not have this ability in its flier form. Instead, it gains Snatch as a bonus feat.  Vampiric Healing (Su) Whenever the Ravager hits with a melee attack, it is healed hit points equal to half the damage it inflicts on its opponent. This ability cannot heal it above its natural maximum hit points. This ability extends to its trample special attack, where applicable.

Creatures attacking Tsathogga unarmed or with natural weapons take 2d8 points of acid damage each time one of their attacks hits. Any weapon striking Tsathogga's acidic body likewise takes acid damage. Blasphemous Croak (Su) Three times per day, Tsathogga can unleash a piercing croak that affects all non-evil creatures within a 100-foot radius as if by a blasphemy spell (CL 20th). There is no save against the effects. Seeping Darkness (Su) As a free action, Tsathogga can billow forth a cloud of thick, dark fog from his skin. This fog spreads to fill a 50-foot radius, 50 feet high. The darkness generated by the cloud nullifies nonmagical lights and magical lights of 5th level or lower within the area. Furthermore, all creatures in the area gain concealment, including those that can normally see in such darkness, tough Tsathogga is able to see normally in it. Light descriptor spells of 5th level or lower (such as daylight, dancing lights, and light) are incapable of brightening the area. This cloud remains for 10 minutes before dispersing. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round. Tsathogga cannot use this ability underwater. Once the cloud disperses, Tsathogga can issue a new one if he desires.

The save DC is Constitution-based. Wand of Orcus: Mighty Orcus wields a huge black skull-tipped rod that functions as a Large +5 unholy greatclub. It slays any living creature it touches if the target fails a DC 40 Fortitude save. Orcus, can at will, shut this ability off so as to allow his wand to pass into the Material Plane (and usually into the hands of one of his servants). Further, the Wand has the following powers (Caster Level 20th; save DC 25 + spell level): - 3/day-animate dead, deeper darkness, desecrate, fear, unhallow • 2/day-blasphemy, unholy aura

Each time the victim takes Con damage, it must succeed on a second Fort save or lose 2 points of the Con damage permanently. The save DC is Constitution-based. Transfixing Gaze (Su) A living creature within 30 feet that meets the Oinodaemon's gaze must succeed on a DC 46 Will save, or be held (as the hold person spell, CL 37th). An affected creature can attempt a new save each round to break the effects if it has 24 HD or more; otherwise, only the Oinodaemon can release it, or a wish or miracle can break the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the Oinodaemon is slain or moves more than 30 feet away from a held creature, it is automatically released. The Oinodaemon only has to remain within range to maintain this ability; he does not have to concentrate.

He may use one each round as a standard action. Each gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet and has a save DC of 47 (CL 39th). The save DC is Charisma-based. Descent into Evil: Any creature meeting Lucifer's gaze must make a successful Will save or have his alignment shift one step toward lawful evil on the law-chaos axis or the good- evil axis. A lawful evil creature is unaffected by this gaze attack. A successful save renders a creature immune to this gaze weapon for one day. Curse: Any creature meeting Lucifer's gaze must succeed at a Will save or be affected as if by a double-strength bestow curse spell (-12 to one ability score or -6 to two ability scores; or -8 enhancement penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks; or each turn the target has a 25% chance to act normally, otherwise he takes no action; Lucifer chooses the curse when he uses this special attack). A successful save renders a creature immune to this gaze weapon for one day. This curse can be dispelled by making a caster level check against DC 50. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 48; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 2d6 Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.. The save DC is Constitution-based. Rod of Infernus Lucifer's black iron rod functions as a Huge +6 trident that he can wield without penalty. It has the following abilities: Annihilation Ray: Once per round, and no more than five times per day, the rod can fire a ray to a range of 60 feet. A creature struck by this ray must succeed on a DC 40 Fortitude save or be annihilated instantly-not even a trace of dust is left behind. No form of mortal magic can restore life to a creature annihilated by this ray. Lucifer or a deity can restore the annihilated creature to life using magic. Rod of Rulership: The rod has all of the abilities and powers of a rod of rulership. Trap the Soul: Once per round, and no more than three times per day, the rod can fire a ray of hellish-red energy to a range of 60 feet that functions as a trap the soul spell (CL 20th). A target can make a DC 40 Will save to resist the effects. If failed, the victim's soul vanishes into Lucifer's rod. Up to 10 such souls can be held in the rod at one time. A trapped soul may be freed by grasping the rod and speaking a command word. Any non-devil that touches the rod takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches the rod. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 40 and can result in actual level loss on a failed save. The negative levels cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the rod is wielded. Any goodaligned creature that touches the rod takes 3d6 points of Constitution drain each round it touches the rod (DC 40 Fortitude save for half). Hell's Redoubt: Hell's Redoubt is Lucifer's Large suit of +5 heavy fortification banded mail that has no armor check penalty, speed penalty, and no chance for arcane spell failure. It was personally crafted for him the hands of Cheshimiboth, Armorer of the Nine Hells, just prior to the Great Uprising. To reward this unique devil's genius for crafting, Lucifer had him murdered in the first moments of the Uprising to prevent him from ever revealing any vulnerability in the armor he fashioned or ever again crafting its equal. In addition to its fortification qualities, three times per day, Lucifer can cause the fires of Hell to spring forth stationary once called forth). These fires last for 3 rounds and deal 10d6 points of fire damage per round (DC 40 Reflex save for half) and ignore all fire resistance and fire immunity. Only the wearer of the armor is immune to their effects. Those slain by these fires are completely destroyed (including their equipment) and cannot be returned to life through anything short of divine intervention. Hell's Redoubt functions as +1 banded mail and bestows five negative levels for as long as it is worn if worn by anyone other than Lucifer unless the wearer defeats Asmodeus and gains the Throne of Hell. At that point it resumes its ordinary function. Anyone wearing the armor is filled with the overwhelming urge to attempt to do that very thing no matter the cost. The negative levels disappear if the armor is removed.

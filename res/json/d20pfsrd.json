The vampire spawn heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood. Dominate (Su) A vampire spawn can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire spawn targets must succeed on a Will save (DC 14) or fall instantly under the vampire spawn's influence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some vampire spawns might be able to affect different creature types with this power. Energy Drain (Su) A creature hit by a vampire spawn's slam (or other natural weapon) gains one negative level. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a vampire spawn makes. Fast Healing (Su)A vampire spawn also gains fast healing 2. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vampire spawn assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a vampire spawn forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round. Gaseous Form (Su) As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a vampire spawn destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. Shadowless (Ex) A vampire spawn casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror. Spider Climb (Ex)A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider climb spell. Weaknesses Vampire spawns cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire spawn-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire spawn must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire spawn at bay takes a standard action.

Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half)."},{"Name":"Black Jinni","CR":"15.00","XP":"51200","Size":"Large","Init":"10","AC":"30, touch 16, flat-footed 23","HP":"230","Fort":"18","Ref":"18","Will":"10","DefensiveAbilities":"freedom of movement, obscuring cloud","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerability to recitation","Speed":"40 ft., fly 60 ft.

Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid or genie slain by a black jinni's melee attacks enhanced by her shocking touch rises 1d4 rounds later as an undead spawn. Humans rise as zombies, jann rise as ghuls (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 125), and djinn, efreet, shaitans, and marids rise as great ghuls (see page 51). Any spawn created by a black jinni are under her control.  Dust Vortex (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, a black jinni can cause the obscuring cloud that surrounds her to become a vortex of electrically charged dust. This vortex is 20 feet high and radiates to a range of 30 feet, with the black jinni at the vortex's center. The winds within this area are considered a windstorm (Core Rulebook 439). Creatures within the vortex that would normally be blown away are instead drawn toward the center to a square adjacent to the black jinni. A creature that ends its turn within the dust vortex takes 10d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 23 half). Once the dust vortex is created, it remains stationary, allowing the black jinni to move around in it or even leave it. The vortex remains in place for 1d6 rounds, or until the black jinni dismisses it as a move action. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Obscuring Cloud (Ex) A black jinni is continually surrounded by a cloud of obscuring dust and scouring wind. This cloud gives her a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks while within a sandstorm or other area of blowing dust. In addition, a black jinni has concealment (20% miss chance) while the cloud is in effect. Any strong (or stronger) wind can suppress the obscuring cloud as long as the wind persists.  Shocking Touch (Su) Any creature hit by a black jinni's claw attack or its conductive falchion takes an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage-on a critical hit, this additional electricity damage increases to 2d10 points of damage and the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or the electricity lingers on its body, dealing an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage each round on the start of the victim's turn for 1d6 additional rounds. Immersion in any liquid ends this ongoing damage, as does contact with a metal object of at least Medium or larger size that is in contact with the ground. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stormwalk (Ex) A black jinni is able to move about in any storm of natural or unnatural origin of hurricane velocity or less without suffering any of its effects.  Vulnerability to Recitation (Ex) As cursed genies of evil and chaos, black jinn are strangely susceptible to recitations of certain holy tracts belonging to good or lawful deities or philosophies. These include the spells dictum and holy word, but also forceful recitations of nonmagical holy sermonizing. If a cleric or paladin of a lawful or good deity succeeds at an opposed Knowledge (religion) check against a black jinni's Knowledge (religion) check as a standard action, the black jinni must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly destroyed, leaving behind only a small spot of charred ash. If this save is successful, the black jinni instead takes 5d6 points of damage. Unlike most black jinn, though, Agazuberi is particularly patient and accepting of such recitations-she gains a +4 bonus on her Fortitude saves and Knowledge (religion) checks when reacting to this weakness."},{"Name":"Mature Adult Forest Dragon","CR":"15.00","XP":"51200","Size":"Huge","Init":"4","AC":"33, touch 8, flat-footed 33","HP":"256","Fort":"17","Ref":"11","Will":"16","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"26","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft., burrow 20 ft., climb 30 ft., fly 200 ft.

A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus.

A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon).

A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action. Luck (Sp)Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Weakening Breath (Su)Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half)."},{"Name":"Balor Lord","CR":"25.00","XP":"1638400","Size":"Large","Init":"10","AC":"33, touch 17, flat-footed 27","HP":"518","Fort":"31","Ref":"17","Will":"25","DefensiveAbilities":"improved uncanny dodge, trap sense +1","SR":"31","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"50 ft., fly 90 ft.

If successful, the target takes damage equal to the lords's Strength modifier and is moved back as normal. The balor lord does not need to move with the target if successful. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Scent (Ex)The balor lord gains the scent ability while raging and can use this ability to locate unseen foes. Death Throes (Su)When killed, a balor lord explodes in a blinding flash of fire that deals 100 points of damage (half fire, half unholy damage) to anything within 100 feet. A Reflex save DC 35 halve the damage, this DC increases to 37 if the balor lord was killed in rage as the save DC is Constitution-based. Entangle (Ex) If a balor lord strikes a Medium or smaller foe with its whip, the balor can immediately attempt a grapple check without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the balor wins the check, it draws the foe into an adjacent square. The foe gains the grappled condition, but the balor does not. Flaming Body (Su)A balor lord's body is covered in dancing flames. Anyone striking a balor with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a balor or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists.

Vorpal Strike (Su)Any slashing weapon a balor lord wields (including its standard longsword and whip) gains the vorpal weapon quality. Weapons retain this quality for one hour after the balor releases the weapon, but after this the weapon reverts to its standard magical qualities, if any. Whip Mastery (Ex)A balor lord treats a whip as a light weapon for the purposes of two-weapon fighting, and can inflict lethal damage on a foe regardless of the foe's armor."}]

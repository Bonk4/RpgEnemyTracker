A creature engulfed by a living mirage doesn't gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating-but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, the victim is subject to the living mirage's desiccation attack in addition to the damage this ability causes. The save DC to avoid a living mirage's consuming mirage ability is Constitution-based.  Desiccation (Ex) A living mirage siphons streamers of blood and other vital fluids away from living creatures it touches or engulfs. A living creature that takes damage from the living mirage must succeed at a Constitution check to avoid the effects of thirst (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444), using the amount of damage dealt by the living mirage as the check's DC. A creature that is already suffering the effects of thirst must attempt another Constitution check (DC equal to the damage dealt by the living mirage or the DC against thirst as if 1 hour had passed since the target creature's last check, whichever is higher) or take nonlethal damage from their thirst as described in the Core Rulebook. The target takes a cumulative -1 penalty on this check for each consecutive round beyond the first it takes damage from the living mirage. A creature that takes nonlethal damage from thirst as a result of this ability is fatigued.  Gaseous (Ex) A living mirage has a body composed of shimmering air. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects as a result.  Natural Invisibility (Ex) A living mirage remains invisible at all times, even when attacking. This ability isn't subject to the invisibility purge spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint it, a living mirage gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving or a +40 bonus when standing still. These bonuses are not included in the statistics above. Because of its size and pervasiveness within the area it occupies, a living mirage gains only a 20% miss chance due to its invisibility.  Project Mirage (Ex) As a standard action, a living mirage can create an illusory vision in areas of extreme heat or reflection-such as a desert, open ocean, or snow plain-to lure victims toward it. This is a nonmagical mind-affecting glamer effect identical to hallucinatory terrain. The living mirage can dismiss this effect as a swift action. The save DC to disbelieve the illusion is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.  Vulnerable to Wind (Ex) A living mirage is treated as a Small creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it (Core Rulebook 439)."},{"Name":"Pharaonic Guardian","CR":"11.00","XP":"12800","Size":"Large","Init":"7","AC":"25, touch 21, flat-footed 18","HP":"142","Fort":"10","Ref":"12","Will":"12","DefensiveAbilities":"channel resistance +4, incorporeal","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"fly 30 ft.

This effect lasts as long as the guardian wields them and for 1 minute thereafter. The guardian uses these as if its Strength score equaled its Charisma score.  Insightful Strike (Ex) A pharaonic guardian gains a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls against foes whose thoughts it has read via its judging gaze ability.  Judging Gaze (Su) A pharaonic guardian's gaze attack reads the minds of those it sees, as the detect thoughts spell with 3 rounds of concentration. This gaze has a range of 30 feet, and can be negated with a successful DC 22 Will save. This is a mindaffecting divination effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Soul-Rending Wings (Su) As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, a pharaonic guardian can flare its wings to fire rays of soulcutting light in two 30-foot lines extending away from it. Living creatures in the lines gain 1 negative level (Reflex DC 22 negates). A creature whose mind the pharaonic guardian has read from its judging gaze ability takes a -2 penalty on this save. Negative levels from this ability are made permanent at the next sunrise unless the creature succeeds at a DC 22 Fortitude save. The save DCs are Charisma-based."},{"Name":"Hetkoshu","CR":"12.00","XP":"19200","Size":"Gargantuan","Init":"4","AC":"25, touch 6, flat-footed 25","HP":"172","Fort":"16","Ref":"9","Will":"11","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"20 ft., swim 30 ft.","Melee":"bite +23 (3d6+15/19-20 plus grab), tail slap +17 (4d8+7)","Ranged":"","Space":"20 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"death roll (3d6+15 plus trip), fast swallow, savage rush, swallow whole (3d6+15 bludgeoning damage, AC 19, 17 hp)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 40, Dex 10, Con 25, Int 1, Wis 18, Cha 7","BaseAtk":"11","CMB":"30","CMD":"40 (44 vs. trip)","Source":"Osirion, Legacy Of Pharaohs","SpecialAbilities":"Death Roll (Ex) Upon making a successful grapple check against a foe of its size or smaller, a hetkoshu deals bite damage to the target and knocks it prone. This does not break the hetkoshu's grapple.  Hold Breath (Ex) A hetkoshu can hold its breath for 4 rounds per point of Constitution before having to make Constitution checks to continue holding its breath (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445).  Savage Rush (Ex) For 1 round per minute, a hetkoshu may sprint with devastating speed, increasing its land speed to 40 feet and allowing it to treat nonmagical difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain. If it charges during this round, it may attack twice with its bite as its attack action, using the same attack modifier for both attacks."},{"Name":"Sphinx Colossus","CR":"14.00","XP":"38400","Size":"Gargantuan","Init":"5","AC":"31, touch 7, flat-footed 30","HP":"199","Fort":"6","Ref":"9","Will":"10","DefensiveAbilities":"block attacks, fortification (50%)","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., sand glide","Melee":"2 slams +29 (3d6+15) or   stomp +29 (6d6+22 plus pinning stomp)","Ranged":"rock +15 (3d6+15)","Space":"20 ft.","Reach":"20 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"mythic power (4/day, surge +1d8), rock throwing (120 ft.)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 40, Dex 13, Con -, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 13","BaseAtk":"18","CMB":"37","CMD":"48","Source":"Osirion, Legacy Of Pharaohs","SpecialAbilities":"Alternate Form (Ex) As a full-round action, a sphinx colossus can take the form of a sphinx statue.

It can resume its base form as a full-round action.

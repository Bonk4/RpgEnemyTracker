This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes the dweomercat's spell resistance. If it chooses, the dweomercat can immediately make a full attack against the spell's caster as though pouncing. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If there is no safe space adjacent to the caster-or if the dweomercat chooses-the dweomercat can forgo using this ability."},{"Name":"Bearded Devil","CR":"5.00","XP":"1600","Size":"Medium","Init":"6","AC":"19, touch 12, flat-footed 17","HP":"57","Fort":"9","Ref":"7","Will":"3","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"16","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"glaive +11/+6 melee (1d10+6 plus infernal wound) or 2  claws +10 melee (1d6+4)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.

The victim takes 1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or contract devil chills. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Devil Chills: Disease-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Infernal Wound (Su) The damage a bearded devil deals with its glaive inflicts persistent wounds that cause 2 points of bleed damage. Bleed caused from an infernal wound is particularly difficult to stanch-a DC 17 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 16 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects on the victim. The infernal wounds caused by a bearded devil are a supernatural ability of the devil, not of the weapon."},{"Name":"Skrik Nettle","CR":"6.00","XP":"2400","Size":"Large","Init":"7","AC":"20, touch 12, flat-footed 17","HP":"68","Fort":"9","Ref":"11","Will":"3","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"10 ft., fly 30 ft.

Spill Poison (Su) Anytime a skrik nettle is damaged by a slashing or piercing melee weapon, it splashes its poison on the opponent who damaged it.

This effect activates before the dweomercat is affected by the spell targeting it and regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes its spell resistance. Each power lasts for 1 minute per level of the spell targeting the dweomercat, until the dweomercat uses this ability again, or until the dweomercat chooses to dismiss the effect as a free action, whichever duration is shortest. This ability does not prevent the spell affecting the dweomercat from taking effect; it only provides an additional benefit. Abjuration: Gains acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic resistance equal to 2 per spell level. Conjuration: Gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to +1 for every 5 levels of the spell. Divination: Gains the effects of detect chaos, evil, good, or law. Enchantment: Grants the effects of the spell heroism. Evocation: Inflicts an amount of damage equal to the spell's level upon the spell's caster. Illusion: Grants the effects of invisibility. This effect ends as per the spell.

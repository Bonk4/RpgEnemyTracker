Each time a creature takes damage from a verdurous ooze's acid, the creature's metal equipment and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A DC 21 Reflex save prevents damage to such items. A metal or natural weapon that strikes a verdurous ooze takes 1d6 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a verdurous ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 20 points of acid damage (no save) on the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based. Enliven (Sp) The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze cause nearby plants to twitch into life. While in areas covered in natural growth, all squares within 15 feet of the verdurous ooze are affected as if by the spell entangle. The verdurous ooze has no control over this effect, and if dispelled the effect renews after 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Sleep Aura (Su) The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze have a stronger and opposite effect on living, non-plant creatures that come within a 30-foot radius. All living creatures within the area must make a DC 21 Will save or fall asleep for a number of rounds equal to the ooze's HD. Creatures immune to poison are also immune to this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same verdurous ooze's sleep aura for 24 hours. This is a nonmagical sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a verdurous ooze. Instead, if the verdurous ooze would have taken 10 or more points of damage from a single slashing or piercing attack, it splits into two identical oozes, each with half of the original's current hit points (round down). Slashing or piercing attacks that deal less than 10 points of damage do not cause a verdurous ooze to split. Damage from multiple slashing or piercing attacks is not cumulative. A verdurous ooze with 15 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points."},{"Name":"Greater Verduous Ooze","CR":"11.00","XP":"12800","Size":"Large","Init":"-5","AC":"6, touch 4, flat-footed 6","HP":"175","Fort":"13","Ref":"0","Will":"0","DefensiveAbilities":"split","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"slam +17 (1d8+10 plus 1d8 acid and grab)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"acid, constrict (1d8+10 plus 1d8 acid), enliven","AbilitiyScores":"Str 24, Dex 1, Con 26, Int -, Wis 1, Cha 1","BaseAtk":"11","CMB":"+19 (+23 grapple)","CMD":"24 (can't be tripped)","Source":"AP 35","SpecialAbilities":"Acid (Ex): A verdurous ooze secretes a digestive acid that dissolves flesh and metal quickly.

This gastrolith is treated as a thrown splash weapon with a range increment of 30 feet. In addition to damaging any creature struck (as noted above), any creature within 10 feet of the point where the gastrolith strikes (whether a creature or a grid intersection) takes 1d6 points of acid damage. A gastrolith that misses its target hits a nearby point, just like a normal miss with a splash weapon, as detailed on page 202 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. An irlgaunt has a separate orifice for ejecting gastroliths. Thus, it can make a ranged attack in addition to all its normal melee attacks. Stone Step (Ex) An irlgaunt can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while in rocky or subterranean terrain. Magically altered terrain affects an irlgaunt as normal."},{"Name":"First Blade","CR":"15.00","XP":"51200","Size":"Large","Init":"5","AC":"30, touch 10, flat-footed 29","HP":"261","Fort":"20","Ref":"12","Will":"8","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +29 (2d10+16 plus bleed)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"blade slam, bleed (1d10), powerful blows","AbilitiyScores":"Str 32, Dex 13, Con 28, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 13","BaseAtk":"18","CMB":"30","CMD":"41","Source":"AP 35","SpecialAbilities":"Blade Slam (Ex) The First Blade's slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage. Its slams count as natural weapons or manufactured weapons (whichever is most beneficial to it) for the purpose of spells that enhance attacks. Its attacks count as adamantine, chaos, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Breathless (Ex) Unlike most outsiders, the First Blade does not need to breathe. Ever Armed (Su) As a swift action, at will, the First Blade can cause a mundane melee weapon of any type or size to appear in its hands. Although it typically battles unarmed, it sometimes makes use of weapons as needed. These weapons come from Gorum's divine realm, and this ability cannot be used to claim a specific weapon. Heavy Fortification (Ex) The First Blade has a 75% chance to treat a critical hit or sneak attack as a normal attack, as if it were wearing heavy fortification armor. Immunity to Magic (Ex) The First Blade is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. The First Blade can lower this resistance for 1 round as a standard action (similar to a creature with spell resistance lowering its spell resistance) to allow other creatures to cast spells on it; it can use its spell-like abilities on itself without difficulty. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. � A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the First Blade (as the slow spell) for 1 round, with no saving throw. � A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the First Blade and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the First Blade to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The First Blade gets no saving throw against fire effects. � The First Blade is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell. Ironsense (Ex) The First Blade automatically detects iron objects (including steel) within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Lord of Battle (Ex) The First Blade is treated as an 18th-level barbarian and fighter for any game rule (such as a feat prerequisite) that requires levels in barbarian or fighter. It is proficient in all weapons. Powerful Blows (Ex) The First Blade inflicts one and a half times its Strength modifier and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks. Rage Aura (Su) Willing creatures within 100 feet of the First Blade gain the effects of a rage spell automatically, whether they are allies or enemies of the Herald. Those who choose not to be affected are immune to the aura until they leave the area and return (at which point they may again accept or refuse the aura's effect). Swarm Form (Su) The First Blade can shift between its manlike body and a floating swarm of Diminutive and Tiny sharp metal fragments as a standard action. In swarm form it has the swarm subtype; it cannot use its slam attacks but instead can make a swarm attack (4d6 and distraction). Though its individual components may float up to 10 feet above the ground as they move, the Blade's swarm form cannot fly. The First Blade remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the First Blade revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously."}]

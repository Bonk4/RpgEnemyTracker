Steal Magic (Su) As a standard action, a yamah can make a touch attack against a creature under the effect of a spell or spells and attempt to dispel the effect as per the dispel magic spell (CL 6th). If the attempt is successful, the yamah absorbs the magical energy and converts it into a bolt of force. A yamah can use a force bolt to make a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of force damage for every spell level of the effect dispelled by the yamah (for example, if a yamah dispels a 2nd-level spell with its steal magic ability, the resulting force bolt deals 2d6 points of force damage; 0-level spells count as being 1st-level for the purpose of this ability). These force bolts have a range of 100 feet with no range increment. A yamah can only carry a number of force bolts equal to its Charisma bonus (5 for most yamahs), and any force bolts not used within 24 hours of obtaining them disappear and are wasted."},{"Name":"Vydrarch","CR":"14.00","XP":"38400","Size":"Gargantuan","Init":"3","AC":"29, touch 9, flat-footed 26","HP":"199","Fort":"16","Ref":"14","Will":"12","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"20 ft., swim 60 ft.","Melee":"2 bites +26 (2d8+10/19-20 plus grab), tail slap +23 (2d8+5 plus poison spines)","Ranged":"","Space":"20 ft.","Reach":"20 ft.

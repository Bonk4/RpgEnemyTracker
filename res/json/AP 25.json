[{"Name":"Shadowgarm","CR":"2.00","XP":"600","Size":"Medium","Init":"6","AC":"14, touch 12, flat-footed 12","HP":"19","Fort":"3","Ref":"5","Will":"5","DefensiveAbilities":"feather fall, shadow blend","SR":"7","Weaknesses":"light fixation","Speed":"30 ft., climb 30 ft.","Melee":"3 claws +4 (1d4+2 plus shadow slime)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"","AbilitiyScores":"Str 14, Dex 15, Con 14, Int 5, Wis 14, Cha 11","BaseAtk":"2","CMB":"4","CMD":"16","Source":"AP 25","SpecialAbilities":"Feather Fall (Ex) A shadowgarm's body is both light and consists of numerous folds of thin flesh. Although it cannot fly, a falling shadowgarm always descends as if under the effects of a feather fall spell, and thus never takes falling damage. Light Fixation (Su) Although a shadowgarm is not particularly harmed by bright light, it prefers dim lighting. Magical light, on the other hand, causes a shadowgarm to grow slow and lethargic. Whenever a shadowgarm is within an area of bright light that is magically created, it is staggered. Shadow Blend (Su) In conditions of dim light, a shadowgarm's outline wavers and blends with the surrounding shadows, granting it concealment (20% miss chance) even if its opponents are capable of seeing clearly in dim light. Shadow Slime (Su) A shadowgarm is coated with a thin layer of oily black slime. Whenever it strikes a foe, it transfers a swath of this cold black slime onto the creature struck. This slime causes a growing numbness and lethargy in the bodies of those it coats. Each time a creature takes damage from a shadowgarm's claws, the creature struck must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or take a cumulative -2 penalty to its Dexterity score. A creature whose total Dexterity penalty equals its Dexterity score is paralyzed and blinded as long as the penalty remains in effect. All accrued Dexterity penalties fade an hour after the last time the victim was affected by shadow slime, but any new shadow slime resets the recovery period. Exposure to bright light of any sort causes the Dexterity penalty to lessen by 2 points per round until all of the shadow slime is effectively \"burned away\" by the light. A shadowgarm is immune to the effects of its shadow slime and the shadow slime of other shadowgarms. The save DC is Constitution-based."},{"Name":"Ukobach","CR":"4.00","XP":"1200","Size":"Small","Init":"8","AC":"17, touch 15, flat-footed 13","HP":"32","Fort":"2","Ref":"8","Will":"7","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"15","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"1 fire poker +5 (1d6-1 plus 1d4 fire) or 2 claws +5 (1d4- 1 plus 1d4 fire)","Ranged":"1 ember +10 (1d6 fire)","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"animate flames, fire breathing, scorch","AbilitiyScores":"Str 9, Dex 19, Con 13, Int 13, Wis 16, Cha 13","BaseAtk":"5","CMB":"3","CMD":"17","Source":"AP 25","SpecialAbilities":"Animate Flames (Su) As a standard action, an ukobach can animate an existing fire of Small size or larger. Doing so requires an ukobach to make a DC 15 Wisdom check as it impresses its will upon the fire. This DC increases by +5 for every size category of the flame above Small. If an ukobach succeeds, the flame animates with the statistics of a fire elemental of the same size, and follows the ukobach's mental commands. The flames remain animate for a number of rounds equal to the ukobach's Wisdom modifier-usually 3-after which they return to being simple flames, setting the square they cease moving in alight or being extinguished, as their surroundings warrant. Up to five ukobachs can make use of the aid another action to each grant an adjacent ukobach a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check to animate flames (granting a maximum +10 bonus). Fire Leap (Su) As a swift action, an ukobach occupying the same space as a fire, pool of lava, vent of searing steam, or similar blaze can teleport from that burning feature and emerge from another within 100 feet. This ability functions similarly to the spell dimension door, but only between fires. Upon entering a flame, an ukobach is instantly aware of all flames within range through which it might exit. If an ukobach enters a flame and there are no others to exit through within 100 feet, the devil's movement immediately ends and it is stunned for 1 round. Firebreathing (Su) An ukobach can spend a standard action to guzzle a pint of oil, alcohol, or similarly flammable fluid and hold the combustible liquid within its body. At any point within 10 minutes of doing so, the ukobach can expel the liquid either as a 10-foot cone of fire or a 20-foot line of flame, both dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 13 for half). Upon breathing fire an ukobach cannot make use of this ability again until it drinks another pint of oil. The save DC is Constitution-based. Scorch (Su) An ukobach's touch is searing hot, causing its claws and any metal weapon it grasps to deal an additional 1d4 points of fire damage."}]

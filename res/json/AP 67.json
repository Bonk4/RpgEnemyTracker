The resin grants a frost fir a +2 circumstance bonus on all disarm, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers, as well as on saving throws against effects that cause it to drop something it is holding. Any creature that is damaged by a frost fir's slam attack, deals damage to a frost fir with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise touches a frost fir (including with a grapple maneuver), must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be coated with the frost fir's sticky resin. A creature affected by this resin takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and concentration checks (penalties from multiple contacts do not stack). Any enemy grappled by a frost fir takes a -2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape using the Escape Artist skill. Strong alcohol, universal solvent, or any amount of fire damage dealt to a creature coated in resin removes the resin. The save DC is Constitution-based."},{"Name":"Witchcrow","CR":"1.00","XP":"400","Size":"Tiny","Init":"2","AC":"14, touch 14, flat-footed 12","HP":"13","Fort":"2","Ref":"5","Will":"4","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"20 ft., fly 50 ft.

This always entails a raucous aerial ritual, usually centered on those that wish to make use of this ability. The ritual functions like a teleportation circle (CL 17th), except it requires 1 minute of uninterrupted casting time, the circle doesn't need to be placed on a horizontal surface, and it is not invisible or hard to detect. After coming into existence, the edges of the circle glow and the effect stays in place for 1 minute. Most witchcrows loathe using this power, but some offer it as a service to those in need of quick travel, demanding a high price for such assistance-usually something in the bargainer's possession that is cherished, extremely valuable, and almost always magical.  Hexes (Su) A greater witchcrow uses hexes as a 5th-level witch. Invariably, these abilities include the cackle, evil eye, and misfortune hexes, and require a successful DC 15 Will save to negate or resist. Witchcrow cackling proves especially unnerving as it sounds like extremely mocking cawing."},{"Name":"Dvorovoi","CR":"4.00","XP":"1200","Size":"Small","Init":"3","AC":"17, touch 14, flat-footed 14","HP":"38","Fort":"4","Ref":"8","Will":"0","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"15","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"pitchfork +6 (1d8+3)","Ranged":"pitchfork +7 (1d8+3)","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"","AbilitiyScores":"Str 15, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 9, Wis 13, Cha 16","BaseAtk":"3","CMB":"2","CMD":"12 (16 vs. bull rush or trip)","Source":"AP 67","SpecialAbilities":"Oversized Weapons (Ex) A dvorovoi can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty.

Fragrant Haze (Su) As a standard action, a calpina can release magical vapors that cause stupor and vertigo in creatures other than calpinas or their larvae. Each living creature within 20 feet must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be exhausted for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that calpina's fragrant haze for 24 hours.

Creatures that are fatigued or under the effects of see invisibility can see an ikelos, but its nature is partially obscured. An ikelos gains the benefit of partial concealment against such creatures. In addition, its claws deal 3d6 points of damage to such creatures, instead of 2d6. Creatures that are exhausted or under the effects of true seeing can see the ikelos clearly. They suffer no miss chance when striking the ikelos. However, an ikelos's claws deal 4d6 points of damage to such creatures, instead of 2d6.  Fear Dependency (Ex) An ikelos is a creature of nightmares, and it depends completely on fear for its sustenance. An ikelos doesn't recover hit point damage naturally and cannot heal by any means other than its feed on fear ability.  Feed on Fear (Su) Anytime an ikelos is within 15 feet of a dying creature or a creature subject to a fear effect, it gains fast healing 5.  Frightful Gaze (Su) Creatures within 30 feet that meet an ikelos's gaze must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be  paralyzed with fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect and a paralysis effect. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to the frightful gaze of that ikelos for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Lethargy Aura (Su) An ikelos exudes an aura that makes nearby creatures increasingly lethargic. Creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become fatigued. Fatigued creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become exhausted. The effects of the aura end 10 rounds after an affected creature exits the aura. An ikelos can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action. Ikeloses are immune to this ability.

Entering a state of hibernation takes 1 hour, during which the pyropiscis encases itself in a thick layer of igneous stone. While hibernating, a pyropiscis doesn't need to breathe, drink, or eat. The stone casing has hardness 8 and 90 hit points. As long as the casing remains intact, the pyropiscis within remains unharmed. The pyropiscis remains in a state of hibernation until it senses lava (or another source of extreme heat) nearby, at which point it breaks out of its case over the course of 1d4 minutes.  Lava Bomb (Ex) Like an active volcano, a pyropiscis can spit a lava bomb-a blob of molten rock-as a ranged attack (range increment 30 feet). If a lava bomb hits, it deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage to its target.  Lava Dependency (Ex) A pyropiscis can breathe indefinitely while submerged in lava. It can survive out of lava for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this limit, the pyropiscis runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were drowning.  Searing Bite (Ex) A pyropiscis's searing-hot jaws are designed to bind readily to flesh, giving it a firm grasp on its prey. This functions as the constrict ability, except that a pyropiscis deals 2d6 points of fire damage when it makes a successful grapple check, rather than dealing bludgeoning damage.  Sprint (Ex) Once per minute, a pyropiscis may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40 feet for 1 round."},{"Name":"Magnetite Golem","CR":"10.00","XP":"9600","Size":"Large","Init":"-1","AC":"24, touch 8, flat-footed 24","HP":"101","Fort":"4","Ref":"3","Will":"5","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"20 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +20 (2d10+8 plus inescapable grip and  magnetic disarm)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"inescapable grip, magnetic disarm","AbilitiyScores":"Str 27, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 12, Cha 1","BaseAtk":"13","CMB":"+22 (+26 grapple)","CMD":"31","Source":"AP 95","SpecialAbilities":"Immunity to Magic (Ex) A magnetite golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  � Any spell that deals fire damage instead disables a magnetite golem's inescapable grip, magnetic disarm, and magnetic field for 1d4 rounds, with no saving throw.  � A magical attack that deals electricity damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A magnetite golem receives no saving throw against electricity effects.  Inescapable Grip (Ex) Whenever a magnetite golem hits a metallic creature or a creature wearing metal armor with its slam attack, it attempts to grapple the creature as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If a magnetite golem successfully grapples such a creature, it partially adheres to the golem's body, and the golem needs only one arm to maintain the grapple. In these instances, a magnetite golem may still make a single slam attack on its turn with its remaining arm.  Magnetic Disarm (Su) Whenever a magnetite golem hits a creature wielding a metal weapon with its slam attack, it attempts to disarm the weapon as a free action that doesn't  provoke attacks of opportunity. If the golem successfully disarms a metal weapon, the weapon sticks to the golem's magnetic body rather than dropping to the ground. The golem is considered to have possession of the weapon, and the weapon must be retrieved using a disarm combat maneuver.  Magnetic Field (Su) A magnetite golem is surrounded by a magnetic field, which pulls all metallic creatures and objects toward it. At the start of a magnetite golem's turn, as a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, the golem attempts a combat maneuver check against every creature within 30 feet that is connected to a piece of metal. Affected creatures include (but are not limited to) metallic creatures, creatures wearing metal armor, and creatures wielding metal weapons. If the golem succeeds at its combat maneuver against a creature, the affected creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the golem, and can't move away from the golem during its next round. The magnetic field is stronger than gravity, and can pull creatures off the ground. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Large or smaller metal objects automatically travel toward magnetite golem at a rate of 10 feet per round. This magnetism is supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects."},{"Name":"Iron Rhinoceros","CR":"11.00","XP":"12800","Size":"Huge","Init":"1","AC":"25, touch 9, flat-footed 24","HP":"131","Fort":"6","Ref":"7","Will":"4","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"gore +21 (3d8+9/19-20), 2 chains +19 (2d6+4 plus grab)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.

It doesn't gain the grappled condition when using its chains to grapple enemies, and can maintain a grapple using its chains as a free action, though doing so prevents it from attacking with that chain. An iron rhinoceros may have up to two creatures grappled in its chains at a time. Additionally, the chains seek to ensnare creatures the rhino tramples. The chains entangle any creature that fails its saving throw against the rhinoceros's trample attack, or that chooses to forgo its save in order to make an attack of opportunity against the rhinoceros. An entangled creature can escape from the chains as a standard action by succeeding on a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each chain has AC 12, hardness 10, and 15 hit points. Creatures entangled in the chains can't move farther than 20 feet away from the rhinoceros. If the rhinoceros moves farther than 20 feet from an entangled target, the tethering chain breaks, but the target remains entangled.  Powerful Drag (Ex) An iron rhinoceros can use the dragAPG combat maneuver to savagely scrape its foes across the ground. As a full-round action, an iron rhinoceros can attempt a single drag combat maneuver against every creature currently tethered to its grasping chains. This deals 1d6 points of damage for every 5 feet dragged, and the chains tethered to any creature more than 20 feet away break. The dragging damage may increase depending on the terrain, at the GM's discretion. Creatures dragged any distance are knocked prone.  Scooping Charge (Ex) An iron rhinoceros can unhinge its snout in order to scoop enemies into the furnace-like cavity within its belly. When making a powerful charge, the iron rhinoceros can forgo dealing damage in order to gain the grab and fast swallow abilities with its gore attack. The rhinoceros must make this choice at the beginning of its charge.  Swallow Whole (Ex) An iron rhinoceros's belly functions as a furnace, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to swallowed creatures. Hatches on the rhinoceros's sides allow it to swallow creatures grappled in its chains. In order to take swallowed creatures prisoner without dealing fire damage, the rhinoceros can suppress (or activate) the flames within its furnace as a swift action. When the rhinoceros is suppressing the flames, the furnace instead fills with smoke, forcing swallowed creatures to succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save each round or be sickened for as long as they remain in the rhinoceros's belly. This save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures attempting to cut their way out of the iron rhinoceros's belly must overcome the durability of the thick furnace walls (hardness 10)."}]

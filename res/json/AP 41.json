This acts as a suggestion spell, but the umdhlebi can only compel this one action. A creature that makes a DC 20 Will save is unaffected, and is immune to the same umdhlebi's compelling whisper for 24 hours. An umdhlebi can also use this ability on creatures it is grappling, increasing the DC to 25. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Treacherous Ground (Ex) The mass of gnashing roots and stems at the base of an umdhlebi's trunk are constantly in motion. As a result, all squares within 5 feet of the umdhlebi's space are treated as difficult terrain for the purposes of movement through the area.  Writhing Tendrils (Ex) All umdhlebis have eight tendrils, but the creature can only make 2 slam attacks in a single round.  However, an umdhlebi can continue to make 2 slam attacks even while its other tendrils are grappling or constricting.  An umdhlebi can use this ability as long as it has two or more tendrils free to attack."},{"Name":"Inkanyamba","CR":"13.00","XP":"25600","Size":"Gargantuan","Init":"7","AC":"28, touch 10, flat-footed 24","HP":"178","Fort":"15","Ref":"15","Will":"10","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"60 ft., swim 60 ft.","Melee":"bite +25 (4d8+12 plus grab and poison), tail slap +20  (3d8+6)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"breath weapon, constrict (4d8+12), hypnotic sway, protean venom","AbilitiyScores":"Str 34, Dex 17, Con 20, Int 13, Wis 17, Cha 20","BaseAtk":"17","CMB":"+33(+37)","CMD":"47","Source":"AP 41","SpecialAbilities":"Breath Weapon (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, an inkanyamba can spit a 60-foot line of venom at its foes as a standard action. Any creatures struck must make a DC 23 Reflex save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and be blinded for 1d6 rounds. A successful save halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1 point) and negates the blindness.  Hold Breath (Ex) An inkanyamba can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning or suffocating.  Hypnotic Sway (Su) As a full-round action, an inkanyamba can unfurl its hood and sway back and forth. Any nonmindless creature within 30 feet that views an inkanyamba's hypnotic sway must make a DC 23 Will save or be fascinated for 1d4 rounds. Any attack by the inkanyamba breaks the fascination effect. Any creature that successfully saves or has the fascination effect broken cannot be affected by the same inkanyamba's hypnotic sway for 24 hours.  Poison (Ex) An inkanyamba's body contains a host of different venoms. Once per round as a swift action, it can change which ability score its poison affects.  Vacillating Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds, effect 1d4 ability damage, cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Venomsense (Ex) An inkanyamba that makes physical contact with a living creature through either its bite, tail slap, or constriction ability gains an automatic knowledge of the target's ability scores, allowing the inkanyamba to better use its protean venom on its victims."},{"Name":"Arcanotheign","CR":"15.00","XP":"51200","Size":"Medium","Init":"12","AC":"27, touch 27, flat-footed 18","HP":"207","Fort":"19","Ref":"14","Will":"18","DefensiveAbilities":"incorporeal, adaptive life force","SR":"31","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft., fly 60 ft.

Though she is a living creature (for the purpose of harmless spells such as deathwatch and detect undead), she counts as either a living creature or an undead creature, depending on which outcome is more favorable to her (for example, rendering her immune to both circle of death and undeath to death). Alter Objects (Su) At will, the Arcanotheign can transmute nonliving objects into different shapes (as fabricate), transform solid materials into other materials (such as wood into stone or stone into metal), or imbue physical objects with temporary life (as animate objects). These transformations last 1 minute before reverting to their previous state, though the herald can extend this duration as long as she concentrates and remains within 1,000 feet of the transformed object. When animating objects, she prefers to create lifelike animals out of earth, stone, or wood, and can sustain up to four Large creatures at a time (treat as normal animals, except the animal's natural armor increases by +5, its type changes to \"construct,\" and it gains construct immunities). The Arcanotheign must be within 100 feet of the object to use this ability, and can only maintain one type of transformation (alter shape, alter material, or animate objects) at a time. Corporeal Form (Ex) As an immediate action, the Arcanotheign can take physical form, losing her incorporeal special quality and subtype and her deflection bonus to AC, but gaining a Strength score of 20 and a natural armor bonus equal to her normal deflection bonus. She can remain in this form indefinitely or revert to her incorporeal state as a free action (this happens automatically if she is knocked unconscious). This ability allows her to pretend to be a mortal and physically manipulate objects. In this form she looks like a tall woman with pale, gray, or black skin. Eldritch Blast (Su) The Arcanotheign's ranged touch attacks are incorporeal touch attacks that deal 4d6 points of damage and an additional effect chosen by the herald. A saving throw (DC 25) negates the additional effect (the exact type of save depends on what effect the herald chooses); a creature hit by two blasts in the same round suffers an increased effect if it fails both its saves against the eldritch blasts. The possible effects are the following: Bleed (Fortitude): The creature takes 10 points of bleed damage. Increased effect: The creature is disintegrated. Dement (Will): The creature is confused for 1 minute. Increased effect: The creature goes insane (as insanity). Displace (Fortitude): The creature teleports (as dimension door) 5 feet in a random horizontal direction at the end of its turn each round for the next 10 rounds. Increased effect: The creature is banished as if under the effect of a maze spell. Ignite (Reflex): The creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Increased effect: The creature catches on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage every round on the herald's turn for the next 10 rounds. The DC to extinguish the flames is equal to the save DC of the eldritch blast. Paralyze (Will): The creature is paralyzed as if by hold monster. Increased effect: The creature is slowed (as slow) when the paralysis ends or is broken. Energy Channel Aura (Su) The Arcanotheign's aura is charged with energy, whether acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative, or positive. The herald can change the energy type, suppress her aura, or reactivate her aura once per round on her turn as a free action. If the energy is positive or negative, it acts like channeled energy from a cleric, and the herald decides the effect of the channel (positive energy could heal living creatures or harm undead; negative energy could heal undead or harm living creatures). The aura's effect is always 2d6 hit points (Reflex DC 25 negates). A creature that is struck by the herald's incorporeal touch attack takes this damage in addition to the normal touch attack damage, and it gets no saving throw against this extra damage. The herald can use her Selective Channel feat to exclude creatures from the effect of her aura, regardless of the aura's energy type. Resistance to Divine Power (Su) The Arcanotheign has resistance 30 against damage caused by divine power, such as the non-fire damage from a flame strike spell."}]

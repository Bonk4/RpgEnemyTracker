The save DC is Constitution-based.  Stagnation Aura (Su) A blightspawn's stagnation aura causes lethargy and torpor in those who approach it, sapping energy and speed. When a creature comes within 20 feet of a blightspawn, it must make a DC 16 Will save to avoid being affected as per the spell slow, for as long as the creature remains within the blightspawn's aura and for an additional 1d3 rounds after leaving it. Once a creature successfully saves against the aura, it is immune to that particular blightspawn's aura for 24 hours; otherwise, re-entering the aura forces a creature to save again. In addition, this aura fouls liquids of all types within the area. A creature that drinks anything in a blightspawn's aura (including potions and alchemical elixirs) must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based."}]

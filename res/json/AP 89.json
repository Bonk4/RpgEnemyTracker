These spikes impale nearby creatures, dealing 6d6 points of piercing damage to each creature adjacent to the gammenore (Reflex DC 19 half). Additionally, the spikes shatter easily, embedding shards of ice in the flesh of creatures that fail their saving throws against the attack-these shards deal 1d6 points of bleed damage each round until the wounds are healed. A gammenore can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Oversized Pincer (Ex) A gammenore's pincer attack is a primary attack that deals the indicated amount of damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier.  Shell of Ice (Su) Much of a gammenore's carapace is encased in a thick layer of jagged icicles. This shell of ice functions much like spiked armor, dealing 1d8 points of piercing damage to the target of any successful grapple combat maneuver check made by the gammenore.  Additionally, this frozen shell helps to regulate the gammenore's cold body temperature, granting it resistance 10 to fire. The shell can absorb up to 60 points of fire damage before melting. Once the shell melts, the gammenore takes a -4 penalty to its natural armor bonus, it loses its fire resistance, and it deals no additional damage when grappling. A gammenore can reconstitute a melted shell by spending time in areas of intense cold. This process takes 2 hours in a cold environment, 3d10 minutes in areas of severe cold, and 1d10 minutes in areas of extreme cold."},{"Name":"Surgeon Robot","CR":"14.00","XP":"38400","Size":"Medium","Init":"11","AC":"27, touch 17, flat-footed 20","HP":"254","Fort":"6","Ref":"13","Will":"7","DefensiveAbilities":"hardness 10","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerable to critical hits and electricity","Speed":"30 ft., fly 60 ft.

All damage dealt to a surgeon robot with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the surgeon robot is immune to critical hits. A surgeon robot's force field has fast healing 15, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate for 24 hours.  Master Surgeon (Ex) Programmed to execute advanced medical procedures, a surgeon robot can perform surgeries and other procedures that heal humanoid creatures of all manner of maladies. A surgeon robot can heal wounds, set broken bones, cure diseases, treat burns, remove poison, and even install cybertech items. These procedures take varying amounts of time for the surgeon robot to complete and require different Heal check DCs. The DCs for these surgical procedures increase by 10 when they're performed on a non-humanoid creature. These procedures leave the patient with the exhausted condition. If the surgeon robot fails any of its Heal checks, the surgery fails and the patient takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and is exhausted for 24 hours. The procedures a surgeon robot can perform are as follows:  � Cure Blindness/Deafness (DC 35): The patient's sight or hearing is restored. Required Time: 30 minutes.  � Install Cybertech (DC = 5 + the cybertech install DC): Cybernetic equipment is installed safely. Required Time: 20 minutes per point of implantation of the cybertech being installed.  � Minor Surgery (DC 25): The patient is healed of 1d8+1 points of damage. Required Time: 5 minutes.  � Moderate Surgery (DC 30): The patient is healed of 2d8+3 points of damage and 1d4+1 points of ability damage to a selected ability score. Required Time: 10 minutes.  � Major Surgery (DC 35): The patient is healed of 3d8+5 points of damage and is cured of blindness and deafness. Required Time: 15 minutes.  � Critical Surgery (DC 40): The patient is healed of 4d8+7 points of damage and either all ability damage to all ability scores or all ability drain to one ability score. Required Time: 30 minutes.  � Treat Toxin (DC = 10 + the save DC of disease or poison): One disease or poison currently afflicting the patient is removed. Required Time: 10 minutes.  Specialized Programming (Ex) Heal is always a class skill for surgeon robots, and they gain a +8 racial bonus on Heal checks.  Superior Optics (Ex) Surgeon robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.  Syringe (Ex) When a surgeon robot makes a successful attack with its syringe, it can inject the target with pharmaceuticals. The robot contains nanites that fabricate the pharmaceuticals stored within its body. Up to 10 doses of these pharmaceuticals can be administered per day. The surgeon robot can choose to affect its target with cardioamp, cureall, hemochem (grade III), torpinal, or zortaphen each time it uses this ability. Rules for these pharmaceuticals can be found on pages 33-34 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide."},{"Name":"Gravedragger","CR":"15.00","XP":"51200","Size":"Large","Init":"8","AC":"29, touch 17, flat-footed 25","HP":"195","Fort":"15","Ref":"18","Will":"17","DefensiveAbilities":"unearthly luck","SR":"26","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"50 ft., fly 30 ft.

Gravedragger must be  adjacent to the grave he intends to drag his target into. Treat this as a special drag combat maneuver. The target takes 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half) and is buried alive (see Cave-Ins and Collapses on page 415 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Long Arm of the Reaper (Ex) Gravedragger can throw his heavy pick up to 100 feet away as a ranged attack with no range increment. The weapon automatically returns just before the herald's next turn, as if it had the returning weapon quality.  Unearthly Luck (Su) Gravedragger adds his Charisma bonus as a luck bonus on all his saving throws and to his Armor Class.  Unluck Aura (Su) Gravedragger radiates an aura of unluck to a radius of 30 feet. Any creature in this area must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results. This is a mind-affecting effect that doesn't work on worshipers of Zyphus. Any creature that gains any sort of luck bonus (such as that granted by a luckstone or divine favor) is immune to Gravedragger's unluck aura."},{"Name":"Juggernaut Robot","CR":"15.00","XP":"51200","Size":"Gargantuan","Init":"0","AC":"26, touch 6, flat-footed 26","HP":"245","Fort":"6","Ref":"6","Will":"7","DefensiveAbilities":"hardness 10","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerable to critical hits and electricity","Speed":"50 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +29 (2d6+13/19-20 plus 1d6 electricity)","Ranged":"2 integrated heavy laser rifles +16 touch (4d10 fire)","Space":"20 ft.","Reach":"20 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"atomizer, charge fist, combined arms, electromagnetic pulse, vicious trample (6d6+19, DC 33)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 36, Dex 11, Con -, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 1","BaseAtk":"20","CMB":"+37 (+41 bull rush, +39 sunder)","CMD":"47 (49 vs. bull rush, 49 vs. sunder)","Source":"AP 89","SpecialAbilities":"Atomizer (Ex) As a full-round action once every 3 rounds, a juggernaut robot can fire a ray from its eye as a ranged touch attack. On a hit, the ray deals 15d6 points of damage. When used against an object, the atomizer disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. A creature or object that succeeds at a DC 21 Fortitude save instead takes only 5d6 points of damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this attack is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. The save DC is Intelligence-based.  Charge Fist (Ex) A juggernaut robot can charge its oversized fists with electricity as a free action, causing its slam attacks to deal 1d6 points of electricity damage. On a critical hit, a charged strike explodes with electric energy, dealing an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage. This electricity doesn't harm the juggernaut.  Combined Arms (Ex) When taking a full-attack action, a juggernaut robot can attack with its melee and ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.  Electromagnetic Pulse (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a juggernaut robot can unleash an electromagnetic pulse in a 20- foot radius that bypasses any active force fields (or similar effects) and deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to any robots or creatures with cybernetic implants. This effect doesn't harm the juggernaut robot itself or other living creatures. Creatures affected by this attack that succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save take only half the normal amount of damage. Any technological item within this radius is drained of 1d6 charges unless the item succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.  Force Field (Ex) A juggernaut robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants it 75 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a juggernaut with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the juggernaut is immune to critical hits. A juggernaut's force field has fast healing 10, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  Integrated Heavy Lasers (Ex) A juggernaut robot has a heavy laser rifle built into each of its arms. Each weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 4d10 points of fire damage. Each can fire once per round in a burst of shots that attacks all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll against each creature in the line, and each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage can't be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately.  Targeting Array (Ex) Juggernaut robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible. In addition, because of their complex array of sensors, juggernauts suffer no miss chance if a target has concealment, and reduce the miss chance from total concealment to 20%.  Vicious Trample (Ex) A juggernaut robot's massive steel feet deal 6d6+19 points of damage on a successful trample attack."}]

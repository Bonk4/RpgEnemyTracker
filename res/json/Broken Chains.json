This penalty remains until the affected creature takes any amount of magical healing or is healed with a successful DC 20 Heal check. The save DC is Strength-based.  Hallucinatory Aura (Su) Any creature coming within 20 feet of a yaenit must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or succumb to the demon's foul, mind-warping magic. A creature affected by a yaenit's hallucinatory aura takes a -2 penalty on Will saves, caster level checks, Intelligence-based skill checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks for as long as it remains within the aura's range and 1d4-1 rounds after leaving the area of effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save was successful, an affected creature is immune to the same yaenit's hallucinatory aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based."}]

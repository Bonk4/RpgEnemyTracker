It does not provoke attacks of opportunity with its flechette spray attacks when using combined arms.  Expert Climber (Ex) An ugothokra's feet allow it to climb any surface, no matter how slick or sheer. In effect, an ugothokra is treated as constantly being under the effects of spider climb, though this is effect is natural rather than magical.  Flechette Spray (Ex) An ugothokra can fire bursts of calcified bone and horn from the vents along its abdomen. All six vents can fire as part of a full-attack action, or it can fire one vent as a standard action. This attack has a range increment of 50 feet. An ugothokra generates the \"ammunition\" it uses for this attack internally by feeding on organic material, and effectively has an unlimited supply of flechette material at any one time, but an ugothokra that is currently starving can't use this attack until at least 1 hour after feeding.  Infected Blood (Ex) A creature that damages an ugothokra with a slashing or piercing melee weapon (regardless of how often the ugothokra is damaged) must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw at the end of its turn or be sprayed by the ugothokra's infected blood. A creature that damages an ugothokra with a slashing or piercing natural weapon automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature is exposed to a random viral infection (see below), but gains a +4 bonus on the Fortitude save to resist contracting whatever disease it is exposed to. Unlike when a victim contracts an infection from an ugothokra's flechette spray, diseases caught via contact with the monster's blood have normal onset times as determined by the disease in question. The Reflex save is Dexterity-based.  Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con plus sickened for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Viral Infection (Su) An ugothokra's body is infested with numerous potent and highly infectious diseases engineered by their Dominion creators to cause highly specific conditions in those they infect. An ugothokra's blood carries these diseases, and while the creature can transmit random infections by means of contact with its blood, the most efficient method of transmission is via its flechette spray. Most ugothokras carry the following three contagions in their systems, and they can decide which one to inflict on a target as part of the act of firing a flechette spray-it can even inflict different diseases with different sprays in the same round if it so chooses. Some ugothokras carry additional viral infections that are tailored by their Dominion creators for incredibly specialized tasks. A creature exposed to any of these viral infections can resist the infection with a successful DC 19 Fortitude save, but on a failed save, the effect occurs immediately and the onset time is ignored. Contracting an infection via the ugothokra's blood is not as efficient and uses the listed onset time. The most common viral infections available to an ugothokra are listed below.  Aklo Submission: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Wisdom drain (can't drain Wisdom below 0) plus susceptibility to Aklo; cure 2 consecutive saves. As long as a creature is infected with this disease (even if the creature isn't currently suffering any Wisdom drain from the disease), it becomes unusually compliant and responsive to commands issued to it in Aklo. Any Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check attempted against the character while speaking in Aklo gains a +4 bonus. Furthermore, as a full-round action, any creature can issue a command to the victim in Aklo to attempt to affect the victim with a suggestion effect (effective CL 5th, regardless of the commander's level)-the victim can resist this suggestion with a successful DC 14 Will save. Once a victim of Aklo submission succeeds at a Will save to resist such a suggestion, it can't be further affected in this way by any Aklo-speaking creature for 24 hours.  Flesh Ripen Fever: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage plus stench; cure 2 consecutive saves. A character suffering from flesh ripen fever exudes a nauseating stench as his skin decays and sloughs off, leaving behind reeking pits of stinking flesh. The victim is automatically sickened by its own smell, as are all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save allows a creature to ignore the sickening effect for 24 hours-the victim of flesh ripen fever doesn't get such a saving throw to avoid being sickened. This stench is a poison effect that doesn't affect creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black.  Implant Rejection Syndrome: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con drain plus 1d2 Int drain plus implant rejection; cure 2 consecutive saves. This insidious sickness is particularly devastating to creatures with cybernetic implants. Such creatures take a -2 penalty on all saving throws attempted to resist this disease. Further, each time a saving throw to resist its effect is attempted and failed, the creature takes 2d6 points of damage and loses the use of one randomly selected cybernetic implant for 24 hours."},{"Name":"Reclamation Robot","CR":"12.00","XP":"19200","Size":"Large","Init":"11","AC":"27, touch 16, flat-footed 20","HP":"168","Fort":"7","Ref":"12","Will":"7","DefensiveAbilities":"hardness 10","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerable to critical hits and electricity","Speed":"30 ft., climb 20 ft.","Melee":"5 claws +21 (1d6+6/19-20 plus grab)","Ranged":"integrated laser rifle +22 touch (2d6 fire)","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"combined arms, constrict (1d6+6), efficient grappler","AbilitiyScores":"Str 22, Dex 25, Con -, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 1","BaseAtk":"16","CMB":"+23 (+31 grapple, +27 sunder)","CMD":"40 (48 vs. grapple, 42 vs. sunder, 44 vs. trip)","Source":"AP 88","SpecialAbilities":"Combined Arms (Ex) When taking a full-attack action, a reclamation robot can attack with its claws and its integrated laser rifle simultaneously. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity with its integrated laser rifle when using combined arms.  Efficient Grappler (Ex) A reclamation robot takes only a -10 penalty on its combat maneuver check to make and maintain a grapple on a foe when using only its claw rather than its whole body to grapple. It receives a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks to start and maintain a grapple rather than the normal +4 bonus granted by the grab ability. A reclamation robot can make an attack with its integrated laser rifle against one creature it is grappling as a swift action-when it attacks in this way, the robot has a threat range of 18-20 for critical hits with the laser rifle.  Item Creation (Ex) Reclamation robots are known for their startling creativity in repairing damaged technology. A reclamation robot ignores all of the item creation feat requirements for creating a technological item, but must have access to a sufficient amount of scrap metal and spare parts in order to create or repair an item (the robot must still expend materials equal to the item's cost). A reclamation robot can attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to restore a timeworn technological item to full functionality-the DC of this check is equal to the item's Craft DC + 5, and requires an expenditure of technological components worth a total amount of money equal to the timeworn item's cost (half the cost of the object in its pristine condition). Failure results in the destruction of the item. When a reclamation robot restores a technological  item to full functionality in this manner, if the robot exceeds its DC by a result of 10 or more, it improves the item in some way-choose one of the following improvements or determine one randomly.  � The item's capacity permanently increases by 50%.  � If the item is a weapon or armor, it becomes masterwork.  � The item becomes hardened (increase its hardness by 2).  � The item becomes fortified (increase its hit points by 50%).  � The item becomes lightweight (weight is divided in half).  Force Field (Ex) A reclamation robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants it 50 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a reclamation robot with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the reclamation robot is immune to critical hits. A reclamation robot's force field has fast healing 10, but once these hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.  Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex) A reclamation robot has a built-in laser rifle in its chest. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 2d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through force fields and force effects, such as a wall of force, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment.  Salvage (Ex) A reclamation robot is designed specifically to salvage technology for further use. All Craft skills are class skills for reclamation robots, and they gain a +4 racial bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks and gain Technologist as a bonus feat. A reclamation robot can repair 2d6 points of damage to a robot within reach (including itself) as a standard action.  Scaling (Ex) Reclamation robots are expected to work at great heights or while clinging to immense ships. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Climb checks. Once every 1d4 rounds, a reclamation robot can increase its climb speed to 40 feet as a swift action for 1 round.  Vulnerable to Critical Hits (Ex) Like all robots, reclamation robots are vulnerable to critical hits. In addition, when a critical hit is confirmed against a reclamation robot, roll a d8. On a roll of 1, instead of suffering additional damage from the critical hit, the robot suffers damage to essential processing units and memory modules that it cannot itself repair (although another reclamation robot could repair this damage). While such damage is not readily apparent on the exterior-and the robot itself is essentially  unaware of it-this kind of injury can have a number of different effects. When such an injury occurs, roll d% and consult the following chart to determine the nature of the damage.  d% Result  01-20 The robot takes a -4 penalty on all skill checks.  21-30 The robot's integrated laser rifle now glitches each time it is fired as if it were timewornTG.  31-40 The robot loses its scaling ability (including its bonus on Climb checks).  41-60 When it attempts to repair damage to a robot via salvage, it only repairs 1d4 points of damage.  61-70 Movement is reduced by 10 feet.  71-95 One of the robot's claw attacks becomes nonfunctional.  96-100 The robot goes berserk, functioning as if under the simultaneous effects of a confusion spell and a rage spell."},{"Name":"Shipmind","CR":"13.00","XP":"25600","Size":"Huge","Init":"13","AC":"27, touch 17, flat-footed 18","HP":"161","Fort":"11","Ref":"13","Will":"12","DefensiveAbilities":"amorphous, thought disruption","SR":"24","Weaknesses":"limited mobility, vulnerable to cold","Speed":"0 ft. or 10 ft.

This container functions somewhat like a suit of armor for the shipmind. A shipmind container has hardness 10 and 240 hit points, and can be damaged by sunder attempts. A shipmind container that gains the broken quality grants only a +5 armor bonus to the  shipmind within, and does not allow the shipmind to heal negative levels gained during a prolonged period outside of the container (see Limited Mobility). The partially crystalline nature of a shipmind container makes it vulnerable to shatter spells, and sonic damage bypasses the container's hardness and inflicts full damage.  Immerse (Ex) When a shipmind in its container successfully grabs a Large or smaller target with one of its slam attacks, it can attempt to drag that target into its body as a swift action. To immerse a creature, the shipmind must attempt a combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, the prey is pulled into the container with the shipmind and immediately takes 6d6 points of plasma damage (half of which is electricity and half of which is fire) and 1d4 points of Intelligence damage-a successful DC 24 Fortitude save halves the plasma damage and negates the Intelligence damage. A creature that remains immersed takes this damage again every following round at the start of the shipmind's turn. In addition, an immersed creature is in danger of suffocating. A creature can attempt to escape immersion by making a successful combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, as if it were attempting to escape a pin. If the shipmind's container has the broken condition, attempts to escape in this manner gain a +8 bonus.  Limited Mobility (Ex) Unlike most oozes, a shipmind cannot exist outside of the partially organic container it was originally created in-this container serves the shipmind as its \"skin.\" While inside its container, a shipmind has a speed of 0 feet. When it leaves its container, it gains a speed of 10 feet, but loses its armor bonus to AC. A shipmind can exist outside of its container for 1 hour without consequences, but at the start of each subsequent hour it gains 1 negative level as its body starts to dissolve. These negative levels cannot be restored by any means save by returning to an appropriate shipmind container, at which point they are removed at a rate of 1 level per hour.  Plasma Bolt (Su) As a standard action, a shipmind can fire a bolt of plasma at a target within 300 feet (no range increment). On a hit, a blast of plasma deals 10d6 damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.  Ship Interface (Ex) As long as a shipmind is interfaced with a Dominion vessel, it can observe events within the ship or within 90 feet of its exterior hull as if via clairaudience/ clairvoyance for as long as the shipmind concentrates. While concentrating on an area, the shipmind can activate traps or other ship systems in the area as a swift action; it can even converse with creatures in the area by vibrating the metal and strange membranes in the walls.  Thought Disruption (Su) The substance that makes up a shipmind ooze is charged with alien psychic energy that is toxic to the minds of most life forms. A creature who  willfully touches an ooze (via a touch attack, natural weapon attack, or unarmed strike) or is struck by its slam attack must make a DC 22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based."},{"Name":"Yah-Thelgaad","CR":"14.00","XP":"38400","Size":"Large","Init":"8","AC":"30, touch 25, flat-footed 26","HP":"200","Fort":"13","Ref":"11","Will":"17","DefensiveAbilities":"carapace","SR":"25","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"20 ft., fly 40 ft.

Each stored brain grants a yah-thelgaad a cumulative +2 insight bonus to AC, concentration checks, and Knowledge checks. A yah-thelgaad can extract a brain from a helpless opponent with a coup de grace attack, or as a standard action from a body that has been dead for no more than 1 minute. A yah-thelgaad that has fewer than six collected brains gains two negative levels for each missing brain. These negative levels never become permanent, and can only be removed by replacing one of the yah-thelgaad's collected brains. The statistics presented here assume a yah-thelgaad with a full collection.  Carapace (Ex) The spikes on a yah-thelgaad's carapace make melee attacks against it hazardous. Any opponent attempting to attack a yah-thelgaad with a light weapon, unarmed strike, touch attack, or natural attack must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of bleed damage from these bristling barbs. Bleed damage from multiple failed Reflex saves does not stack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Command Disease (Su) As a swift action, a yah-thelgaad can cause a disease or infection currently afflicting a creature within 30 feet to quicken and activate, forcing the afflicted creature to immediately attempt a saving throw against the disease's effects. Those who fail immediately suffer the disease's effects. These additional saving throws count against those one must succeed at to recover from a disease, so it's possible for a victim to be cured by succeeding at enough saving throws. Any creature that has been affected by a yah-thelgaad's command disease ability (whether or not the creature succeeded at the saving throw this ability triggered) takes a -2 penalty against any mind-affecting spell or effect generated by the yah-thelgaad in the next minute.  Mind Storm (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a yah-thelgaad can employ its own brain as well as any brains kept in its blisters to create a powerful psychic vortex. When the creature activates this ability, all creatures within a 40-foot radius must succeed at DC 23 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. When a yah-thelgaad activates this ability, it can choose to absorb one of its brains as a swift action to cause one creature within the area of effect that has succumbed to the confusion  effect to instead become stunned for 1d4 rounds. A creature stunned in this manner is confused for 1d4 rounds after the stun effect ends. A yah-thelgaad generally saves this tactic for when it's faced with a particularly dangerous foe, since the stun effect forces the yah-thelgaad to lose one of its stored brains and gain 2 negative levels. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Claw-injury; save Fort DC 26; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Strength damage and nauseated for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Powerful Tentacles (Ex) A yah-thelgaad's tentacles are primary attacks.  Spells (Su) A yah-thelgaad casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. Its caster level is reduced by 2 for each negative level it gains from missing brains. A yah-thelgaad with no collected brains can't cast any of its spells.  Spellstrike (Su) Whenever a yah-thelgaad casts a spell with a range of \"touch,\" it can deliver the spell through its claw attack as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, the yah-thelgaad can make one free melee attack with its claw as part of casting the spell. If successful, this claw attack deals its normal damage (including poison) as well as the effects of the spell.  Strange Knowledge (Ex) All knowledge skills are class skills for yah-thelgaads."}]

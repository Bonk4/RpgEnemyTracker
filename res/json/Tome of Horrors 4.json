On any round that a cimota first manifests (see below), its shifting forms affect it as a displacement spell. Attacks on a cimota at this time have a 50% miss chance as if the cimota had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, this displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting a cimota normally. This effect is canceled one round after a cimota manifests, or if a cimota takes any action in its new locale.  Lifesense (Su) A cimota notices and locates living creatures within 60 ft., just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Manifestation (Su) As a standard action, a cimota can transport itself via planar travel from any point on the Prime Material Plane to another point within its defined area, or within 300 ft. of the artifact to which it is bound. A cimota may also lurk on the Negative Material Plane, prepared to manifest on the Prime Material if certain conditions are met, such as trespassers entering the area they are doomed to guard. A cimota cannot attack or move in the same round in which it manifests, although it may manifest as partial surprise action before initiative. A cimota benefits from displacement (see above) on the round in which it first manifests.  Unholy Existence (Su) Although it is possible to temporarily destroy a cimota's physical form, it will return in 1d6 days, manifesting again to continue its unholy existence. The only way to permanently destroy a cimota is to disrupt its existence by consecrating the ground to which it is tied or the destruction of the artifact to which it is bound. Sometimes, significant alteration of an unholy place, such as demolition of an evil temple or burning a haunted forest, could cause cimota to fade away permanently. Although their physical forms may be damaged by normal attacks, their unholy existence grants them SR 17. Because cimota exist partially on the Negative Material Plane they are subject to banishment or other spells that affect outsiders.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals do not willingly approach within 30 ft. of a cimota unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. This aura takes effect when a cimota manifests on the Prime Material Plane. Animals that come within 30 ft. of a place where cimota are lurking on the Negative Material Plane, or an artifact to which a cimota is bound; Will be uneasy and show signs of disquiet."},{"Name":"Cobalt Viper","CR":"4.00","XP":"1200","Size":"Medium","Init":"7","AC":"18, touch 13, flat-footed 15","HP":"42","Fort":"7","Ref":"7","Will":"3","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.","Melee":"bite +9 (1d8+1 plus poison)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"","AbilitiyScores":"Str 12, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 10","BaseAtk":"5","CMB":"6","CMD":"19 (can't be tripped)","Source":"Tome of Horrors 4","SpecialAbilities":"Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save DC 17 Fort; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

On each successful attack, it gains 5 temporary hit points.  Malevolence (Su) Once per round, a screamer can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the screamer's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability the screamer must try to move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 16 Will save, but the target adds (or subtracts) its Charisma modifier to this saving throw roll. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same screamer's malevolence for 24 hours, and the screamer cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, the screamer vanishes into the target's body. Screamers prefer to use this attack after having made several Charisma drain attacks to weaken a target's resistance. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Rejuvenation (Su) A screamer cannot be killed through simple combat. If reduced to 0 hit points it disappears only to reform 24 hours later. The only way for a screamer to be truly laid to rest is for it to die while possessing a host body with its malevolence ability. When the body dies, the screamer spirit ceases to exist.

Any living creature within hearing distance of this scream (it can carry up to a mile outdoors) must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear attack. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same screamer's scream of hopelessness for 24 hours. The effects of multiple screamers' screams cannot stack. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Suicidal Frenzy (Su) If a screamer succeeds in possessing a target with its malevolence ability, it immediately begins to make suicidal attacks on the possessed body with the body's own weaponry. Each round, the screamer uses the body's full attacks to direct its weaponry against itself. It uses the possessed victim's attack and damage modifiers and must only succeed on an attack against the body's flat-footed armor class. Damage, including the possibility of critical hits, is rolled normally. Due to the inhabiting spirit, the possessed body continues its attacks even between -1 and -9 hit points, though only single attacks can be made at this point.

Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a grey spirit through simple combat: the \"destroyed\" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a grey spirit is to confront her with irrefutable evidence of her loved one's death. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different grey spirit by the GM."},{"Name":"Ice Salamander","CR":"5.00","XP":"1600","Size":"Medium","Init":"5","AC":"18, touch 11, flat-footed 17","HP":"59","Fort":"8","Ref":"6","Will":"4","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerability to fire","Speed":"30 ft., burrow 20 ft.

Engulf (Ex) A smoke elemental can engulf creatures of its size or smaller into its smoky form as part of a standard action. It cannot make any other attack in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that are not adjacent to them.  Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated neomimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive, but the neomimic can still grapple normally. A neomimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is Strength-based.  Alter Physique (Ex) At will as a standard action, a neomimic can alter its physical structure to affect its physique. A neomimic can shift points between its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution by reducing one or more of the scores while raising one or more by the same amount. The neomimic can shift no more than 12 points at one time and no score can be raised or lowered by more than 10 points.

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Heated Body (Ex) Any creature striking an amber skeleton unarmed or with natural weapons takes 2d6 points of fire damage (no save). Weapons striking an amber skeleton take this same fire damage unless the attacker succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) An amber skeleton is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted: A magical attack that deals fire damage heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the amber skeleton to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. An amber skeleton gets no saving throw against fire effects.  Vulnerability to Water (Ex) A significant amount of water, such as that created by a create water spell, the contents of a large bucket, or a blow from a water elemental, that strikes an amber skeleton forces the creature to make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 2d4 rounds. An amber skeleton that is immersed in water must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (the DC increases by +1 each subsequent round) or take 1d6 points of damage each round until the water is gone."},{"Name":"Aswang","CR":"6.00","XP":"2400","Size":"Medium","Init":"8","AC":"21, touch 14, flat-footed 17","HP":"60","Fort":"4","Ref":"6","Will":"7","DefensiveAbilities":"channel resistance +4","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerability to garlic","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +8 (1d4+2 plus grab), bite +8 (1d6+2/18-20)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"blood drain, deceiving sound, devour heart","AbilitiyScores":"Str 15, Dex 18, Con -, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 15","BaseAtk":"6","CMB":"+8 (+12 grapple)","CMD":"22","Source":"Tome of Horrors 4","SpecialAbilities":"Blood Drain (Su) An aswang can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the aswang establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks the feral vampire spawn makes.  Fast Healing (Su) A feral vampire spawn has fast healing 2. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a feral vampire spawn forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, it is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round.  Gaseous Form (Su) A feral vampire spawn can only assume gaseous form when it has been reduced to 0 hit points in combat. It then assumes gaseous form as the spell (caster level 5th) and returns to its coffin. While gaseous it has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.  Shadowless (Ex) A feral vampire spawn casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror.

Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the stone idol moves off them.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A stone idol is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone idol (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the stone idol's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.  A disintegrate spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol.  A chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight spell deals 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells.

On any round that a cimota first manifests (see below), its shifting forms affect it as a displacement spell. Attacks on a cimota at this time have a 50% miss chance as if the cimota had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, this displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting a cimota normally. This effect is canceled one round after a cimota manifests, or if a cimota takes any action in its new locale.  Lifesense (Su) A cimota notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Manifestation (Su) As a standard action, a cimota can transport itself via planar travel from any point on the Prime Material Plane to another point within its defined area, or within 300 feet of the artifact to which it is bound. A cimota may also lurk on the Negative Material Plane, prepared to manifest on the Prime Material if certain conditions are met, such as trespassers entering the area they are doomed to guard. A cimota cannot attack or move in the same round in which it manifests, although it may manifest as partial surprise action before initiative. A cimota benefits from displacement (see above) on the round in which it first manifests.  Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex) A black skeleton usually fights with a short sword in each hand. Because of its magical nature, its Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with both weapons at no penalty.  Unholy Existence (Su) Although it is possible to temporarily destroy a cimota's physical form, it will return in 1d6 days, manifesting again to continue its unholy existence. The only way to permanently destroy a cimota is to disrupt its existence by consecrating the ground to which it is tied or the destruction of the artifact to which it is bound. Sometimes, significant alteration of an unholy place, such as demolition of an evil temple or burning a haunted forest, could cause cimota to fade away permanently. Although their physical forms may be damaged by normal attacks, their unholy existence grants them spell resistance 17. Because cimota exist partially on the Negative Material Plane they are subject to banishment or other spells that affect outsiders.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a cimota unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. This aura takes effect when a cimota manifests on the Prime Material Plane. Animals that come within 30 feet of a place where cimota are lurking on the Negative Material Plane, or an artifact to which a cimota is bound; Will be uneasy and show signs of disquiet."},{"Name":"Huge Salt Elemental","CR":"6.00","XP":"2400","Size":"Huge","Init":"0","AC":"18, touch 9, flat-footed 17","HP":"68","Fort":"9","Ref":"2","Will":"6","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerability to water","Speed":"20 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +11 (2d6+5 plus salt poisoning)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"salt poisoning (11 rounds, DC 17)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 21, Dex 10, Con 17, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11","BaseAtk":"8","CMB":"15","CMD":"26","Source":"Tome of Horrors 4","SpecialAbilities":"Dehydration Aura (Su) A salt elemental's aura draws moisture from an area centered on itself.

Any creature slain by the dark custodian's energy drain is left a steaming, bloody skeleton, all of its soft tissues having been consumed by the undead.  Incorporeal Grab (Su) If a dark custodian hits with an incorporeal touch, it can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. During the course of this grapple, the dark custodian becomes partially corporeal and its opponent becomes partially incorporeal. This has no game effect other than allowing the dark custodian to use its Strength bonus in its CMB. If it wins the grapple, it establishes a hold at which point its opponent becomes completely incorporeal, as well, along with the dark custodian. The dark custodian automatically begins to devour the held opponent each round he is held. The opponent remains incorporeal until he manages to break the grapple at which time he becomes immediately corporeal. If this occurs within a solid object, the opponent is forcefully ejected from the object's nearest surface, and the opponent takes 1d6 points of damage in the process. The dark custodian must then try to hit with its incorporeal touch attack again to try to reestablish the grapple. Once the dark custodian has an opponent pinned, it attempts to drag him away to devour him in peace.  Lifesense (Su) A dark custodian notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch. Walls less than 5 feet thick are no impediment to this ability.  Silence of the Grave (Su) As a standard action a dark custodian can use its silence of the grave ability. This creates a silence effect as the spell in a 20-foot radius for 7 rounds. This silent zone acts as a desecrate spell giving the dark custodian a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws, as well as, imposing a -3 profane penalty on turn checks. Any living creature within the area of affect must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become dazed for 1 round. A new save is allowed each round. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. Because it takes place in an area of silence, it cannot be counteracted by bardic music. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the daze effect of the same dark custodian's silence of the grave for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) Dark custodians are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. A dark custodian caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a single move action or attack action in a round.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a dark custodian at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range."},{"Name":"Ghirru","CR":"9.00","XP":"6400","Size":"Large","Init":"3","AC":"23, touch 13, flat-footed 19","HP":"95","Fort":"10","Ref":"6","Will":"9","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerability to cold","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +15 (1d8+8 plus burn and grab), bite +14 (2d6+8 plus burn)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"burn (1d8, DC 20)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 27, Dex 17, Con -, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 20","BaseAtk":"7","CMB":"+16 (+20 grapple)","CMD":"30","Source":"Tome of Horrors 4","SpecialAbilities":"Burn (Ex) A ghirru deals burn damage each round it grapples.

Burn (Ex) A smoke elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires don't burn as hot as a true fire elemental's flames.  Engulf (Ex) A smoke elemental can engulf creatures of its size or smaller into its smoky form as part of a standard action. It cannot make any other attack in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that are not adjacent to them.  Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

A high cimota may use this power at the start of combat and every 1d3 rounds thereafter. This field of energy may take the form of black lightning either in a 20 ft. radius ball around the high cimota or as a 100 foot line extending from the high cimota's invisible fingertips. Dark fury inflicts 6d6 negative energy damage on any living creature in its area of effect unless it succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. This save is charisma based. Undead, constructs and other non-living objects are not affected by dark fury.  Displacement (Su) Cimota manifest on the Prime Material Plane as a shifting cloud of shadows that coalesce into their cloaked and hooded forms. On any round that a cimota first manifests (see below), its shifting forms affect it as a displacement spell. Attacks on a cimota at this time have a 50% miss chance as if the cimota had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, this displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting a cimota normally. This effect is canceled one round after a cimota manifests, or if a cimota takes any action in its new locale.  Manifestation (Su) As a standard action, a cimota can transport itself via planar travel from any point on the Prime Material Plane to another point within its defined area, or within 300 feet of the artifact to which it is bound. A cimota may also lurk on the Negative Material Plane, prepared to manifest on the Prime Material if certain conditions are met, such as trespassers entering the area they are doomed to guard. A cimota cannot attack or move in the same round in which it manifests, although it may manifest as partial surprise action before initiative. A cimota benefits from displacement (see above) on the round in which it first manifests.  Lifesense (Su) A cimota notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.  Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex) A black skeleton usually fights with a short sword in each hand. Because of its magical nature, its Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with both weapons at no penalty.  Unholy Existence (Su) Although it is possible to temporarily destroy a cimota's physical form, it will return in 1d6 days, manifesting again to continue its unholy existence. The only way to permanently destroy a cimota is to disrupt its existence by consecrating the ground to which it is tied or the destruction of the artifact to which it is bound. Sometimes, significant alteration of an unholy place, such as demolition of an evil temple or burning a haunted forest, could cause cimota to fade away permanently. Although their physical forms may be damaged by normal attacks, their unholy existence grants them spell resistance 17. Because cimota exist partially on the Negative Material Plane they are subject to banishment or other spells that affect outsiders.  Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a cimota unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. This aura takes effect when a cimota manifests on the Prime Material Plane. Animals that come within 30 feet of a place where cimota are lurking on the Negative Material Plane, or an artifact to which a cimota is bound; Will be uneasy and show signs of disquiet."},{"Name":"Kytha","CR":"9.00","XP":"6400","Size":"Medium","Init":"7","AC":"23, touch 13, flat-footed 20","HP":"112","Fort":"12","Ref":"6","Will":"8","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"20","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +16 (1d6+7), bite +16 (1d8+10/19-20), tongue +16 (1d6+7 plus poison)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"","AbilitiyScores":"Str 24, Dex 16, Con 22, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 16","BaseAtk":"9","CMB":"16","CMD":"29","Source":"Tome of Horrors 4","SpecialAbilities":"Poison (Ex) tongue-injury; save DC 18 Fort; frequency 1 round for 8 rounds; effect 1d6 Strength damage, creatures reduced to Str 0 suffocate; cure 2 saves.

A keen edge spell affects a philosopher golem's slam attacks as if they were slashing weapons. A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a philosopher golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no saving throw). A magical attack that deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.

Spells When a philosopher golem is created, it is programmed with spells. The creator can add as many or as few spells as desired up to the limit of the golem's caster level. A philosopher golem has a caster level equal to one-half its Hit Dice.

To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and 10 hit points. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals 10 points of damage to the dracohydra's body. A dracohydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties.  Regenerate Head (Ex) When a dracohydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. The heads are of the same color as the one that was severed. A dracohydra cannot have more than 10 heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage (after overcoming the dracohydra's resistances) must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A dracohydra doesn't die from losing its heads until all are cut off and the stumps seared by acid or fire.  Savage Bite (Ex) A dracohydra applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20."},{"Name":"Elder Salt Elemental","CR":"10.00","XP":"9600","Size":"Huge","Init":"0","AC":"22, touch 10, flat-footed 20","HP":"114","Fort":"12","Ref":"5","Will":"8","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerability to water","Speed":"20 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +18 (2d8+7 plus salt poisoning)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"salt poisoning (15 rounds, DC 20)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 25, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 10, Wis 11, Cha 11","BaseAtk":"12","CMB":"21","CMD":"33","Source":"Tome of Horrors 4","SpecialAbilities":"Dehydration Aura (Su) A salt elemental's aura draws moisture from an area centered on itself.

Such a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save each round that it is in the swarm or take ability damage for that round as indicated under the disease type. There is no incubation period for this type of exposure and its method of delivery is irrelevant due to the sheer concentration of disease organisms present. Even after a creature leaves the area of a swarm, it must make the appropriate Fortitude save or continue to take ability damage each day as indicated by the disease. At this point two successful saving throws in a row indicate that the creature has fought off the disease and recovers, taking no more damage. However, the disease can be contracted again through regular exposure or another encounter with a living disease. Once a creature has made a successful saving throw against the disease of a living disease, it is immune to future bouts of disease of that particular living disease for 1 year.  Festering Lung: This infection gets into the lungs of the affected creature and begins to break down the respiratory system, producing choking and copious amounts of bloody phlegm.

Vulnerability to Remove Disease (Ex) If a remove disease is cast on a living disease or a victim currently in a space occupied by a living disease and the living disease fails a Fortitude save against the spell, it deals 5d10 points of damage to the living disease. A creature that has remove disease cast on it is not cured unless outside of the swarm's area when the spell is cast or unless the living disease was destroyed by the casting of the spell.

A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed.

This shell has a hardnes of 10, takes half damage from energy attacks (except sonic attacks) and has hit points equal to 10 x (HD + 1). Bone armor weighs 1 pound per hit point. It can take damage like any object, though it receives the bone crawler's saving throws and spell resistance. Unlike carried objects, area of effect attacks require the bone crawler to roll a separate saving throw for its bone armor, even if it makes the saving throw itself. Spel l resistance is checked just once for the overall creature and its armor, however. While it bears bone armor, the bone crawler receives no bonus to AC for its Dexterity. After the first 10 hi tpoints of damage, every 10 hit points worth of bone armor provides the bone crawler with one bone blade that it can use in melee as described below. As its armor receives damage, it likewise loses these bone blades. The last 10 hit points of bone armor represent those protecting the main body itself; until the armor is destroyed, the central body is considered to have total cover. A bone crawler can repair its armor by absorbing new bones into its mass. This requires a 24-hour period while enzymes secreted by specialized tendrils harden the bone. The number of hit points gained depends on the size of the skeleton or bone collection absorbed: a Tiny skeleton repairs 1 hit point, a Small skeleton 1d4 hit points, a Medium skeleton 2d4 hit points, and Large and larger skeletons 4d4 hit points. Note that skeletons of Huge size and larger contain many bones that are too large for the bone crawler to absorb effectively into its mass, which is why the hit points gained do not increase after Large size.  Bone Blade (Ex) The bone crawler has a number of bony limbs that it can manipulate with its whipfronds. When attacking with these, it gains its full attack bonus as a primary weapon attack. It can only attack a creature or creatures in a single 5 ft. square with a maximum of 4 bone blades at once. Sunder attacks directed at bone blades do damage to the creature's bone armor (see above).  Whipfrond (Ex) The bone crawler's primary attacking tentacles are called whipfronds. It has one whipfrond per hit die. A whipfrond can be severed with a successful Sunder attack with a slashing weapon that inflicts, in a single blow, a number of points of damage equal to or greater than the bone crawler's hit dice. Whipfronds cannot be sundered while encased in bone armor; the armor must be destroyed first. As with the bone blades, the bone crawler can only attack a single 5 ft. square area with up to 4 whipfronds at a time, no more.  Whirling Frenzy (Ex) As a full round action the bone crawler may whirl its bone blades around it in a swirling storm of sharpened edges. This attack inflicts 1d8+4 points of damage per three bone blades used (round down) on anyone within the bone crawler's reach. A DC 19 Reflex save is allowed to take only half damage from this attack; alternately, a targeted creature may opt instead to make an attack of opportunity against the bone crawler instead.

If the bull rush is successful, the defender is automatically pushed back the distance that the battlehulk moves forward past his position. The battlehulk does not require a check result of 5 or more higher than the defender's check result to determine how far back the defender can be pushed. The battlehulk can bull rush as many opponents as occupy the squares in its path of travel with the usual -4 penalty to additional combat maneuver checks.  Charge (Ex) Each round a battlehulk double moves in a straight line, it adds an additional 10 ft. to its speed as its weight and inertia propel it forward. It can reach a maximum speed of 80 feet in this way. A battlehulk can stop after charging only by striking an unyielding obstacle (like a mountain) or by gradually slowing. It can reduce its speed by 10 feet per round as it slows its momentum. A battlehulk can only turn when going at a speed of 30 feet or less. If traveling downhill on a steep slope, the battlehulk accelerates twice as fast (i.e. it goes from 10 feet, to 30 feet, to 50 feet, etc.) and decelerate twice as slow (i.e. it takes 2 rounds to decelerate from 80 feet to 70 feet and so on). Likewise if traveling up hill on a steep slope it decelerates twice as fast and accelerates twice as slow.  Immunities (Ex) A battlehulk is immune to acid, cold, electricity, and fire and confers this immunity to anyone sealed within its inner compartment.  Ram (Ex) The ram attack of the battlehulk is with the ironplated and spike-studded front face. The damage this  attack deals is considered both piercing and bludgeoning. Because of the different metal compositions used in the spikes and enchantments placed on this front facing, this attack is both cold iron and adamantine and is considered magic and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This attack is particularly useful against evil outsiders.  Sweep (Ex) As a full round action a battlehulk can make a bull rush attack with each of its slamming arms on targets within range without provoking attacks of opportunity. Each stone arm is considered a Large creature for this purpose and has a combat maneuver bonus of +45. The flail on the back is also capable of making this bull rush attack on any targets atop the platform (roll separately for each target).

Each round it maintains its grapple, the gibbering abomination automatically deals 3d6+12 points of bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's blood.  Deathless (Su) When a gibbering abomination is slain, it is not truly dead, and 1 hour later it returns to life at 0 hit points, allowing fast healing thereafter to resume healing it. A gibbering abomination can be permanently destroyed only with death magic or complete incineration of its remains (such as dumping it into a pool of magma).  Disruptive Cacophony (Su) As a free action the gibbering abomination may produce a horrible quasi-arcane chanting that is highly disruptive to nearby magic effects. Any creature that can clearly hear this chanting (maximum range 100 ft.) must make a concentration check (DC 20 plus level of spell) to successfully cast a spell or use a spell-like ability. The check DC is Charisma-based. A gibbering abomination that uses this ability may not use any of its spell-like abilities on its current turn, or until the start of its next turn.  Pain Immunity (Ex) Because the gibbering abomination is already in incredible pain, it is immune to any effect or condition caused as a result of extreme pain or agony. This ability does not protect it against any physical damage it might suffer as well, however."},{"Name":"Lesser Banshee","CR":"13.00","XP":"25600","Size":"Medium","Init":"11","AC":"23, touch 23, flat-footed 15","HP":"142","Fort":"10","Ref":"12","Will":"13","DefensiveAbilities":"incorporeal traits","SR":"","Weaknesses":"sunlight powerlessness","Speed":"fly 60 ft.

During the final round of the vortex's duration, any creatures still trapped are pulled through the sphere of dim, white light in the kulgreer's tapered outlet. Such creatures must succeed on a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 12d6 points of damage. Those succeeding on their save take only half damage and are forcibly ejected from the kulgreer and flung 40 feet away. There is a 5% chance that any ejected creature is instead sent to a random plane of existence (GM's choice as to which one).

The save DC is Constitution-based.  Resistance to Poison (Ex) A ghaggurath is highly resistant to poison. Whenever it makes a saving throw against poison, it can roll its save twice, keeping the better result.  Spittle (Ex) In lieu of biting, a tentacle mouth can eject a fleshy worm, called a thrall worm, at a single target to a range of 50 feet. A target that is hit is automatically bitten by the worm and subjected to the ghaggurath's poison. Regardless of which head fires the worm, a ghaggurath can launch only 24 such worms in any 24-hour period.  When a thrall worm strikes its target, it quickly burrows into the target's body. This worm can be safely removed with a successful DC 30 Heal check or by the application of a cure spell; otherwise removing the worm deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to the target. After 1d4 rounds, the worm works its way so deep into the target's body that it can only be removed by cutting open the area (dealing 1d8 points of damage to the victim) before attempting a Heal check or casting a cure spell. A remove disease spell destroys the worm if the caster succeeds on a caster level check against DC 30. As long as a thrall worm remains inside a target, the target cannot heal the Wisdom damage dealt by the ghaggurath's poison. A creature can only ever have one thrall worm inside  it at one time; it can however be attacked by and bitten by multiple thrall worms. The check DCs are Constitution-based.  Thrall (Su) A victim whose Wisdom score drops to 0 from the ghaggurath's poison is automatically dominated (as by a dominate monster spell, CL 20th). This effect lasts until the thrall worm is removed and at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored. The ghaggurath does not have to concentrate each day to maintain this effect, and a dominated creature does not receive a save to break the effects. If the ghaggurath is slain, any thrall under its command fall unconscious and remain so until the thrall worm is removed and at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored."},{"Name":"Great Wyrm Gray Dragon","CR":"18.00","XP":"153600","Size":"Gargantuan","Init":"3","AC":"42, touch 5, flat-footed 42","HP":"362","Fort":"22","Ref":"15","Will":"22","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"29","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"60 ft., fly 250 ft.

At the end of its charge, the leviathan breaches, then slams down onto the target with incredible force. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the leviathan's space must make a DC 30 Reflex save or take 4d8+33 points of bludgeoning damage and be forced into the nearest square that is adjacent to the whale. This breach automatically attempts to capsize any boats caught wholly or partially in this area. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Tail Storm (Ex) As a full-round action, a leviathan can raise its massive tail and bring it crashing down into the water, causing a massive wave that sinks ships in the area. The resulting wave fans out from the leviathan's tail in a 100-foot cone. Huge or small er ships caught in the area and within 10 feet of the leviathan's tail automatically sink. Creatures in the water and within 10 feet of the leviathan's tail take 4d6+22 points bludgeoning damage. A successful DC 42 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Additionally, a creature that fails its save is pushed 6d6 x 10 feet away. Huge or smaller ships more than 10 feet away within the area must succeed on a Profession (sailor) check or capsize. The DC of this check is 42, decreasing by 5 for every 10 feet from the leviathan a ship is. The DC increases by a cumulative +5 for each size smaller than Huge a ship is. The save and base check DC is Strength-based.

Any living creature within 100 feet of a singing leviathan must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. A creature that succeeds on its save is unaffected by that leviathan's whale song for one day. This song is more felt than heard, and can be detected by creatures up to 10 miles away. Creatures capable of detecting extremely low-frequency sounds (e.g. dolphins, whales, other leviathans) can detect this song up to 100 miles away.

When activating magic items, it is considered to be using them as if a person of the required class, with a 20 in any relevant ability scores (or its natural scores, whichever are better). Furthermore, because of its innate magical nature, the save DC against any effects produced by magic items is 2 greater than normal. Finally, it can wield weapons and items as if it were of the appropriate size class for their type, so it suffers no hit penalties for being a Gargantuan construct with such items. Unless instructed otherwise, the amalgamation uses items at random from its bulk. However, it does not target them randomly-it uses them with care and precision, as if it had 18 Intelligence. Items with limited uses, such as scrolls and wands, are expended normally.  Multiple Attacks (Ex) The amalgamation can activate and use up to five items per round. It can therefore attack with weapons, activate magic items, hurl alchemical items like thunderstones, or slam random objects against opponents.  Swarm Attack (Ex) The amalgamation can move over enemies and damage them with the flying weapons and objects composing its bulk. It does this simply by moving over its victims, who are allowed either a DC 34 Reflex save or an attack of opportunity against the amalgamation, at their option. Anyone who begins their turn engulfed by the amalgamation takes 10d6 points of damage per round, with a DC 34 Reflex save allowed for half. This is not considered an area effect for the purposes of evasion and similar abilities. The damage inflicted by the amalgamation overcomes all forms of damage reduction except epic. The save DC for both Reflex saves is Dexterity-based. Further, this damage is considered continuous for the purposes of determining if it disrupts spellcasting, concentration and the like.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) The amalgamation is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted: Dispel magic and greater dispel magic can be used to deactivate magic items, as per a targeted item dispel.

Elementals receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day. Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control, obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals.  Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma check to gain control of the elemental.  Earth Glide (Ex) Onyst can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, he can even glide through lava. His burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of his presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing him flings him back 30 feet, stunning him for 1 round unless he succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.  Earth Mastery (Ex) Onyst gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both he and his foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, Onyst takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether Onyst is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.

The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than five rays at any single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 150 ft. Each of these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: cone of cold, disintegrate, dominate monster, energy drain, feeblemind, finger of death, flesh to stone, greater dispel magic, harm, hold monster, horrid wilting, implosion, inflict critical wounds, lightning bolt, magic missile, mage's disjunction, irresistible dance, baleful polymorph, power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, prismatic spray, slay living, and temporal stasis.  Flight (Ex) The gibbering orb's body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 20 ft. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent feather fall effect with personal range.  Gibbering (Su) The cacophony of speech emanating from the scores of mouths that make up the orb forces all within 60 ft. of the creature to succeed at a DC 29 Will save each round or suffer the effects of an insanity spell.  Steal Spell/Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su) When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature's known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use any two of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see above) that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours."},{"Name":"The Ravager","CR":"30.00","XP":"9830400","Size":"Gargantuan","Init":"7","AC":"45, touch 13, flat-footed 38","HP":"857","Fort":"39","Ref":"26","Will":"20","DefensiveAbilities":"magic disruption (1-4 on d20)","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"50 ft., burrow 20 ft.","Melee":"bite +46 (6d6+15/19-20/x3), 4 claws +46 (4d6+15/15- 20)","Ranged":"","Space":"20 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"trample (4d6+22, DC 42)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 40, Dex 24, Con 46, Int 6, Wis 25, Cha 24","BaseAtk":"35","CMB":"59","CMD":"76","Source":"Tome of Horrors 4","SpecialAbilities":"Death Resistance (Ex) The Ravager possesses an innate resistance to effects that would kill or permanently incapacitate it, including petrification and imprisonment.

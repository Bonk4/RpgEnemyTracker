Once per round, the vilkacis can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th), except it does not require a receptacle and lasts for up to 3 hours (or a number of hours equal to the vilkacis's Charisma modifier, whichever is greater). To use this ability, the vilkacis must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 18 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same vilkacis's bestial possession for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Upon being possessed by a vilkacis, the target takes on a number of bestial features, most notably growing claws and vicious fangs, and flies into a savage rage. The victim gains two claws and a bite natural attack appropriate to its size (1d4 and 1d6 for Medium creatures; see Table 3-1 on page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary), and gains a barbarian's greater rage class ability (see page 31 of the Core Rulebook).  This rage lasts for as long as the victim is being possessed by the vilkacis. After the possession ends, the victim is fatigued for a period of time equal to double the duration of the possession. The victim also gains low-light vision and scent.  The possessed creature loses all of these natural attacks and abilities immediately when the vilkacis leaves its body.  Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) Any humanoid who is bitten by a creature possessed by a vilkacis must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be infected with lycanthropy as if bitten by a werewolf. If the victim's size is not within one size category of the possessed creature's, this ability has no effect. The save DC uses the vilkacis's ability scores and is Charisma-based.  Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex) A vilkacis or creature possessed by a vilkacis can communicate and empathize with wolves and dire wolves. It can use its Diplomacy to alter such an animal's attitude, and when so doing gains a +4 racial bonus on the check.  Rejuvenation (Su) A vilkacis that is destroyed in combat restores itself after 2d4 days. The only way to permanently do away with a vilkacis is to locate its canopic stone, the occult artifact that binds it to the Material Plane, and then destroy the artifact in the presence of the vilkacis's mortal remains. Once the canopic stone is destroyed, the vilkacis can no longer rejuvenate and can be destroyed as normal.  Vulnerability to Silver (Su) Vilkacis are particularly susceptible to silver. A vilkacis struck with a silver weapon takes an additional 2d6 points of damage. If a creature under the effects of a vilkacis's bestial possession is damaged by a silver weapon, it also takes this extra damage and receives another saving throw to resist the bestial possession.  If successful, the possession ends, and the vilkacis is driven into an adjacent square and cannot use its bestial possession ability again until the following day."},{"Name":"Weaverworm","CR":"8.00","XP":"4800","Size":"Huge","Init":"18","AC":"20, touch 12, flat-footed 16","HP":"95","Fort":"7","Ref":"7","Will":"9","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., burrow 10 ft., climb 30 ft.","Melee":"1 bite +9 (2d6+7), 2 claw +9 (1d8+7 plus paralytic nails)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"drag, weaver's song, paralytic nails, web (+11 ranged, DC 19, 10 hp)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 24, Dex 18, Con 18, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 17","BaseAtk":"7","CMB":"16","CMD":"30 (can't be tripped)","Source":"AP 45","SpecialAbilities":"Drag (Ex) A weaverworm that successfully entangles a victim with its web attack can retract the web, dragging the victim into its clutches. Each round, the entangled victim can attempt a CMD check to escape. Upon a failed check, the weaverworm forcibly drags its victim 20 feet toward it.  Paralytic Nails (Ex) A weaverworm's nails secrete a potent paralytic agent. Any creature damaged by its claw attacks must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1 round. In addition, the weaverworm's nails break off in the bodies of those it paralyzes. A paralyzed creature must make another save to avoid being paralyzed again at the beginning of its round, doing so every round until the nail is removed as a full-round action. A weaverworm's nail can be removed with either a DC 12 Strength check, which removes the nail and deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim, or a DC 14 Heal check, which deals no damage. A weaverworm's paralytic nails don't affect any creature that is immune to poison. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Weaver's Song (Su) A weaverworm can play its webs like a grotesque musical instrument. When doing so, all nonweaverworms within 300 feet must make DC 18 Will saves.  Those who make their saves are unaffected. Those who fail are fascinated, and on their turn, move toward the weaverworm by the most direct means available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. A victim within 5 feet of the weaverworm simply stands and listens. This effect continues for as long as the weaverworm performs and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the victim is immune to the same weaverworm's song for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based."}]

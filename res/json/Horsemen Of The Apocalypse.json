As a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity, a lacridaemon can coat both of its claws with its tears, giving its next attack the possibility of poisoning its victim. A lacridaemon must attack with its claws on the same round or the round immediately after it applies its tears in order to use this ability; after that time, the tears lose their potency. Once it has attacked a creature using its tear-coated claws, a lacridaemon  must reapply the tears again in order to use this ability. A lacridaemon's bite attack is always treated as having its poisonous tears applied to it.  Lacridaemon poison: Injury; save Fortitude DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Wis plus staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Weeping Aura (Su) A lacridaemon emits an invisible aura that sounds like the whimpers of a crying child. The whimpers sound almost as if they're coming from all directions at once, or perhaps from one's own mind, disorienting those within the aura's area. Any creature that enters this area takes a -5 penalty on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. Creatures within the aura's range need not be able to physically hear the whimpers in order to be affected by this ability (and those who try to identify its origin so they can get nearer take a -5 penalty on their Perception checks to do so). A lacridaemon can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action, and the effects from multiple lacridaemon auras stack (up to a maximum penalty of -20). This aura is a sonic, mind-affecting effect."},{"Name":"Venedaemon","CR":"5.00","XP":"1600","Size":"Medium","Init":"6","AC":"18, touch 12, flat-footed 16","HP":"51","Fort":"5","Ref":"7","Will":"8","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"16","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., fly 30 ft.

Every creature within 30 feet must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 5d6 points of sonic damage and become sickened  for 1d4 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save takes only half damage and is not sickened. A suspiridaemon cannot perform this ability if it is currently grappling a creature with its tongue. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Strangle (Ex) Suspiridaemons have an unerring talent for seizing their victims by the neck. A creature that is grappled by a suspiridaemon cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.  Suffocate (Ex) A creature affected by the daemon's strangle ability cannot breathe and must hold its breath. Because of the daemon's thin air aura, this can quickly render an opponent unconscious.  Thin Air (Su) A suspiridaemon's aura makes the air around it difficult to breathe. Creatures that need to breathe can only hold their breath half as long as normal while within this aura, and suffer from altitude sickness as if in a low peak or high pass (see Altitude Zones, Core Rulebook 430)."},{"Name":"Sangudaemon","CR":"9.00","XP":"6400","Size":"Medium","Init":"9","AC":"23, touch 16, flat-footed 17","HP":"114","Fort":"12","Ref":"13","Will":"7","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Heal checks made to stop bleeding or stabilize a dying creature, Constitution checks made to  become stable, and saving throws against effects that deal bleed damage take a -4 penalty.  Contagious Gore (Su) A sangudaemon alters the very flow of blood when it attacks. Any creature that stops a bleed effect created by a sangudaemon must make a DC Fortitude save or gain the bleed effect the creature just stopped (this has no effect if the creature was stopping a bleed effect on itself ). A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Drain Soul (Su) A sangudaemon can revitalize itself by draining the soul of a dead creature. The target must be a creature the daemon dealt bleed damage to or used its blood drain ability on, and must have been dead for no longer than 1 minute. As a full-round action, it can drink the creature's soul dry, condemning the soul to Abaddon (though the soul can be returned to life as normal).

As a full-round action, the erodaemon can change into the form of this desired person as long as the target is a Small, Medium, or Large humanoid. The erodaemon gains a +20 bonus on its Disguise and Bluff checks to impersonate that person and avoid being detected as a fraud, but spells like true seeing negate this effect as normal. This effect ends if the erodaemon attacks any creature. Actions that could reveal the erodaemon as a fraud (such as performing an action that the imitated person would obviously not do, like cast a spell or speak Infernal) require the erodaemon to make an immediate Bluff check to continue the impersonation, with the erodaemon losing some or all of its bonus depending on the severity of the breach (GM's discretion).  Wilting Kiss (Su) An erodaemon can draw a mortal into a state of obsession with its kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before the erodaemon can use this ability. A creature affected by this kiss must make a DC 23 Will save or become obsessed with the erodaemon, an obsession the erodaemon feeds on. Each round the target is more than 30 feet away from the erodaemon, it must make an additional DC 23 Will save. Failing the save means that the sheer pain of her absence deals 1 point of Charisma drain to the subject that round. Succeeding at the Will save two consecutive times ends the effects of this ability. Spells such as dispel magic and break enchantment end this effect.

Arcane spell failure chances for armor are doubled. A creature that rolls a natural 1 on its attack roll automatically rerolls the attack against itself (01-50%) or an ally (51-100%). If there is no ally in range, the attack always targets the creature. A creature that rolls a natural 1 on its roll to cast defensively suffers a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps, Core Rulebook 491).

Any creature that does not succeed at a DC 27 Will save takes 1d6 points of Charisma drain and becomes shaken for 2d4 rounds; in addition, the phasmadaemon gains 5 temporary hit points for every point of Charisma drain dealt this way. If the creature being grappled is already panicked at the beginning of the phasmadaemon's turn, it must save instead on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be slain instantly by the phasmadaemon, which gains a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks for every 2 points of Charisma its victim had before dying; the profane bonuses last for 24 hours.

When an obcisidaemon successfully captures a soul with its inherit soul ability, the soul becomes a part of its cloak of souls, taking up one soul slot. An obcisidaemon has a number of soul slots equal to its Charisma modifier (usually 7). An obcisidaemon can consume a soul as a swift action to achieve a particular effect. When a soul within this cloak is consumed by the obcisidaemon, it is immolated as though by the destruction spell. Destroying the daemon frees the souls in its cloak, though this does not return the deceased creatures to life. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a cloak of souls requires a DC 28 caster level check. Failure results in the spell having no effect, while success tears the victim's soul free from the cloak and returns the creature to life as normal. If the daemon is in an unholy location, such as that created by the unhallow spell, the DC of this caster level check increases by +2. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based. An obcisidaemon can achieve one of the following effects by consuming a single soul.  � Increase the DC of the next spell-like ability the obcisidaemon uses that round by +1.  � Give the obcisidaemon 3d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.  � Increase the damage of the obcisidaemon's next melee attack that round by +1d6 hit points.  Inherit Soul (Su) Whenever an obcisidaemon kills a creature with its halberd, that creature must immediately make a DC 31 Fortitude save or be consumed by the daemon's cloak of souls. This is a death effect. If the cloak cannot consume this soul without exceeding its number of soul slots, the daemon can release a soul as a free action in order to make room for the new soul, otherwise, the killed creature automatically succeeds at its save and its soul is not absorbed. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Scorched Earth (Su) A creature that dies within 60 feet of an obcisidaemon must immediately make a DC 28 Fortitude save to prevent its body from being utterly consumed in unholy fire equivalent to the destruction spell. The save DC is Charisma-based."}]

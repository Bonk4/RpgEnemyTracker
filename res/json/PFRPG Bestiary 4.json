Once implanted, anything that the creature ingests is instead consumed by the alpluachra, including such substances as elixirs and potions or ingested alchemical items, diseases, drugs, or poisons. Once the alpluachra is implanted, the host creature begins suffering the effects of starvation and thirst (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444). Due in part to its numbing slime, an implanted alpluachra is difficult to detect. Each time the host creature ingests anything, it gains an automatic Perception check against the alpluachra's Stealth. After the newtlike fey is detected, it can be removed either by consuming at least half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water, by a remove disease spell cast on the host creature, or by treating the host with a successful DC 15 Heal check. When a Heal check made for this purpose fails by 5 or more, the host creature takes 1d6 points of damage. If the host attempts to remove the alpluachra by eating salt or drinking salt water, it must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d8 hours from the reaction with the alpluachra. If the alpluachra dies or becomes unconscious, it is immediately detected by the host creature, and can be removed safely as a full-round action.

Numbing Slime (Ex) Any creature that deals damage to an alpluachra with a natural attack or an unarmed strike, comes into contact with an alpluachra, or is host to an alpluachra must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or take a -4 penalty on all tactile Perception checks, as well as other skill checks requiring tactile senses (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand) for 24 hours. A host creature that fails this saving throw takes the penalty to detect the alpluachra implanted inside it. If the host creature succeeds at the saving throw, it can't be affected by the same alpluachra's numbing slime for another 24 hours.  Vulnerable to Salt (Ex) Half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water poured over an alpluachra or consumed by a creature an alpluachra has implanted itself in deals 1d3 points of damage to the alpluachra."},{"Name":"Changeling","CR":"0.50","XP":"200","Size":"Medium","Init":"-1","AC":"10, touch 9, flat-footed 10","HP":"8","Fort":"1","Ref":"-1","Will":"4","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +0 (1d4+1)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"hexes (cauldron)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 10, Dex 8, Con 12, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 15","BaseAtk":"0","CMB":"0","CMD":"9","Source":"PFRPG Bestiary 4","SpecialAbilities":""},{"Name":"Ectoplasmic Human","CR":"0.50","XP":"200","Size":"Medium","Init":"0","AC":"12, touch 10, flat-footed 12","HP":"7","Fort":"0","Ref":"0","Will":"2","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"slam +3 (1d4+3 plus horrifying ooze)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"horrifying ooze","AbilitiyScores":"Str 16, Dex 11, Con -, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 12","BaseAtk":"0","CMB":"3","CMD":"13","Source":"PFRPG Bestiary 4","SpecialAbilities":"Horrifying Ooze (Su) Any creature struck by an ectoplasmic creature's slam attack must succeed at a DC 11 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds.

The mindslaver mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved but before damage is rolled.  Infestation (Su) A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host, the mold shares the same 5-foot square with its host's space; this does not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the host takes a -4 penalty on Will saves against the mindslaver mold's dominate person spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free of a host with a successful DC 15 Strength check as a standard action-doing so deals 2d6 points of damage to the host as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no damage in this way.  Mold Mindlink (Su) A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other mindslaver mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver molds in this area as if it had a status spell in effect on all other molds.  Spore Pod (Ex) A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod the size of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack that has a range increment of 20 feet.  Spores (Su) Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the mold with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage as the mold's spores swiftly drain away the victim's willpower and sense of self.

A Medium necrocraft has 2 CP; differently sized necrocrafts have CP totals as detailed on the size chart on page 201. If a necrocraft is built with more CP than its size category would allow, its CR increases by 1 (minimum of +1) for every 2 additional CP spent. Unless otherwise stated, each of these abilities can be purchased only once. The stats presented here are for a Medium necrocraft (with 2 CP spent on additional movement [fly] and extra attack [bite]).  Additional Movement (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains a new mode of movement (burrow, climb, fly [clumsy], or swim) at a speed equal to its base speed.  All-Around Vision (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft has an additional head facing in the opposite direction from its main head, or has extra eyes grafted at various points around its body. The necrocraft gains all-around vision.  Blade Fists (Ex, 1 CP): Up to two of the necrocraft's claw attacks are replaced with sharpened bones or metal blades. These attacks deal 1d4 points of bleed damage. This ability can be selected multiple times, applying it to more claw attacks.  Bone Armor (Ex, 1 CP): Fortified with extra bone (perhaps including bones fused to its outer surface like armor), the necrocraft increases its natural armor bonus by 2. This ability can be selected up to three times.  Cannibalize (Ex, 1 CP): If the necrocraft is left near the corpse of a Medium or larger creature with discernible anatomy, it eats the corpse or tears off parts to repair its own substance. An undead creature consumed in this fashion heals the necrocraft 5 hit points plus 5 hit points per size category above Medium; any other type of creature restores only 1/5 this amount. Feeding takes 1 hour; any interruption (such as combat) requires it to start again.  Constrict (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft's claw attacks gain the constrict ability. It must have grab before this ability can be selected.  Disease (Su, 1 CP): One of the necrocraft's natural attacks is grafted with ghoul mouthparts, exposing a creature it hits to ghoul fever.  Ghoul Fever: Bite, claw, or slam-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast.  Extra Attack (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains an additional bite attack or claw attack. This ability can be selected multiple times.  Extra Legs (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains two more legs, increasing its base speed by 5 feet and increasing its CMD against overrun and trip attempts by 4. This ability can be selected multiple times.  Extra Strength (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft's Strength increases by 2 but its Dexterity decreases by 2. This ability can be selected twice.  Faster (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft's base, burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed increases by 10 ft.  Grab (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains the grab ability with its natural attacks.  Metal Armor (Ex, 2 CP): Metal plates are bolted to or fused with the necrocraft, serving as armor and granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC.  Mostly Skeletons (Ex, 1 CP): Most of the necrocraft's parts come from undead skeletons. The necrocraft gains DR 5/ bludgeoning and resist cold 5. This ability can't be added to a necrocraft with the mostly zombies ability.  Mostly Zombies (Ex, 1 CP): Most of the necrocraft's parts come from zombies. The necrocraft gains DR 5/slashing and 5 additional hit points. This ability can't be added to a necrocraft with the mostly skeletons ability.  Paralysis (Su, 2 CP): Up to three of necrocraft's natural attacks gain the paralysis ability (1d4+1 rounds, DC 13, elves are immune to this effect). This graft requires the body of at least 1 ghoul. For an additional Construction Point, the paralysis ability can affect elves.  Reach Attacks (Ex, 1 CP): Up to two of the necrocraft's natural attacks increase their natural reach by 5 feet. This ability can be selected multiple times. Rending Claws (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft gains the rend ability, activating when both claws hit and dealing additional damage equal to the damage dice for one claw plus 1-1/2 times the necrocraft's Strength bonus.  Rotting Flesh (Ex, 2 CP): Two of the necrocraft's bite or claw attacks are poisonous. Poison: bite or claw-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d3 Constitution damage; cure 1 save.  Stench (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft has the stench ability (10- foot radius, Fort DC 15 negates, sickened for 1d6+4 minutes). This graft requires the body of at least one ghoul.  Trample (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft gains the trample universal monster ability as a special attack."},{"Name":"Pard","CR":"3.00","XP":"800","Size":"Medium","Init":"7","AC":"20, touch 18, flat-footed 12","HP":"26","Fort":"5","Ref":"11","Will":"2","DefensiveAbilities":"evasion, improved uncanny dodge, uncanny dodge","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"120 ft.","Melee":"bite +12 (1d6+2), 2 claws +7 (1d4+1)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"phasing attack","AbilitiyScores":"Str 15, Dex 24, Con 12, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 11","BaseAtk":"4","CMB":"6","CMD":"24 (28 vs. trip)","Source":"PFRPG Bestiary 4","SpecialAbilities":"Empathy (Su) Pards can transmit complex emotions and basic ideas to other pards.

Once per round as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a brethedan can reshape its body and chemistry to adopt any of the following qualities.  � It gains resistance 5 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). � It gains an additional natural attack (bite, tentacle, etc.) with damage appropriate to its size.  � Its slam damage type changes to slashing or piercing. � Its slam damage die increases by one step (from 1d6 to 1d8 for most brethedans).  � It gains a +4 natural armor bonus to AC.  � Its reach increases to 20 feet.

Combine (Ex) Thanks to their perfect communication, brethedans can combine to work together as parts of a larger organism. As a swift action, a brethedan adjacent to another can merge with it, becoming a single creature occupying both spaces. The merging brethedan forfeits its actions to augment the other, and adds its hit points (though not its Hit Dice) to the new creature's collective total. At this time, it also chooses one adaptation-the combined creature gains this benefit, and it cannot be changed unless the combined creature uses its single adaptation action each round to do so. Any number of brethedans can merge in this fashion, but each adaptation can be gained only once (though resistances to multiple energy types are allowed). The combined creature retains the ability to swap one adaptation each round (not once per component creature).

A creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of ability damage from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs). The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Item Creation (Ex) A mi-go possesses the ability to create strange items that blur the line between magic and technology, given time and resources. This ability allows a mi-go to ignore all of the Item Creation feat requirements and spellcasting requirements for creating a magic item; the resulting item is always mi-go technology. A mi-go can use the Heal skill to craft mi-go technology. When a mi-go uses this ability to craft an item, it must use a larger amount of strange ingredients and expendable resources-this effectively doubles the gp cost to create the item.  Starflight (Su) A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)-provided the mi-go knows the way to its destination."},{"Name":"Mudlord","CR":"6.00","XP":"2400","Size":"Medium","Init":"7","AC":"19, touch 13, flat-footed 16","HP":"67","Fort":"8","Ref":"9","Will":"4","DefensiveAbilities":"amorphous","SR":"17","Weaknesses":"vulnerable to magic","Speed":"30 ft., swim 40 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +13 (2d6+3 plus grab)","Ranged":"mudball +12 touch (blindness)","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"engulf (DC 17, 1d6+3 bludgeoning and smother), smother","AbilitiyScores":"Str 17, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 7","BaseAtk":"9","CMB":"12","CMD":"25 (can't be tripped)","Source":"PFRPG Bestiary 4","SpecialAbilities":"Engulf (Su) A mudlord can engulf no more than one Medium or two Small or smaller creatures at a time.

This attack has a range of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 19 half) to the primary target and 3d6 points of fire damage to any creatures within 20 feet of the primary target. The magma continues to burn for 1d3 rounds, dealing an additional 3d6 points of fire damage per round to the primary target and 1d6 points of fire damage per round to any secondary targets. After the magma cools, it crumbles to dust. Once a lava drake has used its pyroclastic vomit, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

While under this effect, the creature takes a -4 penalty on all Will saving throws, and doesn't willingly travel farther than a mile from the area where it failed its saving throw against that colour's aura of lassitude. A break enchantment spell (DC 22) ends the effect, as does removing the victim from the aura's area of effect. Every 24 hours, a creature affected by an aura of lassitude can attempt a new DC 22 Will save to cast off the effects of the aura. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to that colour's aura of lassitude for 24 hours. A creature that is under the effects of an aura of lassitude from a colour out of space can't be further affected by this ability from other colours. This is a mind-affecting effect.

A successful DC 22 Fortitude save halves the damage caused by a colour out of space's touch attack. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a colour out of space's touch attack must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be immediately slain and reduced to a pile of fine ash. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Feed (Su) A colour can attempt to feed on any living creature or a region of plant life as a full-round action. If it feeds on a single creature, the colour must have line of sight and be within 300 feet of the target. If it feeds on a region of plant and animal life, it only needs to be within that region. It can attempt to feed on a region once per week, and upon a living creature at will (but only once per day per living creature). Feeding on a region of plant life is automatically successful, blighting that region of plant life as if by a diminish plants spell used to stunt growth. A creature can resist being fed upon by a colour out of space by succeeding at a DC 22 Will save, in which case the colour must wait 24 hours before attempting to feed on that creature again. If this saving throw fails, the victim takes 1d4 points of Charisma drain and Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature whose Constitution score is drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack immediately dies, crumbling into a mass of desiccated tissue. A creature whose Charisma score is drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack gains the colour-blighted simple template (see the facing page). Every time a colour successfully feeds on a creature, it gains 1 growth point. A colour out of space can never have more than 100 growth points-it can expend 100 growth points after spending 24 hours concentrating on its growth, and in so doing gains 1 permanent Hit Die.  Susceptible to Force Effects (Ex) A colour out of space takes half again as much damage (+50%) from force effects, and takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws to resist force effects. A colour out of space can't damage force effects with its disintegrating touch. Its aura of lassitude and feed ability is blocked if the colour is completely entrapped by force effects (such as by a windowless cell version of forcecage or a telekinetic sphere)."},{"Name":"Einherji","CR":"10.00","XP":"9600","Size":"Medium","Init":"7","AC":"24, touch 13, flat-footed 21","HP":"123","Fort":"12","Ref":"11","Will":"8","DefensiveAbilities":"freedom of movement","SR":"21","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"#ERROR!","Ranged":"mwk throwing axe +17 (1d6+4)","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"challenge of single combat","AbilitiyScores":"Str 19, Dex 16, Con 19, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 11","BaseAtk":"13","CMB":"17","CMD":"30","Source":"PFRPG Bestiary 4","SpecialAbilities":"Battle-Trained (Ex) An einherji is proficient with all armor.

Transfer (Ex) A bodythief can transfer a creature grappled with a tentacle to its mouth with a move action and a successful grapple combat maneuver check.  Vexing Vines (Ex) Each of the bodythief's tentacle vines plus its bite attack can deliver its own attack of opportunity, giving the bodythief five attacks of opportunity per round.

Partial Invisibility (Su) A flying polyp's body constantly flickers and shifts, passing from visibility to invisibility in a seemingly random pattern and often not wholly at once, leaving the creature's body in what appear to be multiple sections. This ability, combined with the flying polyp's amorphous, elastic form, makes it difficult to target the creature, granting it a 20% miss chance against all attacks. By concentrating, a flying polyp can become fully invisible. Sucking Wind (Su) This attack allows the flying polyp to send an eerie wind out to slow and eventually stop a creature's escape. The wind itself isn't particularly strong, but it creates a peculiar sucking sensation as if it were attempting to pull creatures back toward the flying polyp. Activating this ability is a full-round action, and it must concentrate each round to maintain the effect. The sucking wind manifests as a 100-foot-radius spread, with the flying polyp at the center. Each round the polyp maintains concentration, the sucking wind's radius increases by 100 feet, to a maximum radius of a mile. A flying polyp can detect creatures within this area via tremorsense. As a free action, it can increase the effects of the sucking wind on up to five different creatures within the area at one time. Each targeted creature must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area of the sucking wind or it is slowed until it leaves the area. A creature already under the effects of any slowing effect (such as from this sucking wind or a slow spell) that fails this save is held in place for 1 round-it is not helpless, but cannot move via any means. Freedom of movement protects against the effects of the sucking wind, and control winds negates its effects in the area of effect of the control winds spell. Natural windstorms or other powerful winds have no effect on a sucking wind. A flying polyp can activate a sucking wind once per day, and can maintain concentration on the effect for up to an hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Wind Blast (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a flying polyp can create a powerful blast of wind at a range of up to 120 feet. This blast of wind creates a sudden explosion of flesh-scouring wind in a 30-foot-radius burst. All creatures within this area take 14d6 points of bludgeoning damage, with a successful DC 26 Reflex save halving the damage. In addition, these winds can check or blow away creatures as if they were tornado-strength winds (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439).

A second, third, and fourth failed saving throw mean the creature is also staggered for 1 minute, nauseated for 1 minute, and helpless for 1 minute, respectively. This is a pain effect. If the dragon expends one use of mythic power when poisoning a creature, the dragon's breath weapon and poison overcome any poison immunity the target has.  Aura of Security (Su) A guardian dragon is alerted whenever a Tiny or larger creature enters its aura (as a mental alarm spell). If its dimensional lock spell-like ability is dispelled or destroyed, it may expend two uses of mythic power to cast it again. The dragon can use its false vision spell-like ability only within its aura, and the duration ends if the aura's area no longer includes the affected area.  Heroic Challenge (Su) Once per day, a guardian dragon can give a non-mythic creature the agile, arcane, divine, invincible, or savage mythic template (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 224). The dragon must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the amount the target creature's CR increases. The creature isn't under the dragon's control, but won't willingly attack the dragon unless magically forced to do so. Alternatively, the dragon can expend one use of mythic power to create difficult terrain in a 100-foot-radius burst; the type of difficult terrain is appropriate to the area (mud in plains, rubble in mountains, and so on). The effects of this ability persist as long as the dragon remains within 10 miles of the affected creature or area.  Lingering Poisonous Cloud (Su) The guardian dragon can expend one use of mythic power when it uses its breath weapon to have the cloud remain for 10 rounds, functioning as cloudkill. The dragon can expend one additional use of mythic power for this to function as mythic cloudkill.  Poison (Ex) Bite or swallow whole-injury; save Fort DC 33; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str and 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.  Secret Lair (Su) A guardian dragon can spend 1 hour concentrating to create a labyrinthine extradimensional lair for itself and whatever it is guarding. This functions like greater create demiplane (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 213) and creates a demiplane with the morphic, portal, shape, and structure properties. The demiplane is approximately a 500-foot-diameter sphere, and the dragon usually fills it with a maze of corridors (most of which are large enough for the Gargantuan dragon to move through) to confuse and delay invaders intent on stealing its treasure. The demiplane's portal is connected to a spot in the dragon's hidden lair, and over time the dragon usually brings guardian creatures from the Material Plane to add to the demiplane's defenses. The dragon can have only one demiplane active at a time, and the demiplane dissolves 10d10 minutes after the dragon leaves, so the dragon leaves only for a few minutes at a time or if its treasure has been stolen.  Vengeful Seeker (Ex) A guardian dragon gains the swift tracker and quarry abilities of a ranger when tracking or hunting any creature that has confirmed a critical hit against it, penetrated its spell resistance, or taken any amount of its treasure. Any divination spell-like ability a guardian dragon uses to locate such a creature or its treasure counts as the mythic version of the spell, if appropriate."},{"Name":"Drakainia","CR":"25.00","XP":"1638400","Size":"Huge","Init":"9","AC":"48, touch 13, flat-footed 43","HP":"642","Fort":"28","Ref":"15","Will":"6","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"36","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"50 ft., climb 30 ft., swim 30 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +31 (4d8+14/16-20/x4), gore +28 (4d6+7), 4 tentacles +29 (2d6+7)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.

Each day she can produce any number of creatures whose combined total base CR does not exceed 3 + her Constitution modifier (usually 21).  Gestation Aura (Su) A drakainia's aura pulses with developing life. All poisons or diseases active within her 30-foot aura have an onset of 1 round and a frequency of 1/minute. Impregnated creatures within her aura gestate in 2d4 rounds. Any creature born within her aura gains a mutation as if it were the drakainia's spawn, though if the creature's parent was not impregnated by the drakainia, the creature born is an infant of the kind its biological parents would produce, and doesn't count toward the CR limit the drakainia can spawn per day.  Impregnate Surrogate (Su) A drakainia can disgorge a monstrous embryo into the mouth of a living, corporeal creature that is pinned or helpless. She makes a grapple combat maneuver check, and if she succeeds she impregnates that creature regardless of its gender. A mythic character must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being impregnated; a non-mythic character is impregnated automatically. An impregnated creature's pregnancy lasts for 2d4 rounds. During this pregnancy, the victim is nauseated until the monster bursts forth from the victim's abdomen, which deals 10d6 points of damage to the pregnant creature and applies the broken condition to any armor it is wearing. Remove disease (DC 28) eliminates the unnatural embryo. Alternatively, as a full-round action another creature can attempt to cut out the growing monster with a DC 38 Heal check. On a successful check, the offspring is removed, and the formerly pregnant creature takes 1d4 points of bleed damage. On failed check, the pregnant creature takes 2d6 points of bleed damage and is stunned for 1 round, but the offspring is not removed. The creature spawned by means of this impregnation is any creature of the drakainia's choice that is at least one size category smaller than the creature she impregnated. These spawn count against the drakainia's daily CR allowance for birth spawn (see above).  Invert Birth (Su) When a drakainia uses her dimension door spell-like ability, instead of the normal range, she can choose to teleport to any space occupied by one of her spawn that is within 1 mile of her. She doesn't need line of sight or knowledge of the spawn's location. If she chooses a spawn that is farther than a mile away, she does not lose the use of the spell-like ability, but does lose the action. On arrival, she explodes out from her offspring, destroying it entirely.  Polymorphism (Ex) The spawn gestating inside the drakainia constantly alter her internal construction, making her immune to bleed, disease, poison, and polymorph effects. When she is subject to a critical hit or a sneak attack, this polymorphism grants her a 75% chance of negating such attacks.  Razor Claws (Ex) A drakainia's claws are razor sharp with a critical threat range of 17-20 and a critical multiplier of x4.  Transfer Suffering (Su) As a swift action, a drakainia can transfer a single harmful spell effect or condition from herself to one of her offspring that is currently within her gestation aura.  Well of Life (Su) A drakainia can unleash the primal life energy within in her body to channel positive energy as if she were a 20th-level cleric (DC 35). She can use this ability 18 times per day and can choose to expend 1 use of mythic power at each use to maximize the damage healed."},{"Name":"Bezravnis","CR":"26.00","XP":"2457600","Size":"Colossal","Init":"9","AC":"44, touch 7, flat-footed 39","HP":"615","Fort":"32","Ref":"24","Will":"20","DefensiveAbilities":"ferocity, recovery","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"100 ft., burrow 100 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +40 (4d6+18/19-20 plus grab), 3 stings +40 (3d6+18/19-20 plus 2d6 fire and poison)","Ranged":"","Space":"50 ft.","Reach":"50 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"burrowing charge, constrict (4d6+27), heat beam, hurl foe, poison, trample (2d8+27, DC 43), web (+27 ranged, DC 40, 30 hp)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 47, Dex 20, Con 40, Int 3, Wis 26, Cha 23","BaseAtk":"30","CMB":"+56 (+60 bull rush, +60 grapple)","CMD":"71 (73 vs. bull rush, 83 vs. trip)","Source":"PFRPG Bestiary 4","SpecialAbilities":"Burrowing Charge (Ex) Once per minute, Bezravnis can make a charge attack while burrowing through loose earth, sand, mud, or magma, or through any other loosely packed earth or stone. When Bezaravnis reaches the target, it erupts from the ground as part of its attack. If Bezravnis hits the target of its burrowing charge attack, it deals double damage with its attack. Any creatures standing in or flying less than 50 feet above the space Bezravnis occupies at the end of this charge are immediately subjected to Bezravnis's trample attack. Any buildings entirely within this space take double damage from the trample attack (4d8+54 points)-this damage bypasses hardness. In addition, Huge or smaller creatures must succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save or be buried in earth, as if by a cave-in or collapse. This bury zone extends into all squares affected by Bezravnis's reach.  Heat Beam (Su) Once every 4 rounds, Bezravnis can fire beams of searing heat and fire from one of its three stingers. Each stinger's heat beam is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju may fire one heat beam from a stinger as a move action, two heat beams as a standard action, or all three as a full-round action. Each heat beam is a 1,200-foot-long line that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to everything in its path (Reflex DC 40 half). If Bezravnis fires more than one heat beam, it can direct them in different directions. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Poison (Su) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect staggered for 1 round plus loss of fire immunity and resistance; cure 3 consecutive saves. As long as a creature suffers the effects of Bezravnis's poison, it loses all racial resistances and immunities to fire. Any spell or spell-like effects active when the target fails its initial saving throw against this poison are suppressed as long as it continues to be staggered by the poison. New effects of this nature that become active after that initial failed saving throw function normally if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 caster level check; otherwise, the spell effects are suppressed until the victim is no longer staggered.  Web (Ex) Bezravnis's webs are immune to fire damage. In addition, these webs are semi-living things that continue to crush and squeeze those entangled by them. If a creature is entangled in the webs, at the start of each turn during which it is entangled, it takes 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage as the webs crush and constrict it.

Shatter Spells (Su) Korada can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a wall of fire) by attacking it with an unarmed strike. He must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend 2 points of ki. If the attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted greater dispel magic (CL 20th). If he dispels an effect, he suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.  Tranquil Master (Su) Korada may attack without breaking his sanctuary spell-like ability so long as he only attempts to deal nonlethal damage."},{"Name":"Kostchtchie","CR":"26.00","XP":"2457600","Size":"Huge","Init":"6","AC":"44, touch 30, flat-footed 38","HP":"604","Fort":"35","Ref":"20","Will":"31","DefensiveAbilities":"Abyssal resurrection, freedom of movement, rock catching","SR":"37","Weaknesses":"vulnerable to fire","Speed":"60 ft., climb 60 ft.","Melee":"#ERROR!","Ranged":"rock +37/+32/+27/+22 (2d6+19)","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"clutch foe, crushing blow, favored enemy (giants +4, humans +4, see below), powerful slam, rock throwing (600 ft.), vengeful strike","AbilitiyScores":"Str 48, Dex 23, Con 38, Int 25, Wis 30, Cha 27","BaseAtk":"31","CMB":"+52 (+54 bull rush, +56 grapple, +56 sunder)","CMD":"86 (88 vs. bull rush, 88 vs. sunder)","Source":"PFRPG Bestiary 4","SpecialAbilities":"Clutch Foe (Ex) If Kostchtchie chooses to use his hand to make a grapple check when he successfully slams and grabs a Medium or smaller opponent, he takes a -20 penalty on the grapple check. On following rounds, he can attempt to maintain his grapple on the creature as a swift action. If successful, he can constrict the creature for 1d8+28 points of damage, throw the creature (treat this as a bull rush), or use the creature as an improvised weapon. An opponent used as a weapon takes half as much damage as it deals to the creature it hits.  Crushing Blow (Su) Once per round, Kostchtchie may designate any attack with his warhammer to be a crushing blow. He must designate this attack before making the attack roll. If he hits, the blow ignores the target's hardness and damage reduction, and allows him to make a free trip attempt against the target. This trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity, can target a foe of any size, and has no chance of causing Kostchtchie to fall prone if he fails. A creature struck by a crushing blow must attempt a DC 44 Fortitude save; success means the creature is staggered for 1 round, and failure means it is stunned for 1 round and staggered for 1d6 rounds afterward. The save DC is Strength-based. Favored Enemy (Su) Against female giants or female humans, Kostchtchie's favored enemy bonuses increase to +8. Once per day, he can declare any one creature as a favored enemy, but only if that creature has damaged, humiliated, or otherwise inconvenienced him at some point in the previous 24 hours. His favored enemy bonuses against that creature last 24 hours.  Powerful Slam (Ex) Kostchtchie's slam attack is considered a primary attack even when he uses a weapon in his other hand, and he always adds his full Strength bonus to damage dealt with his slam attack.  Vengeful Strike (Su) Once per round, Kostchtchie may make an attack of opportunity against any creature that strikes him in melee combat. This attack of opportunity has a critical threat range of 18-20. Against female targets, the vengeful strike is also a crushing blow."},{"Name":"Agyra","CR":"27.00","XP":"3276800","Size":"Colossal","Init":"11","AC":"45, touch 9, flat-footed 38","HP":"656","Fort":"33","Ref":"25","Will":"21","DefensiveAbilities":"electrified corpse, ferocity, rebirth, recovery","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"80 ft., fly 200 ft.

Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded and staggered for 1d6 rounds by the blast of light. A successful saving throw reduces the blindness to 1 round and negates the staggered effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, each of Agyra's twin heads can breathe out a line of electricity to a range of 1,200 feet. Agyra can breathe each line in a different direction. Each creature caught in a line of electricity must succeed at a DC 41 Reflex save or take 20d6 points of electricity damage and be staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. A creature struck by both breath weapons simultaneously must attempt separate saving throws against each breath weapon, but takes a -4 penalty on both-the damage and staggered condition duration stack with each other. A creature wearing medium or heavy metal armor or a creature composed mostly of metal that fails its saving throw is also stunned for 1 round. A creature slain by Agyra's breath weapon remains electrified for 2d4 rounds after death-any creature that touches the body automatically takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Electrified Corpse (Su) If Agyra is slain, her corpse crackles and flashes with pulses of electrical light if she has not used her rebirth ability that year. Any creature that touches her corpse takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Even if Agyra's body is destroyed, the site of her death continues to carry this electrical charge for 1 minute, or until Agyra is reborn, whichever comes first.  Hurricane (Sp) Once per day, Agyra can create a supernatural hurricane surrounding herself. This effect functions as control weather, save that it affects an area with a 4-mile radius, lasts for 24 hours, and can only be used to create hurricane-force winds. The hurricane created is static, and features a calm eye at the center with a 500-foot radius.  Rebirth (Su) Agyra remains dead for only 1 minute before she come back to life, as if via a true resurrection spell. Agyra rises from the exact same position she occupied when she died, and typically takes advantage of this second chance to use her swift flight to escape as soon as possible. Agyra can only be reborn in this manner once per year; if she is slain a second time before a year has passed, her death is permanent and her corpse does not become electrified. This ability replaces Agyra's ability to immediately heal damage that would normally kill her, granted by her recovery ability, but does not replace the other defenses granted by recovery.  Storm Flier (Ex) Agyra does not take penalties on Fly checks when flying in strong or more powerful winds.  Swift Flight (Su) As a standard action once per hour, Agyra can fly in a straight line at an incredible speed. She may travel up to 1 mile in this manner-doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When Agyra activates this ability, her thunderous blast ability is automatically triggered from the swift flight's point of origin.  Thunderous Blast (Su) When Agyra uses her swift flight, she creates a thunderous sonic boom. This devastating explosion of sound occurs at her location when she activates swift flight, filling an area equal to her space and her reach combined-resulting in a 100-foot-diameter burst of sonic energy. All creatures in this area of effect take 20d10 points of sonic damage, are permanently deafened, are knocked prone, and are stunned for 1 round. A successful DC 41 Reflex save halves the damage, reduces the deafened condition to 1d4 rounds, and negates the knocked prone and stun effects entirely.

A foe that is normally immune to poison can be affected by Bokrug's poison in this way, but treats the poisoning as if it had been injected with only 1 dose.  Immortality (Ex) If Bokrug is killed, his body immediately begins to thrash and writhe spasmodically, continuing to do so for 1d4 rounds. During this time, he makes a single sting attack against one random target in reach. At the end of this time, his body grows still, then melts into water and evaporates away. Bokrug reforms in dormancy back in his realm in the Dimension of Dreams soon thereafter, remaining in a comatose state for hundreds of years unless he is awoken earlier via complex rituals. Any effect that destroys Bokrug's body (such as disintegrate) merely reduces his remains to water that then evaporates away as described above, but such measures do prevent his body from thrashing and stinging prior to this supernatural evaporation.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 41; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 2d4 Wisdom damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. A creature whose Wisdom damage equals its Wisdom score automatically becomes afflicted by a random insanity (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Spines (Ex) Any creature that makes a melee attack against Bokrug must succeed at a DC 33 Reflex save or be struck by the numerous swiftly reacting spines that cover the Great Old One, taking 2d6+15 points of damage. Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. The save DC is Dexterity-based.  Toxic Breath (Su) Bokrug's breath is toxic. Whenever the Great Old One is above water, he is surrounded by a 30-foot-radius cloud of invisible poison gas that causes temporary madness and hallucinations. Any creature that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that holds its breath or doesn't have to breathe gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw. This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Unspeakable Presence (Su) Failing a DC 33 Will save against Bokrug's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become overwhelmed with hopelessness and doom-it takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls as long as it remains within the area of affect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Vengeful Dreams (Su) Any creature that has ever damaged Bokrug or has slain one of his clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One's vengeful dreams regardless of the distance between the creature and Bokrug, even across planar boundaries. In order to use vengeful dreams against a target, Bokrug must successfully affect the target with his nightmare spell-like ability; the target is always treated as familiar to Bokrug, and as if Bokrug possessed a body part of the victim, resulting in a -15 penalty on the saving throw against the nightmare. If the victim fails its save against the nightmare, the horrific dream unfolds as a vision of Bokrug consuming the victim alive. The victim then remains alive, conscious, and aware as the Great Old One digests it, and as Bokrug destroys all that remains of the victim's lifelong friends, home, belongings, and family. When the victim awakens from the nightmare, it must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or take 3d6 points of Wisdom drain from the vengeful dreams. If this drains the target's Wisdom to 0, it automatically gains a random insanity (GameMastery Guide 250). Once Bokrug uses this ability against a creature, he can't do so again until that creature again damages him or slays one of his clerics. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Underwater, this cone manifests as black ink, while above water it manifests as a thick cloud. Creatures in the area have their vision obscured as if they were in complete darkness. Darkvision does not allow someone to see through the ink or smoke, but true seeing does. The ink or smoke persists for 1d4 rounds, but dissipates in 1 round in areas with aquatic currents or winds. Any creature in the breath weapon's area is exposed to the breath weapon's poison (see below) and must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or gain 2 negative levels as its memories and knowledge leach away (this is a mind-affecting effect). Any creature that enters the ink or cloud, or ends its turn inside it, must succeed at another Will save (at a +4 bonus) to avoid further level loss and poisoning. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Command Aquatic Creature (Su) Dagon can command aquatic creatures to do his bidding as a move action, either via using his ability to speak with animals or via telepathy. This affects all aberrations, animals, magical beasts, oozes, and vermin within 300 feet that have the aquatic subtype (Will DC 36 negates). This functions like mass suggestion, but can affect mindless creatures. Dagon can suggest obviously harmful or suicidal acts (though non-mindless creatures gain a +10 bonus on their saving throws against these suggestions). The commanded course of activity can have a duration of up to 1 hour. If Dagon issues a new command to a creature, the previous command is discarded. Once a creature succeeds at its save against this effect, it is immune to further commands from Dagon for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Poison (Ex) Breath weapon-contact; save Fort DC 41; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con drain and confused for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Transformation (Su) A creature swallowed by Dagon is assaulted by demonic enzymes, rasping talons, sucking tendrils, and vile gases. At the start of the swallowed creature's turn, it must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be nauseated, and must succeed at a DC 36 Will save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity and Charisma drain. Once the creature's Dexterity and Charisma are drained to 0, the creature transforms into a horrifically deformed version of itself that Dagon can then disgorge into any adjacent square as a swift action. The transformed creature gains the half-fiend template, its Dexterity and Charisma return to their normal values, and it is under Dagon's control (as dominate monster, caster level 28th). The transformation can be reversed by casting break enchantment and atonement on the victim during the first 24 hours (after that, it can be reversed only via miracle or wish).

Damage blocked by one of his resistances or immunities instead heals him an amount equal to the damage dealt. He may absorb only one kind of energy in this manner in a round. The first type of energy that affects him in a round (whether or not it penetrates his immunities or resistance to actually damage him) sets the type of energy he absorbs for that round. Hit points gained in excess of his normal maximum are lost. Mogaru cannot gain healing from energy effects generated by himself.  Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 4 rounds, Mogaru can breathe out a beam of fiery red force. When Mogaru uses this attack, he can choose to focus the breath weapon into a single 1,200-foot-long line, or he can shorten the range and turn his head and body while breathing, effectively affecting a 600-foot-long cone. All creatures caught in this area of effect take 20d6 points of fire damage, 20d6 points of force damage, and are staggered for 1d6 rounds from the devastating energy (Reflex DC 42 halves the damage and prevents the staggered effect). A creature slain by this effect is disintegrated, whether the saving throw was successful or not. This breath weapon is particularly effective at blasting through cover-cover does not grant any bonuses on Reflex saves against Mogaru's breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Firebolts (Su) As a standard action on any round immediately following the use of his breath weapon, Mogaru can fire bolts of red energy from the glowing spines along his back. These bolts are ranged touch attacks with a range of 1,200 feet. When Mogaru uses this ability, he must choose between firing one firebolt, three firebolts, or six firebolts. If he fires one, it deals 20d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires three bolts, each deals 8d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires six bolts, each deals 5d6 points of damage on a hit. Half of the damage caused by any one firebolt is fire damage, the other half is force damage. Firebolts deal full damage against objects, and ignore the first 10 points of hardness possessed by an object.  Reflexive Breath (Ex) The first time in any round that Mogaru can make an attack of opportunity, he can choose to use a diminished version of his breath weapon instead of making a physical attack. This reflexive breath weapon attack only targets the creature that provoked the attack of opportunity, but otherwise causes the same damage and effects his breath weapon normally inflicts (Reflex DC 32 halves the damage and negates the staggered effect). Use of his breath weapon in this way does not affect the recharge rate of the regular breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a -10 penalty to reflect the fact that the reflexive breath is a shorter (but no less intense) blast of energy than the kaiju's typical breath weapon attack.  Sense Kaiju (Su) Mogaru can sense the location of the nearest active kaiju, as if using discern location, at will.  Susceptible to Song (Ex) Mogaru's actions can be influenced by song, provided the kaiju notices the singing. If the kaiju is not currently engaged in battle, he automatically hears any song within 100 feet that is directed at him in an attempt to influence him, but when he is in combat, there's only a cumulative 20% chance per round of sustained singing that he notices the song. In order to influence Mogaru, the singer must make a DC 35 Perform (sing) check (this check cannot be bolstered by the aid another action, and the singer cannot take 10 or 20 on the check). The result of this check sets the DC of the Will save Mogaru must make in order to not be influenced by the song. The singer can choose to influence Mogaru as if she had successfully cast suggestion on the kaiju (CL = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing]). If Mogaru succeeds at a Will save (DC = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing] + the singer's Charisma modifier), the effects of the influence last for a maximum of 1d4 rounds; otherwise, the effects last as long as a suggestion spell would normally last. Mogaru cannot use his recovery ability to recover from song influence, and a single singer may influence Mogaru only once per day."},{"Name":"Vildeis","CR":"28.00","XP":"4915200","Size":"Large","Init":"13","AC":"44, touch 19, flat-footed 34","HP":"610","Fort":"31","Ref":"20","Will":"26","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft., fly 60 ft.

In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must also succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be compelled to seek out a Yellow Sign, throwing all of his resources and actions into the obsession. While obsessed, the target takes a -4 penalty on Will saving throws, saving throws against symbol spells, concentration checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks. This obsession effect ends immediately if the victim looks upon the Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Immortality (Ex) If Hastur is slain, the robes that drape his frame suddenly drop to the ground as if whatever shape supported them had suddenly ceased to exist. The robes themselves remain inanimate on the ground, but any humanoid creature that touches them must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to resist a sudden urge to put the robes on. Doing so is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once it has donned Hastur's robes, the creature immediately perishes and its body is destroyed. In its place, Hastur lives again, as if brought back via true resurrection. If the discarded robes are not donned within 24 hours, they fade away, leaving behind a faint yellow stain. In this case, Hastur can't manifest a physical body again until the conditions are right, or until an unwitting cultist or fool calls him forth once again. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Reveal Visage (Su) As a swift action, Hastur may reveal to one adjacent creature the true shape beneath his robes. The creature must succeed at DC 40 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain at the end of its turn each round the paralysis lasts, though the revelation is too awful for memory to retain. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Tattered Lash (Ex) Hastur attacks with long strips of his tattered yellow robes. These strips have a reach of 40 feet and are primary natural slashing attacks. Bleed damage from the strips stacks with itself (up to 10d6 points of bleed damage). Hastur treats insane targets as if they were flat-footed when he attacks with these weapons.  Unspeakable Presence (Su) Failing a DC 40 Will save against Hastur's unspeakable presence afflicts a creature with a random insanity. A creature that is already insane instead becomes confused for as long as it remains in the area. The save DC is Charisma-based. Wish (Sp) Although Hastur may use wish as a spell-like ability at will, he can do so only to grant the wishes of other creatures, and only once per creature. Invariably, the results of these wishes serve somehow to advance Hastur's agenda.  Yellow Sign (Su) Once per day as a free action, Hastur can touch any solid surface and inscribe the Yellow Sign upon it. Once inscribed, the Yellow Sign remains for a year, but is active only on certain nights when the light from Hastur's distant world shines in the night sky as a star. Any creature that looks upon an active Yellow Sign must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to avoid becoming dominated by Hastur (as dominate monster); whether or not the save is successful, the creature doesn't have to save against that Yellow Sign again for 24 hours. While the creature is under this domination effect, if the creature's Charisma drain plus Charisma damage ever equal its Charisma score, it immediately dies and allows Hastur to manifest physically at the location of its corpse, as if the victim had donned Hastur's tattered robes (see immortality). A Yellow Sign can be removed with dispel chaos, dispel evil, or erase, any of which requires the caster to succeed at a DC 35 caster level check.

Spells Cernunnos casts spells as 20th-level druid.  Unbound (Su) Cernunnos is immune to any effects that restrict or force extradimensional movement upon him, such as banishment or dimensional anchor. He may allow these effects to affect him."},{"Name":"Cthulhu","CR":"30.00","XP":"9830400","Size":"Colossal","Init":"15","AC":"49, touch 29, flat-footed 44","HP":"774","Fort":"29","Ref":"29","Will":"33","DefensiveAbilities":"freedom of movement, immortality, insanity (DC 40), non-euclidean","SR":"41","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"60 ft., fly 200 ft.

Make one attack roll; any creature in the area whose AC is equal to or lower than the result takes damage from the claw.  Dreams of Madness (Su) When Cthulhu uses his nightmare spell-like ability on a creature with one or more ranks in a Craft or Perform skill, he also afflicts the creature with maddening dreams. In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or contract a random insanity (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250). This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that already has an insanity is immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Greater Starflight (Su) Cthulhu can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through outer space at incredible speeds. Although the exact travel time will vary from one trip to the next, a trip within a solar system normally takes Cthulhu 2d6 hours, and a trip beyond normally takes 2d6 days (or more, at the GM's discretion).  Immortality (Ex) If Cthulhu is killed, his body immediately fades away into a noxious cloud of otherworldly vapor that fills an area out to his reach. This cloud blocks vision as obscuring mist, but can't be dispersed by any amount of wind. Any creature in this area must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains in the cloud and for an additional 1d10 rounds after it leaves the area. Cthulhu returns to life after 2d6 rounds, manifesting from the cloud and restored to life via true resurrection, but is staggered for 2d6 rounds (nothing can remove this staggered effect). If slain again while he is staggered from this effect, Cthulhu reverts to vapor form again and his essence fades away after 2d6 rounds, returning to his tomb in R'lyeh until he is released again. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Non-Euclidean (Ex) Cthulhu does not exist wholly in the physical world, and space and time strain against his presence. This grants Cthulhu a deflection bonus to AC and a racial bonus on Reflex saves equal to his Charisma modifier (+12). His apparent and actual position are never quite the same, granting him a 50% miss chance against all attacks. True seeing can defeat this miss chance, but any creature that looks upon Cthulhu while under the effects of true seeing must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be afflicted by a random insanity (this is a mind-affecting effect). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Tentacles (Ex) Cthulhu's tentacles are a primary attack.  Unspeakable Presence (Su) Failing a DC 40 Will save against Cthulhu's unspeakable presence causes the victim to immediately die of fright. This is a death and fear effect. A creature immune to fear that fails its save against Cthulhu's unspeakable presence is staggered for 1d6 rounds instead of killed. The save DC is Charisma-based."},{"Name":"Pazuzu","CR":"30.00","XP":"9830400","Size":"Large","Init":"13","AC":"48, touch 38, flat-footed 39","HP":"752","Fort":"31","Ref":"32","Will":"35","DefensiveAbilities":"Abyssal resurrection, avian mastery, freedom of movement","SR":"41","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"60 ft., fly 150 ft.

In any round in which he does not move more than 5 feet, he is surrounded by a 10-foot-radius spread of these creatures. Any creature that enters this area must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Avian Mastery (Su) Any creature flying under its own power (flight from a source other than a spell, spell-like ability, or magic item) that attempts to attack Pazuzu with a melee attack must attempt a DC 40 Will save. If it fails, the creature can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack Pazuzu for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Hear Name (Su) Pazuzu hears his name whenever it is spoken, regardless of distance-this ability functions even across planar boundaries. If a creature speaks Pazuzu's name aloud three times in the same breath, Pazuzu automatically knows that creature's precise location and name. If Pazuzu is on the same plane as someone who speaks his name three times in a single breath, he can immediately attempt to possess that creature.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 43; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Wisdom drain and nauseated; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Possession (Su) Once per day as a swift action, Pazuzu can attempt to possess a single living creature within 1 mile, provided he knows the target's name. The target can resist this possession attempt by succeeding at a DC 43 Will save. A lawful creature gains a +10 bonus on this saving throw, and a good creature gains a +20 bonus on the saving throw (these bonuses stack). If the creature successfully saves, it is immune to possession attempts by Pazuzu for the rest of its life. If the saving throw fails, Pazuzu can control the possessed creature from afar. While possessing a creature, Pazuzu automatically knows every thought that creature has. By concentrating, he can sense the creature's surroundings using that creature's senses. As a swift action, he can cause the creature to perform any ability it can perform on its own. Pazuzu can use any of his spell-like abilities through a possessed target, with the effects resolving as if the possessed creature had created the effect. Possession is permanent, but Pazuzu can only possess one creature at a time. When Pazuzu isn't actively controlling the target, it can take its own actions. Dispel chaos or dispel evil ends this possession effect as if it were an enchantment spell, but unless the caster of the spell succeeds at a DC 30 caster level check, as a swift action Pazuzu can attempt to possess the caster as he is driven out of the target. A creature possessed by Pazuzu is immune to protection from evil, magic circle against evil, and any similar effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Profane Wishcraft (Su) A creature that accepts a wish from Pazuzu immediately becomes chaotic evil unless it succeeds at a DC 43 Will save. A creature that becomes chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a good hope spell for 1 week, followed by the effects of crushing despair for 1d6 months (CL 30th). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Swarm Master (Su) Pazuzu is immune to swarm damage and other swarm effects (such as distraction). As a swift action, he can direct the movement of any swarm within 30 feet."}]

While some might come into being at age categories other than adulthood, they never leave their original age category. Spells and effects that cause aging affect a shabti as normal.  Immune to Undeath (Ex) Shabti can't become undead. Spells and abilities that would transform a shabti into an undead creature have no effect.  Past-Life Knowledge (Ex) Shabti remember bits of their past lives. As a result, they treat all Knowledge skills as class skills.  Resist Level Drain (Ex) A shabti takes no penalties from energy drain effects, though he can still be killed if he accrues more negative levels than he has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels a shabti takes are automatically removed without the need for an additional saving throw.  Shattered Soul (Ex) Shabti who are killed are exceptionally difficult to return to life. Those who attempt to return a shabti to life using raise dead, resurrection, or similar spells must succeed at a caster level check equal to 10 + the shabti's Hit Dice. If this check fails, the spell fails and the caster can't return the shabti to life for the next 24 hours (though the caster can try again after this period)."},{"Name":"Mummy Lord","CR":"10.00","XP":"9600","Size":"Medium","Init":"2","AC":"18, touch 14, flat-footed 15","HP":"107","Fort":"11","Ref":"7","Will":"11","DefensiveAbilities":"channel resistance +4, undying will","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"#ERROR!","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"channel negative energy 8/day (DC 21, 5d6), channel rot, insidious mummy rot (DC 19), sandstorm wrath (DC 19, 6d8 fire and slashing), scythe of evil (4 rounds, 1/day), undead mastery (DC 19)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 20, Dex 14, Con -, Int 10, Wis 20, Cha 20","BaseAtk":"6","CMB":"11","CMD":"25","Source":"AP 84","SpecialAbilities":""},{"Name":"Neshmaal","CR":"12.00","XP":"19200","Size":"Large","Init":"11","AC":"24, touch 24, flat-footed 16","HP":"149","Fort":"14","Ref":"11","Will":"12","DefensiveAbilities":"incorporeal","SR":"23","Weaknesses":"vulnerable to sonic","Speed":"fly 50 ft.

Any creature that comes within 20 feet of a neshmaal must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. If a creature is within the auras of multiple neshmaals, only a single save is required, but the save DC increases by 2 for each additional neshmaal (for example, the presence of two neshmaals increases the usual save DC to 25). Arcane spellcasters are especially vulnerable to this aura. The DC to cast spells defensively within the aura increases by 4, and the neshmaal can make an attack of opportunity against an arcane caster who fails to cast defensively. This secondary effect occurs even if the arcane caster succeeded at her save against the shaken condition. Once a creature is exposed to a neshmaal's aura, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  Dominate Person (Sp) A neshmaal can dominate only one target at a time when using its dominate person spell-like ability. If a neshmaal uses its dominate person spell-like ability on a new target while already dominating another creature, the previous target is immediately released from the neshmaal's control. This occurs whether or not the new attempt is successful.  Kiss of the Void (Su) Three times per day, a neshmaal may forgo using energy drain on one of its three tendril attacks in a round and instead imbue the touch with the icy coldness of deep space. This attack deals an additional 6d6 points of cold damage and paralyzes the target for 1d4-1 rounds. A successful DC 23 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Vulnerability to Sonic (Su) Neshmaals are native to the noiseless void of deep space or their own alien dimension and, as a result, are especially vulnerable to sonic damage. Magical attacks that cause sonic damage bypass the neshmaal's spell resistance, and they take half again as much damage (+50%) on a failed save (normal full damage on a successful save). If a neshmaal fails a saving throw against an effect that deals sonic damage, it has a 25% chance of being stunned for 1 round."},{"Name":"Set Guardian","CR":"13.00","XP":"25600","Size":"Large","Init":"1","AC":"29, touch 9, flat-footed 27","HP":"151","Fort":"7","Ref":"8","Will":"10","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"unholy weaknesses","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +30 (2d12+9/18-20)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"elemental conduit (ruby), mighty blows, trumpet of doom","AbilitiyScores":"Str 28, Dex 13, Con -, Int -, Wis 17, Cha 21","BaseAtk":"22","CMB":"32","CMD":"43","Source":"AP 84","SpecialAbilities":"Elemental Conduit (Su) Each Set guardian is immune to a specific energy type, and can absorb damage of this type and then discharge it in an intense burst. When a Set guardian would be damaged by the specified energy type, it is instead unharmed. As a free action on the following round, it discharges this energy in a 20-foot radius dealing half again as much damage (150%) as it would have taken from the effect. This discharge occurs even if the Set guardian was destroyed on the previous round. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves this damage. The gemstones in the eye sockets of the Set guardian's headpiece determine the energy type.  Emerald: Set guardians with emerald gemstones are immune to and absorb electricity damage.  Ruby: Set guardians with ruby gemstones are immune to and absorb fire damage.  Sapphire: Set guardians with sapphire gemstones are immune to and absorb cold damage.  Topaz: Set guardians with topaz gemstones are immune to and absorb acid damage.  Another Set guardian that has the same energy type keyed to this ability is unharmed by the damage from this burst, but also doesn't absorb the energy. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Mighty Blows (Ex) A Set guardian's slam attacks score a critical threat on a natural 18-20, and deal double damage on a critical hit. If both slam attacks successfully hit in a single round, the target is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds unless the target makes a successful DC 21 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Trumpet of Doom (Su) Once every 3 rounds as a free action, a Set guardian can emit a sonic blast from its headpiece that deals 2d8+2 points of damage and stuns all creatures within 20 feet of the construct for a single round. A successful DC 21 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stunned condition. Other Set guardians are immune to this effect. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.  Unholy Weaknesses (Ex) Due to the necromantic techniques used in its creation, certain spells and effects affect a Set guardian differently than they otherwise would. A Set guardian is treated as undead for the purposes of spells or effects that deal more damage to undead, like searing light, sunbeam, or sunburst. A Set guardian in the area of effect of positive energy channeled to damage undead is slowed 1 round for every 3d6 points of damage channeled (minimum 1 round). A raise dead spell cast on a Set guardian paralyzes it for 1d4 rounds."},{"Name":"Ammut","CR":"18.00","XP":"153600","Size":"Huge","Init":"10","AC":"34, touch 14, flat-footed 28","HP":"290","Fort":"21","Ref":"20","Will":"13","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"29","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"bite +31 (4d6+19/19-20 plus grab), 2 claws +31 (2d6+13)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.

A creature killed in this way cannot be brought back to life via any effect short of true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but even these spells require the caster to succeed at a caster level check equal to 10 + the targeted creature's Hit Dice. If this check fails, the caster can't attempt to return the targeted creature to life for the next 24 hours (though the caster can try again after this period).  Powerful Jaw (Ex) An ammut's bite attack deals 4d6 points of damage plus one and a half times its Strength bonus. In addition, its reach with this attack is 5 feet further than normal and it gains the grab ability when attacking with its bite.  Swallow Whole (Ex) An ammut can swallow creatures size Large or smaller with this special ability, and can only swallow one creature at a time regardless of the creature's size. In addition, creatures swallowed by an ammut are subject to its wasting curse.  Wasting Curse (Su) Swallow whole-contact; save Will DC 29; frequency 1 hour; effect 1d4 Cha drain.

As a standard action, Ulunat can move over enemies or objects, using its whole body to crush them, dealing 20d6+30 points of damage. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents that are Huge or smaller. This attack affects as many creatures as fit in Ulunat's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless Ulunat moves off them. If Ulunat chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Strength-based.  Devour Magic (Ex) Ulunat has the ability to absorb magic directed at it and create arcane feedback that has the potential to shred a spellcaster's mind. Whenever Ulunat is targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by phantasmal killer. If Ulunat is in the area of effect of a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by insanity. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Hibernation (Ex) Ulunat can sleep for centuries and doesn't need to eat during these periods of dormancy, though it eats ravenously and almost constantly once it has been awakened. If Ulunat is forced into an inhospitable environment, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken. While in hibernation, Ulunat's damage reduction improves to 50/epic and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance as well as all divination effects.  Massive (Ex) Because of Ulunat's size, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to its movement, though forests or settlements are considered difficult terrain. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square Ulunat occupies, and vice versa. Ulunat can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Ulunat gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Ulunat with a successful DC 30 Climb check, however unlike the normal rules regarding Ulunat and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on Ulunat provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.  Regeneration (Ex) Like all Spawn of Rovagug, Ulunat is a nearly indestructible force. No form of attack can suppress Ulunat's regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If Ulunat fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region from devastation, but a method to kill Spawn of Rovagug like Ulunat has yet to be discovered.  Terrible Claws (Ex) Ulunat's natural weapons ignore all forms of damage reduction and hardness.  Tremor Step (Ex) Ulunat's thunderous steps shake the ground as it moves. While moving along the ground, any creatures within 100 feet of Ulunat that are also in contact with the ground must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be knocked prone as the beast thunders along. The save DC is Strength-based."}]

A dimensional shambler under the effects of a dimensional anchor or dimensional lock spell can ignore the effects of the spell for 1 round by making a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check as a move action.  Resist Conjuration (Ex) Dimensional shamblers detest being conjured by other creatures. They are immune to all spell effects of the summoning school, and are treated as if they had double their actual Hit Dice (18 HD for most dimensional shamblers) for the purposes of determining if they can be conjured by spells like planar ally or planar binding.  Shift Planes (Su) A dimensional shambler can shift between planes once per hour, using an effect that is similar to that created by the plane shift spell, save that a dimensional shambler is a master of such travel and can manifest at an exact location on its destination plane if it makes a DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. If it exceeds this DC by 10 or more, it can place itself in such a position upon arrival that if combat immediately results from its appearance, it gains a +10 bonus on its resulting initiative check.  Using shift planes is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, during which the dimensional shambler shimmers and grows increasingly transparent.  A dimensional shambler can use this ability while grappling a creature-doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity from the creature it is grappling. If the creature is of the dimensional shambler's size or smaller (Medium for most dimensional shamblers), that creature shifts planes with the dimensional shambler unless it makes a DC 15 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based."},{"Name":"Spawning Canker","CR":"9.00","XP":"6400","Size":"Medium","Init":"6","AC":"23, touch 17, flat-footed 16","HP":"115","Fort":"12","Ref":"11","Will":"9","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +15 (1d6+8), tentacle +10 (1d8+4 plus grab)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"constrict (1d8+4), feeding","AbilitiyScores":"Str 26, Dex 23, Con 24, Int 7, Wis 14, Cha 17","BaseAtk":"7","CMB":"15","CMD":"32","Source":"AP 46","SpecialAbilities":"Feeding (Ex) Whenever a spawning canker deals damage to a sentient living creature with its constrict attack, it also deals 1d3 points of Charisma damage as it feeds off the victim's vital essence. If a spawning canker drains 10 points of Charisma in 1 hour, the canker immediately spawns (see below). Spawn (Ex) When a spawning canker has drained enough life force, it bursts apart into 2d4+2 slugspawn. These wormlike terrors crawl into nearby shadows and lurk in wait for any potential hosts to come nearby. The spawning canker is destroyed when this occurs. There is a 1% chance that instead of turning into slugspawn, a spawning canker transforms into a dark young of Shub-Niggurath (see page 78)."},{"Name":"Gnoph-Keh","CR":"11.00","XP":"12800","Size":"Large","Init":"1","AC":"25, touch 10, flat-footed 24","HP":"147","Fort":"14","Ref":"12","Will":"11","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"heat susceptible, vulnerable to fire","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"4 claws +20 (1d6+7), gore +20 (1d8+7/19-20/x3)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"blizzard, powerful charge (gore, 2d8+14/ 19-20/x3)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 24, Dex 13, Con 20, Int 13, Wis 20, Cha 21","BaseAtk":"14","CMB":"22","CMD":"33 (41 vs. trip)","Source":"AP 46","SpecialAbilities":"Blizzard (Su) Once per hour as a standard action, a gnoph-keh can create a stationary blizzard that fills a 20-foot-radius spread. The gnoph-keh can place the center of this blizzard at any point within its reach. Multiple gnoph-kehs can use the aid another action to help a single gnoph-keh create a much larger blizzard-every additional gnoph-keh who aids the first increases the area of the blizzard's radius by 20 feet. All gnoph-kehs wishing to aid the primary creature must be within the area of that gnoph-keh's cold aura.  Once created, the blizzard remains active for 1 hour if it was created in a cold environment, or for 1 minute if created anywhere else. The wind in the blizzard's area blows in a clockwise circular pattern at windstorm speeds, restricts visibility as fog does, and makes the region count as difficult terrain. A gnoph-keh can move through a blizzard (either one created by magic or a naturally occurring blizzard) without penalty.  Cold Aura (Su) A gnoph-keh radiates an aura of blistering cold in a 30-foot radius. Any creature that ends its turn within this area takes 2d6 points of cold damage. While in a blizzard (either one created by magic, such as the gnoph-keh's blizzard power, or a naturally occurring blizzard), any creature that takes damage from a gnoph-keh's cold aura must make a DC 22 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered by the numbing cold for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Heat Susceptible (Ex) A gnoph-keh takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made to resist the effects of high temperatures (see page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). When a gnoph-keh takes damage from heat in this way, and the damage is from temperatures in excess of 90ï¿½ F, the damage the creature takes is always lethal damage. In these conditions, the gnoph-keh's cold aura does not function at all.  Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the gnoph-keh climbs must be icy. The beast can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A gnoph-keh can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow."},{"Name":"Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath","CR":"12.00","XP":"19200","Size":"Huge","Init":"7","AC":"27, touch 11, flat-footed 24","HP":"161","Fort":"11","Ref":"9","Will":"0","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"4 tentacles +19 (1d8+10/19-20 plus grab)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"constrict (1d8+10), sucking maws, trample (1d8+15, DC 27)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 30, Dex 17, Con 24, Int 16, Wis 19, Cha 21","BaseAtk":"10","CMB":"+1 (+5 grapple)","CMD":"13 (can't be tripped)","Source":"AP 46","SpecialAbilities":"Sucking Maws (Su) A dark young of Shub-Niggurath that successfully pins a creature it is grappling automatically inflicts 1d4 points of Strength drain on that creature. A DC 24 Fortitude save reduces this effect to 1 point of Strength drain. A creature drained to 0 Strength does not die, but must make a DC 24 Will save at that point to resist being driven mad by the experience, as the foul green waste exuded from the same sucking mouths that drink life implant in the emptied shells strange visions and horrifying certainties. If you use the GameMastery Guide in your game, this madness manifests as schizophrenia, but with a save DC equal to the dark young's Strength drain save DC listed above (DC 24 for most dark young). One common result of this unfortunate madness is a strange desire to return to the site of their original encounter in hopes of being consumed entirely by the creature that only drank a part of their body and mind-many of those who survive this horrific ordeal go on to found dark young cults of their own. If you don't use the GameMastery Guide in your game, treat this madness instead as an insanity spell. The madness element of a dark young's sucking maws is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC for all of the saving throws involved with this special ability is Constitution-based."}]

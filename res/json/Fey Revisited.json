Creatures within 10 feet of a sprite swarm with line of sight must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is dazzled for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Concentrated Rush (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, if more than one creature occupies a sprite swarm's space, the swarm may use its attack action to concentrate on one of these creatures to deal 4d6 points of damage in place of its normal swarm damage. Other creatures within the horde's space do not take swarm damage that round.  Mob Mentality (Ex) As long as a sprite swarm has at least 10 hit points, it retains its Intelligence score and can act accordingly. Even so, it cannot be targeted by mind-affecting spells or effects that target a single creature. If its hit points fall below 10, the swarm is considered mindless as the individual creatures within begin to panic."},{"Name":"Blackwood Satyr","CR":"7.00","XP":"3200","Size":"Medium","Init":"5","AC":"20, touch 16, flat-footed 14","HP":"83","Fort":"6","Ref":"11","Will":"9","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"dagger +6 (1d4+2/19-20), horns +1 (1d6+1)","Ranged":"#ERROR!","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"pipes (DC 19)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 15, Dex 20, Con 17, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 21","BaseAtk":"4","CMB":"6","CMD":"22","Source":"Fey Revisited","SpecialAbilities":"Incorrigible Charm (Su) A blackwood satyr emits an aura of incorrigible charm out to a radius of 30 feet. Any creature that begins its turn in this area of effect must succeed at a DC 19 Will save, or be affected as per the spell charm person. The blackwood satyr can suppress or resume this ability at will. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Pipes (Su) A blackwood satyr can focus and empower his magical abilities by playing haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot radius must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected by charm monster, deep slumber, reckless infatuation, or suggestion, depending on what tune the satyr chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes' effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the blackwood satyr's other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use of his pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spell-like abilities, and if separated from them, he may continue to use his standard abilities. The pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based."}]

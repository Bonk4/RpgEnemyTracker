While they still cannot use the spells to transform into specific individuals, they can control the skin tone, the hair color, the general body shape, and even the gender of the creature they transform into, granting them a +20 bonus on Disguise checks instead of the usual +10. This is a free action made as part of the spellcasting.  Rune Mastery (Ex) Raelises are masters of all magic based on runes or symbols. They automatically add explosive runes, glyph of warding, greater glyph of warding, sepia snake sigil, and all symbol spells to their list of spells known and increase the DC for these spells by 1. Additionally, raelises are immune to magical traps and effects that utilize runes or symbols, such as sepia snake sigil and explosive runes.  Spells A raelis casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. It has no sorcerer bloodline and does not gain any other sorcerer class abilities.  Stun (Ex) A raelis's iron-hard fist delivers a powerful, stunning blow. A creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit and the target fails its save, the creature is instead stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.  Word Caller (Su) Raelises automatically sense the presence and basic topic of any books, scrolls, or other writings within 50 feet. By spending a standard action, they gain a deeper understanding of the text, treating up to 100 pages of nonmagical writing as if they had read it, or treating one magical spell or scroll as if they had read it and successfully made a successful Spellcraft check to understand it."},{"Name":"Living Rune","CR":"13.00","XP":"25600","Size":"Medium","Init":"15","AC":"28, touch 28, flat-footed 16","HP":"153","Fort":"10","Ref":"17","Will":"15","DefensiveAbilities":"amorphous","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerable to sonic","Speed":"50 ft., climb 50 ft.","Melee":"glyph touch +24 touch (3d8 electricity)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"0 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"symbols of power","AbilitiyScores":"Str -, Dex 32, Con 18, Int 15, Wis 14, Cha 20","BaseAtk":"13","CMB":"13","CMD":"41 (can't be tripped)","Source":"AP 66","SpecialAbilities":"Camouflage (Ex) A living rune is able to shift its coloration and form to blend into its surroundings. The creature automatically hits with its touch attack against any creature that fails to notice it and enters its square.  Glyph Touch (Su) A living rune deals 3d8 points of electricity damage with a successful touch attack, and it uses its Dexterity modifier (instead of its Strength modifier) to resolve all touch attacks.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) A living rune is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain other spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  � An erase spell deals 6d6 points of damage to a living rune.  � A living rune caught in the radius of any symbol spell is immune to its effects and heals 1d8 points of damage per spell level. Hit points beyond its total maximum are gained as temporary hit points that fade in 1 hour.  � A living rune is affected normally by magic missile, maze, and spells that deal sonic damage.  Symbols of Power (Su) As a standard action, a living rune can shift its form into a number of powerful symbols whose effects can damage or incapacitate opponents. Each round the living rune can choose a new effect, but a particular symbol form can only be used once every 4 rounds. This attack is resolved with a touch attack and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Fear: The target becomes panicked for 2d6 rounds (Will DC 24).  Pain: The target suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 hour (Fort DC 24).  Persuasion: The target is charmed by the living rune (as charm monster) for 2d6 hours (Will DC 24).  Slow: The target is slowed (as the slow spell) for 12 rounds (Will DC 24).  Stunning: The target is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Fort DC 24).  Weakness: The target suffers crippling weakness that deals 2d6 points of Strength damage (Fort DC 24).  Truescript (Su) A living rune can sculpt its form into complicated scripts and pictographs that can be understood by any creature with the ability to read written language. A living rune can also understand any written or spoken language.  Two-Dimensional (Ex) A living rune only exists in two dimensions, and has some qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A living rune has no Strength score. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as jumping or flying), and can only navigate along solid surfaces such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can only attack creatures by entering their squares and touching them directly. A living rune can crawl onto solid surfaces that can then themselves be moved (such as onto a tome via its telekinesis spell-like ability). It cannot fall or take falling damage, cannot make trip or grapple attacks, and cannot be tripped or grappled. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the opponent's equipment, has no weight, and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight. A living rune takes no damage from nonmagical attacks and only takes half damage from magical weapons."},{"Name":"Mezlan","CR":"14.00","XP":"38400","Size":"Medium","Init":"11","AC":"30, touch 18, flat-footed 22","HP":"195","Fort":"12","Ref":"14","Will":"11","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"25","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft., climb 20 ft., swim 20 ft.","Melee":"2 morphic weapons +22 (2d8+10)","Ranged":"morphic weapon +19 (2d8+10)","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.

The mezlan's creature type doesn't change in this new form and it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities; the transformation is cosmetic only. In these other forms, the mezlan retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as depicted above. Though this ability only affects the mezlan's outward image, it is a transmutation effect.  Morphic Weapons (Ex) A mezlan can manipulate its body to mimic a wide array of potent weaponry wielded by its various forms. While the weapons may look different, they are considered natural weapons and they all do the same amount of damage; are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction; and deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once per round, a mezlan can extend one of its limbs to strike at a distance up to 15 feet away with one of its slam attacks. Also, while mimicking a creature wielding a ranged weapon, a mezlan can fire a portion of its body as if the fragment were a projectile. This projectile is treated as a thrown weapon and has a range increment of 60 feet.  Skill Pool (Ex) A mezlan has a special knack for solving problems. Five times per day, it can apply a +4 competence bonus on any skill check, even checks for skills it has no ranks in or skills that can only be used untrained.  Spell Battery (Su) A mezlan can store up to 10 levels of spells that it can then cast freely. The spells imbued into a mezlan are each activated with the casting time for the relevant spell and are cast at the caster level of the spellcaster who provided the spells. A mezlan can store and use both divine and arcane spells, and can be imbued by any number of casters at a time. To fuel this ability, a caster must cast her spells into the mezlan; alternatively, the spellcaster can use a scroll to place a spell into the mezlan. A mezlan must voluntarily lower its spell resistance in order to be imbued with spells.  In addition, a mezlan can choose to lower its spell resistance and absorb spells cast at it. The mezlan must be aware of the incoming spell and ready an action to absorb it. Only spells that have the mezlan as a target can be absorbed in this way; area spells are not absorbed. If a mezlan already possesses 10 levels of spells, it cannot absorb more. The mezlan can use these absorbed spells as its own.  Versatile Speech (Ex) A mezlan has a talent for parsing spoken languages. After spending 1 minute listening to a speaker use a language it doesn't already know, a mezlan can understand that language. After listening for 1 additional minute, the mezlan can speak the language. This understanding lasts for 24 hours before fading from the mezlan's mutable mind. To understand the same language again after this time, the mezlan must spend another minute listening to a creature speak that language. The mezlan doesn't have to be engaged in a conversation to use this ability."}]

Its DR in this form increases to 20/epic, and its aura of blazing courage's radius increases to 1,000 feet. While in this form, it can't attack.  Aura of Blazing Courage (Su) A gold colossus constantly radiates a warm aura of bravery. Allies within 30 feet of a gold colossus gain the benefits of bless and remove fear.  Blessing of the Gilded Host (Su) Once per week, a gold colossus can bless an army using the rules for mass combat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 234), granting the army a +2 bonus to its Offensive Modifier and on Morale checks until the end of its next battle or for 1 week, whichever comes first.  Selective Antimagic Aura (Su) Spells with the compulsion or teleportation descriptor are unaffected by this field.  Suppressing Stomp (Su) Whenever a gold colossus deals stomp damage to a target, it reduces the target's damage reduction and spell resistance by 2 for 1 minute.  Each stomp thereafter increases the reduction by 2 (maximum reduction of 10) and resets the duration."}]

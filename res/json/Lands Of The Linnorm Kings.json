A DC 36 Reflex save halves the fire damage dealt. The save DC is Constitution-based. This wind has two additional effects as well.  Deafening: Any creature in the area of effect that does not succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save is deafened by the thunderous wind.  Storm-Laced: The closest creature to Fafnheir in the area of effect is also blasted by a bolt of lightning and takes 20d6 points of electricity damage in addition to the fire damage dealt. This creature can make a second DC 36 Reflex save to halve this electricity damage.  Tornado Force: The winds themselves gust at nearly 300 miles per hour, affecting all creatures in the area of effect as if they were caught in tornado-force winds. The wind lasts only a few moments during Fafnheir's action, so it has no real effect on ranged attacks, but it blows away any Large or smaller creature (or Huge or smaller flying creature) that fails a DC 15 Strength check.  Death Curse (Su) Fafnheir is a difficult creature to slay, especially since he lives on in the body of any creature that slays him. When a creature slays Fafnheir, it becomes afflicted by the Curse of Fafnheir.  Curse of Fafnheir: save Will DC 32; effect creature's sense of self erodes as its personality is slowly replaced by Fafnheir's-this manifests as 1d6 points of Charisma drain every 24 hours. A target whose Charisma drops to 0 becomes comatose and must immediately make a DC 32 Fortitude save or die; every 24 hours that passes thereafter, the victim must make a new Fortitude save to avoid death (unless its Charisma score rises above 0, at which point it takes 1d6 points of Charisma drain). If a creature dies from the effects of this curse, its body explodes in a 60-foot burst of burning wind, with effects identical to Fafnheir's breath weapon. This effect occurs if the cursed victim dies from any effect, not just from the curse. One round later, Fafnheir gains the effect of a true resurrection spell, appearing at the same spot where the cursed victim died (or the closest area large enough to contain the Colossal creature), with full memories of the cursed victim's doings and accomplishments while cursed. The only way to permanently slay Fafnheir is to avoid becoming cursed after killing him, or to remove the curse before the victim dies. The effects of this curse end prematurely and immediately if Fafnheir is restored to life by other means. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Freedom of Movement (Ex) Fafnheir is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.  Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 34; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 10d6 fire damage and 1d4 drain from each ability score; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.  True Seeing (Ex) Fafnheir has true seeing, as the spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled."}]

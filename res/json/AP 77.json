As a standard action, a stringy demodand can use its growths to entangle any adjacent creatures of its size or smaller. To resist being entangled, a target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save. As long as the stringy demodand is entangling one or more creatures, any creature that moves adjacent to the demodand must successfully save or likewise be entangled. Entangled creatures can't move farther than 5 feet from the stringy demodand until they break free from its growths. An entangled creature can break free as a move  action by succeeding at a DC 25 Strength or Escape Artist check. The save DCs are Constitution-based."},{"Name":"Labyrinth Minotaur","CR":"16.00","XP":"76800","Size":"Large","Init":"4","AC":"29, touch 13, flat-footed 29","HP":"232","Fort":"19","Ref":"9","Will":"17","DefensiveAbilities":"natural cunning","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"#ERROR!","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"bronze mask, powerful charge (gore, 2d8+16), steel-shod hooves, trample (2d6+16, DC 28)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 33, Dex 19, Con 30, Int 17, Wis 26, Cha 14","BaseAtk":"15","CMB":"+27 (+31 bull rush)","CMD":"41 (43 vs. bull rush)","Source":"AP 77","SpecialAbilities":"Bronze Mask (Su) A labyrinth minotaur draws agility and ferocity from its bronze mask. When it makes a full-attack action, a labyrinth minotaur wearing its bronze mask can give up its regular attacks and instead make one gore attack or bull rush against each opponent within reach. It must make a separate attack roll against each opponent, and it can't choose to move with targets that are pushed back. A labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. If a labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask is stolen or destroyed, it can create a replacement with 1 week of work.  Natural Cunning (Ex) Like a normal minotaur, a labyrinth minotaur possesses innate cunning and logical ability, granting it immunity to maze spells and preventing it from ever becoming lost. Further, a labyrinth minotaur is never caught flat-footed.  Steel-Shod Hooves (Ex) A labyrinth minotaur's steel-shod hooves are particularly devastating when used to trample an opponent. A creature that takes full damage from a labyrinth minotaur's trample ability (because the creature either failed its Reflex save or chose to take an attack of opportunity instead of attempting a Reflex save) is knocked prone and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equal to that of the labyrinth minotaur's trample ability) reduces the duration of the staggered condition to 1 round."},{"Name":"Vilsteth","CR":"16.00","XP":"76800","Size":"Medium","Init":"8","AC":"30, touch 14, flat-footed 26","HP":"225","Fort":"18","Ref":"10","Will":"14","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"27","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +24 (2d6+6), gore +24 (2d6+6 plus 1d4 Wis), tail slap +19 (1d8+3)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"idolatry, labyrinthine mindtrap, mindrender, powerful charge (gore, 4d6+12), rend (2 claws, 2d6+9), unspeakable truth","AbilitiyScores":"Str 22, Dex 19, Con 24, Int 23, Wis 16, Cha 23","BaseAtk":"18","CMB":"24","CMD":"38","Source":"AP 77","SpecialAbilities":"Idolatry (Su) When a vilsteth uses enter image, meld into stone, possess object, or statue to assume the appearance of a public or religious monument (either by entering or controlling an existing object or by taking the semblance of one), it can make itself an object of worship and adoration. This functions as sympathy (DC 25, CL 18th) upon either a single creature within 30 feet or all creatures of the chosen type or alignment within 30 feet. Any creature that fails its saving throw against this effect must attempt an additional DC 25 Will save after spending 24 hours within 30 feet of the object of worship. If the targeted creature fails this second save, it's affected as if under a permanent mind fog effect with respect to the vilsteth. This is a curse effect and cannot be dispelled (although dispel chaos or dispel evil can remove this effect, as does break enchantment).  Labyrinthine Mindtrap (Su) Whenever a vilsteth is targeted with a divination or mind-affecting effect, including effects that simply facilitate mental communication, the caster's mind is entrapped within the twisted corridors and pathways of the vilsteth's intellect, causing the caster to become dazed (Will DC 25 negates). Each round on the victim's turn, it can attempt a new saving throw to escape this mind trap, ending its turn, but each failed save deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain to the creature. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the same vilsteth's labyrinthine mindtrap for 24 hours.  Mindrender (Su) When a vilsteth hits with both claw attacks and rends its target, it gains a +4 profane bonus on its gore attack for that turn. In addition, if the vilsteth's gore attack hits, the target is affected by the vilsteth's labyrinthine mindtrap ability, even if the targeted creature already successfully saved against that ability in the last 24 hours.  Unspeakable Truth (Su) A vilsteth is surrounded by a mantle of misinformation. Creatures within 30 feet are affected by a curse that manifests the next time they attempt to share information about the vilsteth, including things they have observed the demon saying or doing. This curse affects the creature as fumbletongueUM (Will DC 25 negates). A successful save negates the curse, but if the target fails the save, this curse manifests every time that target attempts to talk about the vilsteth. This curse is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and can't be dispelled or suppressed with protection from evil. A vilsteth can order creatures affected by charm or compulsion effects that it creates to share information about it without triggering the curse."},{"Name":"Baphomet","CR":"27.00","XP":"3276800","Size":"Large","Init":"23","AC":"45, touch 34, flat-footed 45","HP":"643","Fort":"36","Ref":"26","Will":"31","DefensiveAbilities":"Abyssal resurrection, freedom of movement, supernatural cunning","SR":"38","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"50 ft., fly 50 ft.

This blade is made of ivory, but is razor sharp and as hard as adamantine (and possesses all the qualities of that material). It is a +5 lawful-outsider-bane unholy wounding glaive capable of inflicting particularly horrible and painful wounds on good-aligned targets and devils alike. Such a creature must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save each time it's wounded by Aizerghaul or be sickened with pain for as long as the damage caused by the wound persists. Whether the save succeeds or fails, these wounds don't heal naturally and resist magical healing. A character attempting to heal these wounds must succeed at a DC 32 caster level check or the healing has no effect on the injured creature.  Glaive Mastery (Ex) Baphomet is exceptionally skilled at fighting with a glaive. He is treated as a 20th-level fighter for the purposes of fulfilling any feat prerequisites, such as that for Weapon Specialization.  Infernal Brand (Su) The mark of Asmodeus is branded on Baphomet's brow, yet this is no mark of fealty or servitude. Rather, Baphomet has claimed the pentagram-a remnant of the time he spend as the archdevil's prisoner-and now draws power from it. The brand grants him his devil-like abilities of fire immunity and see in darkness. In addition, all devils and worshipers of devils take a -2 penalty on saving throws against Baphomet's special attacks and spell-like abilities. He gains a +4 bonus on caster level checks to penetrate a devil's spell resistance, and automatically penetrates a devil's damage reduction with his glaive and natural attacks.  Language Mastery (Ex) Baphomet can speak, read, and understand all languages.  Scroll Use (Ex) Baphomet can cast spells from any scroll as if he possessed the spell on a spell list. Spells he casts from scrolls always resolve at caster level 27th.  Summon Minotaurs (Sp) Baphomet can summon half-fiend minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs (see page 90), and mythic minotaurs as if casting a summon monster spell. He can summon eight half-fiend minotaurs three times per day, and four mythic minotaurs or one labyrinth minotaur once per day. This ability functions as a swift action, but otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule with 100% chance of success and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.  Supernatural Cunning (Su) Baphomet is never caught flat-footed and gains a +8 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, he's immune to maze spells and can never become lost. He always knows the shortest, most direct route through any maze. After spending 1 minute in any maze, he understands its entire layout implicitly and can teleport to any location using his greater teleport spell-like ability."}]

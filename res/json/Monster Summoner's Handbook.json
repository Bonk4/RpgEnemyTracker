Any living or dead creature within 300 feet with line of sight to the dancing embers must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or else any protections or immunities it has against charm, fear, and mind-affecting effects are suppressed for as long as the ember weaver uses a free action to maintain the effect each round and for 1 round thereafter. Once a creature succeeds at this saving throw, it can't be affected by an eerie radiance for 24 hours. The light has no effect on psychopomps, creatures that can't see, and creatures the ember weaver chooses to exclude. This is a sight-based abjuration effect.  Rush of Souls (Su) As a standard action every 1d4+1 rounds, an ember weaver can call forth a rush of souls to trample its foes. This ability deals 6d6 points of force damage to all creatures in a 60-foot cone. A successful DC 19 Reflex saving throw halves the damage. The save DC is Charisma-based."}]

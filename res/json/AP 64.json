A kere who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded grave immediately becomes visible and unable to use any of her spell-like abilities. A kere who is out of range of her bonded grave for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day of separation that follows-eventually, this separation kills the kere. A kere can break this bond or forge a new bond with a new grave by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 Will save. If a kere is not bonded with a grave, she must either actively try to forge a new bond or attempt to return to the Boneyard (where she takes no penalties from not being bonded).  Grave Meld (Su) A kere can meld with any gravestone or funerary sculpture, similarly to how the spell meld into stone functions. She can remain melded with such a structure as long as she wishes.  Grave Tell (Sp) This ability functions as the spell stone tell, but only affects stone funerary structures, like gravestones, cemetery monuments, lych-gates, mausoleums, and similar constructions.  Infectious Fear (Su) Any creature struck by a kere's shroud must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. Any creature that physically touches a creature frightened by this effect must succeed at a DC 20 Will save as well or also be frightened for 2d4 rounds (though the fear of the creature touched is not contagious). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Shroud (Ex) A kere's shroud is an insubstantial thing that only a kere can touch. Creatures that come into contact with this shroud find it to be as insubstantial as mist-though they often do feel the terror it inspires. A creature that is unaware of a kere and is struck by her shroud is not aware that a weapon has struck it. A kere's shroud vaporizes upon its owner's death.  Spiritsense (Su) A psychopomp notices, locates, and can distinguish between living and undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if she possessed the blindsight ability.  Spirit Touch (Ex) A psychopomp's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had the ghost touch weapon special ability.  Veil of Tears (Su) Any graveyard that hosts a kere is gloomier and more solemn. All exterior areas within such a graveyard are perpetually affected by darkness and mind fog (Will DC 20). Additionally, any undead creature that enters the area is also affected as per the spell slow (Will DC 20). Those who save against these effects are immune to the graveyard's veil of tears for the next 24 hours. Those who fail are affected by these penalties for as long as they remain in the graveyard. A veil of tears can be raised or lowered by the resident kere as a free action. The veil disperses if a kere leaves the graveyard or is destroyed, and rises upon her return. The veil can also be dispelled for 1 day by casting dispel magic or a similar spell upon the kere's bonded gravestone. The spell effects are cast at the kere's caster level (usually 11th). The saving throw DCs are based on the resident kere's Charisma."},{"Name":"Gongorinan","CR":"11.00","XP":"12800","Size":"Medium","Init":"10","AC":"27, touch 17, flat-footed 20","HP":"137","Fort":"14","Ref":"13","Will":"7","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"22","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft., climb 40 ft.","Melee":"#ERROR!","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"bleed (1d6), constrict (1d6+7), oviposition, web (+17 ranged, DC 22, 11 hp)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 23, Dex 23, Con 24, Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 20","BaseAtk":"11","CMB":"+17 (+21 grapple)","CMD":"34 (42 vs. trip)","Source":"AP 64","SpecialAbilities":"Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to a gongorinan's horrific appearance become confused for 1d4 rounds.  Oviposition (Su) A gongorinan can implant a stony egg the size of a human heart in the body of any Small or larger pinned, helpless, or willing creature as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This action deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to the victim. If the victim survives this damage, the egg takes root deep in the victim's body, links to his mind, and begins gestating. The egg grows rapidly, dealing 1 point of Intelligence drain every day to a minimum score of 1. Once this Intelligence drain affects a creature that already has an effective Intelligence score of 1, the egg \"hatches\" inside of the victim. This causes the victim to immediately transform into a horrid animal, aberration, magical beast, or vermin (the exact choice is made by the gongorinan according to its strange goals and unknowable desires), whereupon it begins living out its new life via pure instinct-this effect otherwise functions as if it were baleful polymorph to which the creature had failed its secondary Will save to retain its personality. A gongorinan can command the actions of a creature that has undergone this transformation as if the victim had been affected by dominate monster (this works even on creatures that are normally immune to such effects as a result of being mindless) as long as the gongorinan is within 120 feet of the creature. The effect can be reversed by break enchantment (DC 22-treat the gongorinan's Hit Dice as it caster level), but cannot be dispelled.  Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Strength damage and staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based."},{"Name":"End's Voice","CR":"15.00","XP":"51200","Size":"Large","Init":"7","AC":"31, touch 15, flat-footed 27","HP":"225","Fort":"18","Ref":"11","Will":"19","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"26","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft., fly 40 ft.

Contact Other Plane (Sp) This ability functions as the spell contact other plane, but the herald can only ask questions on the behalf of another creature, the questioner (not the herald) must make the Intelligence check (if any) to avoid losing Intelligence or Charisma, and the loss is permanent rather than temporary.  Destructive Aura (Su) As a swift action, the herald can emit a 30-foot aura of destruction for 15 rounds per day. All attacks made against targets in this aura (including the herald) gain a +7 morale bonus on damage rolls, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.  Maddening Strike (Su) If the herald successfully hits a creature with its flail, as a swift action it may force the opponent to make a DC 25 Will save. If the creature fails its save, it is confused for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Madness (Ex) The herald uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier, and is immune to insanity and confusion effects. Only a miracle or wish can remove its madness. If this occurs, the herald gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma; it automatically reverts to its insane state 1d10 minutes later.  Telepathic Bond (Sp) This ability functions like telepathic bond, except any creature linked to the herald's disturbing thoughts takes 1 point of Wisdom damage every 10 minutes."},{"Name":"Yamasoth","CR":"24.00","XP":"1228800","Size":"Gargantuan","Init":"11","AC":"43, touch 18, flat-footed 35","HP":"526","Fort":"33","Ref":"28","Will":"18","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"35","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., fly 60 ft.

This gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet, and polymorphs creatures affected by it into giant vermin, animals, or magical beasts (Fortitude DC 37 resists). Yamasoth chooses what creatures to transform victims into as they fail their saving throws. This effect otherwise functions as polymorph any object (CL 20th), and is a polymorph effect. Yamasoth can keep his maw open for up to 3 consecutive rounds, after which his throat-eye closes and this gaze weapon cannot be used again for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to Yamasoth's horrific appearance are stunned. At the start of each round thereafter, a creature stunned in this way can make a choice- fight the overwhelming chaos and horror and attempt a new DC 29 Will save to end the stun effect and act normally on that round, or accept the chaos into its soul and automatically succeed at the save to recover from the stun effect. This latter option immediately shifts the creature's alignment one step closer to chaotic evil. This shift in alignment can be fixed via atonement, but counts as a voluntary alignment shift for the purposes of atonement's material component requirements. A creature that becomes chaotic evil as a result of this also becomes a willing minion and ally of Yamasoth.  Maw (Ex) Yamasoth's central maw is a primary attack that threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A creature hit by Yamasoth's maw while his gaze weapon is active takes a -4 penalty on its next saving throw against the gaze attack.  Polymorph Plague (Su) Any creature that has been affected by one of Yamasoth's polymorph effects becomes \"contagious.\" For 24 hours after the creature's initial transformation, any other creature that touches or is touched by the polymorphed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the polymorphed creature's HD + the polymorphed creature's Constitution modifier) to resist polymorphing into a creature identical to the current form of the polymorphed creature.  Qlippoth Lord Traits A qlippoth lord is a powerful and unique qlippoth that rules a significant portion of an Abyssal realm. Qlippoth lords possess the following traits.  � Immunity to cold, death effects, mind-affecting effects, and poison.  � Resistance to acid 30, electricity 30, and fire 30.  � Horrific Appearance (Su) This ability functions similarly to the typical qlippoth ability, save that qlippoth lords' horrific appearances often create physical effects and changes in their victims. Despite these physical effects, a qlippoth lord's horrific appearance remains a mind-affecting effect.  � Summon Qlippoth (Sp) Once per day, a qlippoth lord can summon any qlippoth or combination of qlippoth whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.  � Telepathy 300 feet.  � A qlippoth lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  � Qlippoth lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the qlippoth lord's behalf. All qlippoth lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil; in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to each qlippoth lord's themes and interests.  Tentacle Transformation (Su) At the start of every odd-numbered round, three of Yamasoth's tentacle tips transform into one of three different types of appendages-a serpent's head, a clawed hand, or a metallic blade. The three tentacles all change into the same type of attack, and the change persists for 1 full round, after which the three tentacles revert to normal tentacles on every even-numbered round. While transformed, the limbs make the following types of attacks instead of tentacle attacks.  � Blade: talon +36 (3d6+13/19-20)  � Clawed Hand: claw +36 (2d6+13 plus bleed damage equal to the damage dealt by the claw)  � Serpent Head: bite +36 (1d8+13 plus poison: bite- injury; save Fort DC 37; frequency 1/round for 12 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex drain and slowed for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive saves)"}]

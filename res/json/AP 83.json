In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature.  � Dominate animal causes a hanshepsu to become confused for 1d4 rounds.  � Hold animal slows a hanshepsu (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds. While slowed, a hanshepsu can't change its animal head with its morphic head ability.  � Soften earth and stone cast directly at a hanshepsu deals 5d10 points of damage (no save).  Morphic Head (Su) As a move action, a hanshepsu can transform its head from one animal form to another. Each animal head grants a hanshepsu different abilities.  Cat: The hanshepsu gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks, and it always counts as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump.  Cobra: The hanshepsu can spit a stream of venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Any opponent hit by this attack succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage for 2 rounds. This is a poison effect.  Crocodile: The hanshepsu's mace grows teeth and deals an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage with each successful attack.  Hawk: The hanshepsu gains a +8 racial bonus on Perception checks, and all penalties to Perception based on distance are halved.  Hippopotamus: The hanshepsu's damage reduction increases to DR 15/- and it gains a +4 bonus against combat maneuvers and effects that attempt to move it.  Ibis: The hanshepsu can use feather fall at will as a spell-like ability and can fly for up to 5 minutes each day.  Scarab: The hanshepsu's damage reduction is not subject to the effects of a golembane scarab or any abilities that allow a creature to ignore a construct's damage reduction.  Scorpion: The hanshepsu gains a climb speed of 20 feet and its mace gains the speedUE weapon special ability for 1 minute each day.  Set Beast: The hanshepsu's mace deals an additional 1d6 points of negative energy damage with each successful attack.  Solar Disk: A hanshepsu can change its head into a single non-animal form: that of a solar disk. In this form, a hanshepsu becomes immobile and heals itself at a rate of 5 hit points per hour.  Vulture: Each time a creature is struck by the hanshepsu's mace, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or contract bubonic plague (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557).  Soldier's Training (Ex) A hanshepsu has Weapon Specialization (heavy mace) despite not being a 4th-level fighter.  Warrior's Mace (Su) A hanshepsu's mace is treated as a +1 weapon, and the hanshepsu can deal nonlethal damage with the mace without taking a penalty. The mace is permanently affixed to the hanshepsu's hand during creation so it can't be disarmed; it can, however, be sundered. If the mace is destroyed, a hanshepsu can make 1 slam attack per round that deals 1d8+7 points of damage."},{"Name":"Living Sandstorm","CR":"11.00","XP":"12800","Size":"Medium","Init":"6","AC":"26, touch 17, flat-footed 19","HP":"147","Fort":"9","Ref":"15","Will":"12","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., burrow 30 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +24 (1d8+10 plus distraction)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"distraction (DC 22), slashing sand","AbilitiyScores":"Str 31, Dex 22, Con 21, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 13","BaseAtk":"14","CMB":"+24 (+26 sunder)","CMD":"41 (43 vs. sunder)","Source":"AP 83","SpecialAbilities":"Change Shape (Su) A living sandstorm can shift between its humanoid form, shaped from packed sand, and a sandstorm form as a standard action. In sandstorm form, a living sandstorm functions as if it were a swarm of Fine creatures with a hive mind, and it loses its burrow speed, slam attacks, and compression abilities, but gains a fly speed and the ability to use its create sand and sand blast abilities. Its Strength score is reduced to 1, but its ability scores are otherwise unchanged. A living sandstorm remains in one form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form can't be dispelled, nor does the living sandstorm revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.  Sandsight (Ex) The living sandstorm can see through sand, dust, and other particles in the air as if the air were clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.  Slashing Sand (Ex) A living sandstorm's swarm attack deals slashing damage. Its slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage."},{"Name":"Living Sandstorm","CR":"11.00","XP":"12800","Size":"Fine","Init":"6","AC":"34, touch 25, flat-footed 27","HP":"147","Fort":"9","Ref":"15","Will":"12","DefensiveAbilities":"swarm traits","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., fly 60 ft.

All creatures in the area and adjacent squares must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Medium and smaller creatures in the area are buried and must begin holding their breath to avoid drowning in the sand. By attempting a Reflex save against the same DC, a creature can avoid being buried if there is an adjacent space outside the area to which it can move; if the save is successful, the creature is moved into an available adjacent space. As a standard action, each buried creature can dig itself out or be dug out by another with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Invisible creatures in or adjacent to the area when the sand is created are outlined until the dust is removed. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Sand Blast (Ex) When in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can attack with a blast of scouring sand in a 20-foot line. The sand deals 6d6 points of slashing damage and blinds creatures in the area for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the blinding.

Any creature attempting to contact an elder sphinx's mind or read its thoughts with a divination spell or similar ability must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be overwhelmed by the chaos and vast scope of the knowledge within. Those who fail are affected by feeblemind. An elder sphinx can willingly suppress this ability at will as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Enigma (Su) Elder sphinxes have removed themselves from the mundane world to contemplate the mysteries of the universe-and beyond. To facilitate this, they possess an uncanny ability to elude detection and discovery by those that could possibly interrupt their meditations. Any creature (other than another sphinx), that leaves line of sight of an elder sphinx for more than 1 hour must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be unable to recall details of the encounter, as if the sphinx cast modify memory to eliminate all recollection of itself. The exact details of this memory loss are decided by the elder sphinx subconsciously during the encounter and it may eliminate up to an hour of memories. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Litany of Riddles (Su) As a standard action, an elder sphinx can telepathically project a befuddling series of riddles, puzzles, and logic paradoxes at all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this effect must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed against this effect glean snippets of lore from this brush with the sphinx's mind, granting them a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks for 1 hour and the ability to attempt Knowledge checks with a DC higher than 10 untrained. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it can't be affected by the same elder sphinx's litany of riddles for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.  Sphinx Monolith (Su) An elder sphinx can enter a state of suspended animation and transform its massive body into a stone monument. This transformation takes 1 minute to complete, during which the elder sphinx is immobile. Once it transforms into its monolith form, the elder sphinx's body hardens to stone, granting it hardness 30 and 350 hit points. If the elder sphinx's stony body is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and the elder sphinx is slain. While transformed, an elder sphinx doesn't need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. The elder sphinx is aware of its surroundings and it can use astral projection at will when in this form. Anytime an elder sphinx's body takes damage while using astral projection, its astral form immediately becomes aware that it is in danger and can, as a free action, end the astral projection and begin reverting back to its natural form (though the process still takes 1 minute). When an elder sphinx ends its transformation, it is immediately healed of all hit point damage it may have sustained while transformed. An elder sphinx can remain in its sphinx monolith form indefinitely."}]

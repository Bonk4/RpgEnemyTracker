A moon spider's web attack is a ranged touch attack with a +6 racial bonus to the save DC needed to burst or escape the web. The spider also holds a trailing tether that prevents an entangled creature from moving away from the spider until it gets free.  Moon spiders frequently set web traps throughout areas where  they live. Anyone who enters a square of moon spider web must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 13) or become entangled as though it had been hit by a web attack (though the spider doesn't have a tether to it). If a creature that is already entangled enters a square of moon spider web, it must save again or become grappled. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A moon spider's webs have 10 hit points and DR 5/ slashing. A web that's set on fire takes an additional 1d6 points of fire damage each round until it's destroyed.

Chemical Burn (Su) Any creature struck by the caustic stalker, or that strikes it with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, is affected as if by the burn special attack, but takes acid damage instead of fire damage. The chemical burn persists for multiple rounds, just as a normal burn, but can be ended early if the affected creature is doused in at least 1 gallon of liquid (requiring a full-round action from the victim or another creature) or fully submerges itself in water. Misty Form (Su)A caustic stalker's body is composed of a semisolid chemical mist similar to thick foam. The caustic stalker does not have a Strength score and cannot manipulate or wear solid objects. This form grants it the amorphous defensive ability, and enables it to move through areas as small as 1 inch in diameter with no reduction to its speed. A caustic stalker cannot enter water or other fluids, and is treated as a creature two size categories smaller than its actual size (Tiny for most caustic stalkers) for the purposes of how wind affects it. Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)A caustic stalker takes damage every round that it's exposed to stronger than moderate winds: 1d6 points of damage for strong winds, 2d6 points of damage for severe winds, and an additional 1d6 points of damage for each wind force category beyond severe (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439).

Crystal Burst (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a xiomorn can create an explosion of razor-sharp crystals at a range of up to 120 feet. These crystals fill a 30-foot-radius burst and deal 12d6 points of piercing and slashing damage (Reflex DC 25 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Crystallization (Su) A creature struck by a xiomorn's claw must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Dexterity drain. On a critical hit, the claw deals 2 points of Dexterity drain on a failed save. As long as a creature suffers any of this drain, portions of its body appear as living green crystal and it gains the earth creature subtype. A creature drained to 0 Dexterity in this manner transforms into a green crystal statue, as if affected by flesh to stone. The save DC is Constitution-based.

For items made primarily of crystal, stone, or earth, this time and the item's cost to create are halved.  Secret of the Vault Seed (Su) Mythic xiomorns possess an innate understanding of Vault Seeds-the magic-rich artifacts that grow into the xiomorns' underground vaults. This process includes finding the raw crystals the seeds are formed from on the Plane of Earth, faceting the gem and using magic to grow it into its shape, and nurturing the seed with the proper spells once it's planted in the raw earth from which the Vault will grow.  A mythic xiomorn gains regeneration 10 while in a Vault it created or directly helped create. No attack form causes this regeneration to stop functioning; a mythic xiomorn can be killed by hit point damage only if removed from its Vault first.  Xiomorn Spellcasting (Su) This ability functions as simple arcane spellcasting, except that the xiomorn can change its spells each morning as though preparing spells, choosing a number of spells with a combined level equal to twice its CR. Each xiomorn knows a number of spells with a combined level equal to three times its CR-choosing from the spells listed above, as well as create demiplaneUM, mythic move earth, and terraformMA."}]

Acid Swimmer (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic nature of their environment on their home plane. Drench (Ex) The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller.

Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds."},{"Name":"Sprite","CR":"1.00","XP":"400","Size":"Small","Init":"4","AC":"16, touch 16, flat-footed 11","HP":"4","Fort":"1","Ref":"6","Will":"5","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., fly 50 ft.

Self-Repair (Ex) A clockwork parasite regains 1 hit point per round. Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects)."},{"Name":"Clubnek","CR":"2.00","XP":"600","Size":"Medium","Init":"1","AC":"14, touch 11, flat-footed 13","HP":"19","Fort":"4","Ref":"4","Will":"1","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"beak +5 (1d4+2), 2 claws +5 (1d4+2)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"","AbilitiyScores":"Str 14, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 10, Cha 6","BaseAtk":"3","CMB":"5","CMD":"16","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Burst of Speed (Ex) Once every 5 rounds, a clubnek can move five times its normal speed (200 feet) when it makes a charge."},{"Name":"Cooshee","CR":"2.00","XP":"600","Size":"Medium","Init":"3","AC":"16, touch 13, flat-footed 13","HP":"22","Fort":"5","Ref":"6","Will":"2","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.

Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half. Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals. Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals. Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice.

If it succeeds on a ranged touch attack, the mudman immediately makes a CMB check to grapple the target (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) with a +4 racial bonus. If the mudman fails to establish a hold, it drops into an adjacent square and is staggered for 1 round.  If the mudman establishes a hold, it flows over its opponent, covering the creature with its muddy body-it can attempt a new CMB check to maintain the \"hold\" on the creature each round that follows as a free action. The creature is effectively blinded and must either hold its breath or suffocate as long as the mudman retains its hold. Each round the mudman maintains its hold, it deals 1d4+3 points of damage as it crushes and constricts its victims.  Magic Vulnerability (Ex) Mudmen are particularly susceptible to dispel magic, as this spell disrupts the magical energies in their bodies. A mudman subjected to dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude save for half damage). Transmute mud to rock deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any mudmen caught in the area of effect and leaves them staggered until they can find a new mud pool. Other, similar spells may have similar effects.  Mud Bomb (Su) A mudman can hurl globs of its muddy body mixed with its surrounding mud-this attack has a range increment of 10 feet. If one of these mud bombs hits a target, it quickly grows semi-solid and tenacious, causing 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. If the cumulative Dexterity damage from mud bombs ever equals the target's actual Dexterity score, the target remains conscious but is held immobile and cannot take any physical action (although see below) until the mud is removed or the target breaks free. Spell-like abilities or spells with only verbal components may be used if the trapped creature can make a DC 20 concentration check. It's a DC 20 Strength check (made as a full-round action) to pry accumulated mud off and remove all Dexterity damage caused by the attack-a creature that is held immobile can break free with a DC 25 Strength check made as a full-round action (this is the only physical action the creature can attempt while encased in mud). The mud dries and crumbles to dust in 15 minutes, or in 1d3 rounds if a large amount of water (such as results from a casting of create water) is used to wash it away.  Mud Pool (Su) A mudman cannot leave the bounds of the mud pool it dwells in, although these mud pools may be of any size. A mudman's tremorsense extends throughout the entire mud pool, and it gains a +16 bonus on Stealth checks when hiding in a mud pool.

Natural Invisibility (Su) This ability is constant, allowing a poltergeist to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent, cannot be dispelled or negated, and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.  Rejuvenation (Su) Like ghosts, it's difficult to destroy a poltergeist through simple combat: the \"destroyed\" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Unlike ghosts, powerful spells such as dispel evil usually are effective. Short of that, however, the only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.  Telekinesis (Su) A poltergeist can create a telekinetic effect to hurl one object or creature within 10 feet to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). This ability functions as the violent thrust version of the telekinesis spell (caster level 10th) with the following exceptions: the poltergeist can hurl only one object or creature per round; the poltergeist uses its Charisma modifier (usually +2) to modify its base attack bonus. A creature targeted by this ability can make a DC 13 Will save to avoid being hurled by the poltergeist. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A DC 20 Heal check can be attempted to surgically extract an egg from a host.

An opponent hit by the cloud must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be entranced for 1d4 minutes (as by a charm monster spell). Entranced creatures can take no action other than to move at their normal speed into a space occupied by the yellow musk creeper. An entranced creature resists any attempt to halt its progress. A victim within a space occupied by the yellow musk creeper stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The save DC is Constitution-based. Rejuvenation (Ex) A yellow musk creeper can be killed only if its root is dug up, then burned, hacked apart, or otherwise destroyed. Reducing the creeper to 0 or less hit points puts it out of commission, allowing excavation of its roots. The main root is a Small object with a hardness of 3 and 10 hit points. The root can be affected by spells or effects that affect an area or targeted by spells that affect an individual target. As long as the root remains intact, a yellow musk creeper regrows in about 2 weeks."},{"Name":"Adherer","CR":"3.00","XP":"800","Size":"Medium","Init":"1","AC":"16, touch 11, flat-footed 15","HP":"26","Fort":"3","Ref":"2","Will":"4","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerability to fire","Speed":"30 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +6 (1d6+2 plus adhesive)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"adhesive","AbilitiyScores":"Str 14, Dex 12, Con 14, Int 4, Wis 11, Cha 11","BaseAtk":"3","CMB":"5","CMD":"16","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Adhesive (Ex) An adherer exudes a sour smelling glue-like substance that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items touching it, except for items made of stone.

If a brain gear controls multiple clockworks, it can instantaneously jump from clockwork to clockwork, keeping tabs on all of its thralls and perceiving the world through their senses. A brain gear can switch control from one clockwork to another once per round as a free action. A brain gear uses this ability to give commands to its clockworks, allowing the usually mindless creatures to fight with highly coordinated tactics.

Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds."},{"Name":"Mobat Bat","CR":"3.00","XP":"800","Size":"Large","Init":"5","AC":"15, touch 14, flat-footed 10","HP":"34","Fort":"7","Ref":"9","Will":"2","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"20 ft., fly 40 ft.

The oakman does not have to cast this spell to get the benefit; its effects are automatic as long as the club or staff is in the oakman's hands. (This benefit is already included in the statistics block above.) In anyone else's hands, the oaken club or staff functions as a normal weapon of whatever type it is. Moss (Ex) Using his unique knowledge of plants and herbal mixtures, an oakman can concoct unusual cakes from tree moss. A typical oakman has 1d6 moss cakes of random type on his person. These moss cakes have a variety of effects and must be eaten by the target creature to take effect. Saves (where applicable) have a DC of 15. Ability Score Damage: The victim suffers 1d6 points of ability damage to a random ability (determined when the moss cake is created). One day after eating the moss cake, if the victim doesn't receive a restoration spell, it must make another successful save or one point of the ability damage is actually drain. Coloration: This moss cake is quite harmless when eaten and does nothing more than cause the victim's skin to become spotted. The spots can be of just about any color, though most tend to be brown, red, or blue. The spots last for 1 hour before fading. Healing: This moss cake heals the target as by a heal spell cast by a 5th-level cleric. Lethargy: The victim falls into a state of apathy and becomes sluggish if it fails a Fortitude save. The effects last for 30 minutes. While affected, the victim moves at one-half its normal speed and suffers a -2 circumstance penalty to AC and on attack rolls, checks, and saves. Pain: Eating this moss cake wracks the victim with pain for 1d4 hours if it fails a Fortitude save. During this time, the victim suffers a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and ability and skill checks. Poison: Eating this moss cake poisons the victim (ingestion; save Fort DC 15; effect 1d6 Con, cure two consecutive saves). Sleep: This moss cake puts the victim to sleep for 1 hour (as the sleep spell) if it fails a Fortitude save. Tree Dependent (Su) An oakman is mystically bonded to a single, enormous tree and must never stray more than a mile from it. An oakman who moves more than a mile from his bonded tree immediately becomes sickened. Every hour thereafter, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour. An oakman that is out of range of his bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows-eventually, this separation kills the oakman. An oakman cannot forge a new bond with a new tree; if his tree is destroyed, he will eventually sicken and die. Tree Stride (Su) At will, an oakman can create an effect identical to that of the tree stride spell (caster level 5th). Oakmen can only travel through oak trees.

As a standard action, it can alter its form so as to appear as a floating, luminescent ball of light (possibly being mistaken for a will-o'-wisp in this form). In this form, it cannot use its Dexterity damage attack or its malevolence attack. It retains its incorporeal form and can make an incorporeal touch attack that deals normal damage (but not Dex damage).  A haunt remains in one form or the other until it chooses to assume a new one (as a standard action). A change in form cannot be dispelled. A haunt cannot change forms while using its malevolence attack (that is, while possessing a host).  Malevolence (Su) Once per round, a haunt can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane whose Dexterity has been reduced to 0 (either through the haunt's touch or by some other means). This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the haunt's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the haunt must be adjacent to the target.  The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 14 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same haunt's malevolence for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the haunt vanishes into the target's body (whose Dexterity temporarily returns to normal) and attempts to complete its unfinished task.  If the haunt completes its task, it leaves the host and fades away forever. When the haunt leaves the host, the host's Dexterity drops back to 0. If the host body is slain while the haunt is in possession of it, the creature becomes tied to that area and can never leave. Its unfinished task remains the same.  Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a haunt through simple combat: the \"destroyed\" spirit restores itself in 1d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a haunt is to use dispel evil/good/law/chaos (depending on the haunt's alignment) or determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.  Strangle (Su) If a creature possessed by a haunt has an alignment opposite to that of the haunt on either the law/ chaos or good/evil axis, it attempts to strangle the host using its own hands (i.e., the hands of the host body).  Unless precautions are taken to restrain the possessed victim's hands, they immediately reach for the throat and begin strangling the haunt-possessed body. An opponent takes 1d4 points of damage each round until its hands are forcibly restrained with a successful CMB check, the haunt is ejected from the body, or the victim dies.  Vulnerability (Ex) A haunt can be forcibly ejected from a host if hold person is cast on the victim and the haunt fails its Will save. A dispel evil/good/law/chaos spell (depending on the haunt's alignment) instantly ejects the creature from the host and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the haunt. A haunt slain in such a manner cannot rejuvenate and is permanently destroyed."},{"Name":"Hippopotamus","CR":"4.00","XP":"1200","Size":"Large","Init":"4","AC":"14, touch 9, flat-footed 14","HP":"51","Fort":"8","Ref":"5","Will":"3","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., swim 30 ft.","Melee":"bite +7 (2d8+6)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"capsize, trample (1d6+6, DC 17)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 19, Dex 10, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 4","BaseAtk":"4","CMB":"10","CMD":"20 (24 vs. trip)","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Capsize (Ex) A submerged hippo that surfaces under a boat less than its space can capsize it by making a CMB check.

The kelpie can automatically grapple a charmed foe and attempts to drown the victim. A charmed foe does not resist the kelpie's embrace, and the drowning attempt does not allow an additional save. Female creatures are immune to the kelpie's charm ability; only males can be affected.  The charm is negated if the victim dies, the kelpie dies, or dispel magic, greater dispelling, miracle, or wish is cast on the victim.

The second form is a hippocampus (see that entry). The third form is a Large green horse. In each form, the kelpie retains all of her special abilities. She does not truly alter her form (such as shapechangers do), she simply reshapes her body. In all of her forms, the kelpie's skin/fur has a greenish cast, and her features are slightly distorted.

Rend Armor (Ex) If a khargra hits with a bite attack, it deals normal bite damage and pulls apart any metal armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures wearing no armor or non-metal armor are unaffected by this special attack (though they still take normal bite damage).

Sundering Bite (Ex) A khargra can making a sunder attempt with its bite attack against an opponent's weapon or shield without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Note, against a khargra, a weapon or shield's hardness is only one-half as effective as normal. This means that a light steel shield, for example, is considered to have a hardness of 5 rather than 10 against a khargra's sunder attack. A weapon or shield reduced to 0 or less hit points is destroyed and half of it is swallowed by the khargra.  It only uses this special attack against metal weapons and shields. Damaged armor and weapons gain the broken condition.  Vulnerabilities (Ex) A khargra takes maximum damage from a heat metal spell (no save).

Mimic Shape (Ex) A mawler can assume the general shape of any object that is roughly Tiny sized. A mawler's body is fleshy and pliable, but it can alter the rigidity of its body to resemble metal, wood, and even stone. Most mawlers have found that taking on the shape of articles of clothing provides the most ready meals. The ruse can be detected by a Perception check opposed by the mawler's Disguise skill.  Vorpal Bite (Ex) A mawler that scores a critical hit with its bite attack while being worn severs the extremity that was inside it at the time.

The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Throes (Su) A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura). Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt.

The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each positive energy elemental's save DC.

Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the positive energy channeling ability of the positive energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other positive energy elementals. Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy, including inflict spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally.

A phantom stalker never uses this ability if it would harm the one that summoned it, unless the summoner itself is to blame for the phantom stalker's destruction (i.e., if the summoner attacks the stalker or orders it into battle against opponents that clearly outmatch it).  Find Target (Sp) If the one who summoned the phantom stalker is slain while the stalker is on the Material Plane, the stalker can unerringly find the slayer as though guided by discern location. Once the slayer has been tracked and dealt with, the phantom stalker returns to its home plane.  Flames of Healing (Ex) Any magical attack against a phantom stalker that deals fire damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the phantom stalker to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points."},{"Name":"Phycomid","CR":"4.00","XP":"1200","Size":"Small","Init":"0","AC":"15, touch 11, flat-footed 15","HP":"25","Fort":"5","Ref":"1","Will":"1","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"10 ft.","Melee":"","Ranged":"fluid globule ranged touch +4 (1d6 acid plus spore  infection)","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"0 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"acid, spore infection","AbilitiyScores":"Str 8, Dex 10, Con 13, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1","BaseAtk":"3","CMB":"1","CMD":"11 (can't be tripped)","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Acid (Ex) A phycomid's fluid globules are formed of acid.

A blood golem cannot gain more hit points than the maximum hit points allowed by its HD (not including any bonus hit points it may have from its Con score). For example, a 7-HD blood golem cannot gain more than 56 hit points. If a blood golem successfully hits an opponent with both of its slam attacks in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking 2d4 points of Constitution damage (DC 15 Fortitude save for half). A blood golem gains 5 hit points per point of Constitution damage it deals. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. When a blood golem reaches its maximum hit points for its Hit Dice, it divides (see cell division, below). Cell Division (Ex) When a blood golem absorbs enough blood to raise its hit points to the maximum for its HD, it splits into two identical blood golems, each with half the original's hit points. For example, a 7-HD blood golem that reaches 56 hit points splits into two 7-HD blood golems with 28 hit points each. Vulnerability to Magic (Ex) A blood golem is slowed (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds by any cold-based attacks or effects. A purify food and water spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a blood golem.

This is a standard action that deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round.  At Constitution 0, the host dies and the blood pudding feeds on the corpse. When sated, the pudding exits, and to onlookers it appears as if the slain creature is bleeding profusely.  Infuse (Ex) A blood pudding that makes a successful grapple check can forcibly merge its form with that of a living creature. If it succeeds, the blood pudding's form disappears as it soaks through skin, wounds, and any other opening in the host's body. This special attack deals no damage but allows the blood pudding to use its disgorge special attack (see above).  A creature infused with a blood pudding can try to forcibly eject the creature once per round as a standard action (coughing it up, vomiting, and so on). This requires a successful DC 17 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A creature can be affected by the pudding's infuse attack again, but gains a +2 conditional bonus on its Fortitude save. This bonus lasts for one day and is effective against the infuse attack of that blood pudding only.  Racial Vulnerabilities (Ex) Drinking alcohol weakens an infused pudding and reduces the Constitution damage sustained from its disgorge attack by one-half for the next 1d4+1 rounds.  Consuming pure vinegar causes an infused blood pudding to eject itself from the host in the same round the vinegar is consumed. A creature drinking pure vinegar must make a successful DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A blood pudding will not use its infuse attack against that host for one day.  A blood pudding hit with a cold effect or attack is slowed for 3 rounds (as the slow spell) and loses its racial bonus to grapple checks for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level.

It has one other form: that of a small, immature will-o'-wisp.  In humanoid form, a boggart assumes the same appearance and traits of its form, much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid form, a boggart retains all of its special attacks and special qualities.  The second form is that of a will-o- �wisp. In this form, a boggart is nearly indistinguishable from a normal will-o'- wisp, but a DC 18 Knowledge (dungeoneering) or Perception check reveals that the boggart is in fact smaller and brighter. A boggart can assume either form as a standard action, though it cannot maintain either one for longer than 1 minute (10 rounds). A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the boggart revert to its true natural form when slain.  A true seeing spell reveals the boggart's natural form if it is in will-o'-wisp form.  Confusion (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, a boggart can unleash a screech that confuses all those hearing it within 30 ft. of the boggart. The confusion lasts for 6 rounds. An affected creature can make a DC 15 Will save to negate the effects. Each additional boggart within 10 feet that joins the screeching increases the save DC by +1.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  Detect Thoughts (Su) A boggart can continuously detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 8th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.  Electricity (Su) A boggart delivers 2d6 points of electricity damage with a successful slam attack (DC 15 Fortitude for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Electrical Discharge (Su): Once every other round as a standard action, a boggart can discharge a bolt of electricity in a 10-foot line. The bolt deals 2d6 points of electricity damage (DC 15 Reflex save for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Feed (Su) When a boggart slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.  A boggart advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a boggart devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an aberration of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill ranks, feats, and ability score improvements normally.  The boggart only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A boggart that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a will-o'-wisp upon completion of the act.  Immunity to Magic (Ex) Boggarts are immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except magic missile, protection from evil, magic circle against evil, and maze."},{"Name":"Carrion Moth","CR":"5.00","XP":"1600","Size":"Large","Init":"4","AC":"20, touch 13, flat-footed 16","HP":"45","Fort":"4","Ref":"6","Will":"8","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"30 ft., climb 15 ft., fly 60 ft.

Good or neutral creatures are completely unaffected by the howl as long as they are not there to steal from the dead or attack the church. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same church grim's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Know Alignment (Su) A church grim makes automatically knows the alignment of any creature that enters its churchyard. This ability can be dispelled, but the church grim can reactivate it the following round as a free action.  It cannot extend this ability beyond the limits of its domain, however.  Limited Domain (Ex) The realm of a church grim encompasses only the churchyard it defends; it can wander freely in its cemetery and any adjoining church grounds, but it cannot move beyond; it must stop at the boundary of consecrated land.  Rejuvenation (Su) It is difficult to destroy a church grim through simple combat. A slain church grim restores itself within 24 hours. Even the most powerful spells are often only temporary solutions. A church grim that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its churchyard with a successful level check (1d20 + the church grim's HD) against DC 16.  The only sure way to get rid of a church grim is to raze the church it protects and cast unhallow on the churchyard.  Soul Defender (Su) It is the sacred duty of a church grim to defend the bodies and souls of those buried in its churchyard. Any attempts to cast an animate dead or similar spell to create undead within the confines of an area guarded by a church grim requires the caster to make a successful DC 20 caster level check. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Whether the check succeeds or not, the caster incurs the full wrath of the church grim immediately.

The target can resist the mental trespassing by succeeding on a DC 15 Will save. If the save fails, the fen witch has learned the creature's true name and can use her death speak ability. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or less and creatures with no Intelligence score are immune to this ability. Psionic creatures can use defense modes or other psionic abilities to counter this probe. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's mind probe for one day. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  Swamp Stride (Ex) A fen witch can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp.

Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds."},{"Name":"Large Stingray","CR":"5.00","XP":"1600","Size":"Large","Init":"0","AC":"14, touch 9, flat-footed 14","HP":"68","Fort":"9","Ref":"6","Will":"3","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"swim 30 ft.","Melee":"sting +11 (1d8+6 plus poison), wing +9 (1d6+3)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"poison","AbilitiyScores":"Str 22, Dex 11, Con 17, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2","BaseAtk":"6","CMB":"13","CMD":"23 (can't be tripped)","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str and paralysis 1d6+2 rds.; cure 1 save."},{"Name":"Magnesium Spirit","CR":"5.00","XP":"1600","Size":"Medium","Init":"6","AC":"14, touch 14, flat-footed 12","HP":"45","Fort":"8","Ref":"5","Will":"7","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"18","Weaknesses":"vulnerability to holy water","Speed":"50 ft.","Melee":"incorporeal tail slap +8 (1d6 plus 1d6 Str damage)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"blinding flash, energy drain, soul portal","AbilitiyScores":"Str -, Dex 15, Con 17, Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 15","BaseAtk":"6","CMB":"8","CMD":"20 (can't be tripped)","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Energy Drain (Su) A magnesium spirit possessing a host deals 1 negative level to it each round if the host fails a DC 16 Will save.

A magnesium spirit can be damaged by holy water even while merged with its host. Holy water deals 2d4 points of damage per vial to the creature.

They also receive -2 hp per HD, and a -2 penalty to the Will save DC of their spectral strangulation ability. Spawn are under the command of the apparition that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed apparitions.

Spectral Strangulation (Su) An apparition attacks an opponent by implanting a suggestion in the victim's mind, convincing it that it is being strangled by the apparition's bony claws. The apparition must be on the same plane as the target creature to use this ability.  The target of the spectral strangulation feels the bony, claw-like fingers of the apparition at its throat-even through armor.

On a failed save, the victim must immediately succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or die from fright due to heart failure.

Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds."},{"Name":"Huge Monstrous Sea Wasp","CR":"7.00","XP":"3200","Size":"Huge","Init":"1","AC":"13, touch 9, flat-footed 12","HP":"52","Fort":"8","Ref":"3","Will":"2","DefensiveAbilities":"transparent","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"swim 60 ft.","Melee":"tentacle +7 (2d6+4 plus poison)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"entangle","AbilitiyScores":"Str 17, Dex 13, Con 14, Int -, Wis 10, Cha 2","BaseAtk":"6","CMB":"11","CMD":"22 (can't be tripped)","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Entangle (Ex) A sea wasp can entangle a creature up to two sizes smaller than itself with its tentacles with a successful CMB check.

This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Cocoon (Ex) Once per round as a standard action, and no more than three times per day, a cerebral stalker can cocoon a grappled foe by shooting sticky webbing from its body. The webs cover as much of the victim as possible, excluding the top of the victim's head, its eyes, and its nose. The webs remain attached to the cerebral stalker's body and stretch from just under its arms to its knees. A cocooned victim is anchored to the cerebral stalker and cannot move. The cocooned creature can, as a standard action, break free with a successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check. The webbing has 8 hit points. Note the victim is still grappled even if it breaks the webbing and must succeed at a grapple check to get completely free of the cerebral stalker's grasp. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus. Once a victim is cocooned, the cerebral stalker can use its sink ability.  Consume Brain (Ex) Once it has its victim underground, the cerebral stalker begins gnawing on the victim's head, rapidly chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 2d8+4 points of damage each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker has reached its goal-the victim's brain, which it promptly devours. A victim slain in this manner is ejected from the ground and becomes a zombie (see below).  Create Zombie (Su): A creature whose brain is devoured by a cerebral stalker is ejected from the ground and animates as a zombie in 1d4 rounds. Zombies created in this manner are not under the control of the cerebral stalker.

Its gliding leaves no sign of its passage or hint of its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense. A move earth spell cast on an area.  Sink (Su) After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker begins sinking into the ground, taking the cocooned victim with it. It takes four full rounds for the stalker and foe to completely sink into the ground. In the first round, the creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist; in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both stalker and foe are completely underground.  opportunity.  Creatures attempting to grab the cocooned victim and prevent the sinking must first break or burn the webbing (see above), and then succeed at a grapple check against the cerebral stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold monster spell) for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker fails a Fortitude save. The stalker can make a new save each round to negate the paralysis. The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the victim is placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis).  The spot where the cerebral stalker and victim sunk radiates magic and can be detected normally. Spells such as locate object, discern location, scrying, and other divinatory magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A freedom spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects both it and the stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the surface."},{"Name":"Common Time Elemental","CR":"8.00","XP":"4800","Size":"Medium","Init":"9","AC":"21, touch 18, flat-footed 15","HP":"102","Fort":"7","Ref":"13","Will":"10","DefensiveAbilities":"foresight","SR":"19","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"fly 20 ft.

If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack. An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age. A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger). Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day. Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell. Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common). Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spell-like abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time. Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all. Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell. Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day. Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based. Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD)."},{"Name":"Dust Ghoul","CR":"8.00","XP":"4800","Size":"Medium","Init":"7","AC":"21, touch 13, flat-footed 18","HP":"102","Fort":"9","Ref":"9","Will":"6","DefensiveAbilities":"channel resistance +4","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft., fly 40 ft.

This poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves more than 5 ft. away from the acid quasi-elemental. Vulnerability to Water (Ex) An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by water. An acid quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasi-elemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental."},{"Name":"Elder Obsidian Quasi-elemental","CR":"9.00","XP":"6400","Size":"Huge","Init":"-1","AC":"21, touch 7, flat-footed 21","HP":"114","Fort":"8","Ref":"7","Will":"8","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"20 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +20 (2d6+10/19-20)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"death throes, molten glass (2d8 fire, DC 20)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 30, Dex 8, Con 19, Int 6, Wis 11, Cha 11","BaseAtk":"12","CMB":"24","CMD":"31","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Death Throes (Ex) When reduced to 0 or less hit points, an obsidian quasi-elemental explodes in a cloud of razor-sharp bits of obsidian.

Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds."},{"Name":"Iron Maiden Golem","CR":"9.00","XP":"6400","Size":"Large","Init":"0","AC":"25, touch 9, flat-footed 25","HP":"96","Fort":"4","Ref":"4","Will":"4","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerability to rust","Speed":"20 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +19 (2d10+8 plus grab)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"animated host, bladed lid, steal essence","AbilitiyScores":"Str 27, Dex 10, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1","BaseAtk":"12","CMB":"+21 (+25 grapple)","CMD":"31","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Animated Host (Su) Once a victim trapped within an iron maiden has died, it reanimates as a zombie in the next round (as if by an animate dead spell). It cannot escape, however, and serves only to fuel the iron maiden and provide it with skills and abilities. While it is trapped, the zombie cannot be attacked, damaged, turned, rebuked, or commanded, and it doesn't suffer any damage from the bladed lid. If the lid of the golem is somehow forced open, the zombie has the normal abilities of a Medium zombie (as detailed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). The victim of an iron maiden golem must be alive when it is placed inside and the lid is closed or the golem's animate host ability fails. Bladed Lid (Ex) A living creature inside an iron maiden when the lid is closed is pierced by twenty dagger-like blades, dealing a total of 50 points of piercing damage each round. The lid automatically seals with an arcane lock spell with a caster level equal to that of the iron maiden golem's creator (14th level usually). The lid can be forced open with a successful Strength check (DC 34) or by casting dispel magic. The knock spell has no effect on the lid. The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +10 bonus from the arcane lock spell. Because of the shape of the iron maiden, only a Medium humanoid can be sealed inside. Immunity to Magic (Ex) An iron maiden golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron maiden golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the iron maiden golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. Steal Essence (Su) An iron maiden golem that has created a host using its animate host ability (see above) gains 10 temporary hit points, uses its own base attack bonus or the host's (whichever is higher), and can make normal use of the victim's skills, feats, and non-magical class abilities. The golem must substitute its own ability scores when determining its total skill bonuses; therefore it cannot use skills requiring Constitution or Intelligence, and since it cannot speak, many Charisma skills are severely limited. Likewise, the iron maiden golem must meet the requirements for any feat in order to make use of that feat (thus feats such as Dodge and Combat Expertise are unavailable to the golem). An iron maiden cannot use any divine spells or divinely granted special abilities, since the host within is no longer able to receive such abilities from her deity. An iron maiden likewise cannot use any arcane spells as its inherent magic immunity disrupts any attempt to do so.

Metallic creatures or creatures using metal weapons take an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. Globe (Ex) As a standard action, a lightning quasi-elemental can discharge one globe of electricity per HD it possesses once per round. Globes hover by the quasi-elemental and move with the creature.

Cast: A lich shade can cast the spell on his turn at caster level 11th. When casting spells in this manner, he ignores the spell's material component requirements, but not its focus requirements.  Eldritch Bolt: A lich shade can release the spell as an eldritch bolt of pure magic energy as a standard action (range 50 ft., ranged touch +12, 1d6 damage per 2 levels of the spell used to create it).

A target unwilling to return to life can prevent its raising by making an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone fairy's Charisma check. If the tombstone fairy wins the check, the target's soul is forced into its body and it returns to life. If the target wins the opposed check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone fairy cannot attempt to raise that same target for one month.  During the ritual a portion of the target's soul transfers to its funeral shroud or cloth. The tombstone fairy often retains this shroud so as to force compliance from the returned target.  Once the target does what the fairy desires, the tombstone fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the target's soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a resurrection, true resurrection, miracle or wish.

Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to that red jester's fear cackle for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. Jester's Deck (Su) The red jester uses a deck of playing cards in combat that functions as a deck of many things (Pathfinder RPG core rulebook, 544-555). Once per round, as a standard action, the red jester can draw a single card and throw it at an opponent to a range of 20 feet. This requires a successful ranged touch attack.

It does so as a free action. Creatures attacking a scylla unarmed or with natural weapons take 1d6 points of fire damage each time their attacks hit. In addition, a scylla can use its heat ability to boil the surrounding waters. Scalding Blast (Ex) A scylla can gulp some of the boiling water surrounding it as a move action.

The scylla can target the same or different opponents with each head, if it wishes. Each blast deals 3d6 points of fire damage or half that amount if the target succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save.

Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random plane. Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based. Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body. Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass. Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds."},{"Name":"Flayer Devil","CR":"11.00","XP":"12800","Size":"Large","Init":"2","AC":"27, touch 11, flat-footed 25","HP":"174","Fort":"13","Ref":"10","Will":"10","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"22","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"2 claws +21 (1d8+9/19-20), bite +21 (2d6+9)","Ranged":"","Space":"10 ft.","Reach":"10 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"flensing, unholy burst","AbilitiyScores":"Str 29, Dex 15, Con 29, Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 14","BaseAtk":"12","CMB":"22","CMD":"34","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Unholy Burst (Su) Three times per day, a flayer devil can release a burst of hellish black vapor in a 30-foot radius.

This ability can be negated, but the time flayer can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time flayers are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Reality Bend (Su) As a free action, a time flayer can fold the dimensional space surrounding it so its true location is hard to discern. Attackers have a 50% miss chance each time they attack with melee or ranged weapons. This is similar to the miss chance granted by a displacement spell. See invisibility does not reveal the creature's location, but true seeing does. Temporal Displacement (Su) As a melee touch attack, a time flayer can send a creature a few seconds into the future. A DC 18 Fortitude save negates. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. This effectively removes that creature from combat for the duration. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it suffers no damage and is shunted aside. The time flayer can use this ability three times per day. Time Jaunt (Su) As a standard action, a time flayer can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time flayer and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius that the time flayer designates. Unwilling creatures can attempt a DC 18 Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the greater teleport spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Past events the creature was responsible for are now attributed to an unknown-even if they recently took place. For example, suppose a great hero saved a kingdom from certain doom and then suffers the unmaking. The kingdom is still safe, but no one can quite recall who saved it. A creature that suffers the unmaking cannot be raised, resurrected, or restored to life by any means-not even a wish can restore an unmade creature.

It can pass through holes and small openings-even cracks. It can also occupy spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a gaseous form spell-note the air elemental construct is not subject to wind effects like the gaseous form spell.)

Magic Weapon (Ex) A reliquary guardian carries a +1 greatsword with an alignment special quality that matches its alignment on the good-evil axis or the law-chaos axis.  Thus, a chaotic evil reliquary guardian might carry a +1 anarchic greatsword or a +1 unholy greatsword while a lawful good reliquary guardian would carry either a +1 axiomatic greatsword or a +1 holy greatsword.  Pronouncement (Su) Once per day, a reliquary guardian can make a pronouncement that affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. This pronouncement otherwise functions as a blasphemy, dictum, holy word, or word of chaos spell. Note: a reliquary guardian only has one type of pronouncement. It is set during the construction process based on the creator's alignment and the reliquary guardian's alignment and cannot be changed.  The Will save, where applicable, has a DC of 21. The save DC is Wisdom-based.  Blasphemy: CE, LE, or NE reliquary guardians.  Dictum: LG, LE, or LN reliquary guardians.  Holy Word: CG, LG, or NG reliquary guardians.  Word of Chaos: CE, CG, or CN reliquary guardians.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A reliquary guardian has a total of five spell-like abilities (one each of spell levels 1st thru 5th), each usable once per day. Its spell-like abilities are based on its alignment and are drawn from one of the following cleric domains: Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law. A reliquary guardian whose alignment is CE, CG, LG, or LE must be assigned a single domain (one that matches one of its alignment axes) during construction. This domain can never be changed.  Regardless of the reliquary guardian's alignment, its spell-like abilities function at caster level 16th. The save DCs are Wisdom-based."},{"Name":"Slime Demodand","CR":"13.00","XP":"25600","Size":"Medium","Init":"4","AC":"28, touch 14, flat-footed 24","HP":"136","Fort":"13","Ref":"8","Will":"10","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"24","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft., fly 50 ft.

Engulf (Ex) A water elemental construct can simply engulf Large or smaller creatures in its path as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The water elemental construct merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the construct, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 36 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed- on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the construct moves forward.

A horrid wilting spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to a water elemental construct. The elemental construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 18 + caster's relevant ability modifier) for half damage. A create water spell heals 1d4 points of damage on the construct for each 2 gallons of water created.

This requires the widow creeper to succeed on a ranged touch attack with a +11 bonus to hit. A creature hit by the vines is entangled. An entangled creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a full-round action to make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based.

In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw. A power word kill spell cast by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the demi-lich if it fails a Fortitude save (DC 19 + caster's relevant ability score modifier). Note: power word kill does not normally allow a save.) A holy smite spell affects the demi-lich normally. A dispel evil spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw. Rejuvenation (Su) Unless holy water is poured over the destroyed remains of a demi-lich, the creature reforms in 1d10 days with a successful level check (1d20 + demi-lich's HD) against DC 16. Trap the Soul (Su) A demi-lich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw. If the target makes its saving throw, it gains three negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demi-lich's mouth. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demi-lich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at the end of that time the sou l is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demi-lich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of resurrection, true resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim protected by a death ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude save and is effective against the level loss on a successful save. The save DC is Charisma-based. Unholy Grace (Su) A demi-lich adds its Charisma modifier as a bonus on its saving throws and as a profane bonus to its Armor Class. Vorpal Susceptibility (Su) Vorpal weapons, no matter their enhancement bonus, ignore a demi-lich's DR but do only half damage to a demi-lich (demi-liches cannot be beheaded)."},{"Name":"Furnace Golem","CR":"14.00","XP":"38400","Size":"Huge","Init":"-1","AC":"29, touch 7, flat-footed 29","HP":"144","Fort":"6","Ref":"5","Will":"6","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"20 ft.","Melee":"2 slams +28 (4d6+11 plus 2d6 fire plus grab)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"breath weapon (50-ft. line, 10d6 fire, Reflex DC 19 half, every 1d4 rounds), furnace-interior, heat","AbilitiyScores":"Str 32, Dex 9, Con -, Int -, Wis 11, Cha 1","BaseAtk":"19","CMB":"+32 (+36 grapple)","CMD":"41","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Furnace-Interior (Ex) A furnace golem can try to shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes smaller than itself into its interior by making a successful grapple check.

If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack. An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age. A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger). Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day. Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell. Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common). Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spell-like abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time. Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all. Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell. Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day. Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based. Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD)."},{"Name":"Sand Giant","CR":"14.00","XP":"38400","Size":"Huge","Init":"1","AC":"24, touch 9, flat-footed 23","HP":"218","Fort":"17","Ref":"7","Will":"9","DefensiveAbilities":"rock catching","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"greatsword +24/+19/+14 (4d6+16) or 2 slams +23 (2d6+11)","Ranged":"rock +14 (2d6+16)","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"fist of sand (slam +26, 1d8+10 damage; DC 29; CMB +26, CMD 36; AC 20, touch 8, flat-footed 20; hp 69; 19 rounds), rock throwing (120 ft.)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 33, Dex 13, Con 23, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 14","BaseAtk":"14","CMB":"+27 (+29 bull rush)","CMD":"38 (40 vs. bull rush)","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Fist of Sand (Su) Once per day as a move action, a sand giant can form a volume of sand within 40 feet into the shape of a 20-foot long arm that ends in a clenched fist.

It can do this a total of twelve times per day (so it could inject one tentacle twelve times into any plane, or four tentacles up to three times each).  All of its tentacles must be injected into the same plane, and all appear within the same 20-foot area. While using this abitliy, it uses sensory organs on its tentacles to see, hear, smell, and efel its surroundings. It can attack normally (at its full attack bonus) while using this ability but it cannot move from its current location. It can withdraw its tentacles as a move action and re-inject them into the same plane (or a different plane) on its next turn.  A dismissal, dispel chaos, or dispel evil spell (using the second effect of either spell) causes an abyssal harvester to withdraw a single tentacle (whichever one was touched) if it fails its Wli lsave.  It cannot re-inject that same tentacle into the same plane for one day.  A banishment spell forces an abyssal harvester to withdraw all of its tentacles if it fails its Will save. It cannot re-inject any ten-tacles that were banished into the same plane for one day.  Harvest (Su): This ability can only be used when the abyssal harvester is on its abyssal plane and injects its tentacles into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, a material plane, or the Nine Hells.  A grappled foe with 20 or fewer hit points or 4 or fewer Constitution points must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be drawn through an invisible planar gate (created around the abyssal harvester's tentacles) onto the same plane where the abyssal harvester currently resides. An opponent drawn into the same plane with the harvester is still grappled upon arrival. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Tentacle Regeneration (Ex): An abyssal harvester regrows any lost tentacles in 1 week."},{"Name":"Afanc","CR":"17.00","XP":"102400","Size":"Colossal","Init":"1","AC":"23, touch 3, flat-footed 22","HP":"333","Fort":"22","Ref":"14","Will":"11","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"28","Weaknesses":"water-dependant","Speed":"5 ft., swim 60 ft.","Melee":"bite +32 (5d6+16), 2 claws +31 (2d8+16)","Ranged":"","Space":"100 ft.","Reach":"20 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"sea swell, swallow whole (4d6+16 plus 8 points acid damage, AC 20, 33 hp)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 42, Dex 13, Con 28, Int 3, Wis 15, Cha 10","BaseAtk":"23","CMB":"+47 (+51 grapple, sunder)","CMD":"+58 (can't be tripped)","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Sea Swell (Ex): As a full-round action, an afanc can raise the front part of its body out of the water and bring it crashing back down against the surface.

If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack. An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age. A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger). Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day. Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell. Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn. Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common). Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spell-like abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time. Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all. Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell. Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day. Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based. Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD)."},{"Name":"Choronzon Demon","CR":"18.00","XP":"153600","Size":"Huge","Init":"6","AC":"32, touch 10, flat-footed 30","HP":"290","Fort":"23","Ref":"14","Will":"10","DefensiveAbilities":"","SR":"29","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"bite +30 (2d8+11/19-20), 2 claws +29 (1d8+11 plus daze)","Ranged":"","Space":"15 ft.","Reach":"15 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"breath weapon (40-ft. cone, 10d6 damage, Fort DC 29 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), daze (claw attack, Fort DC 31 negates, dazed 1d3 rounds)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 33, Dex 15, Con 29, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 18","BaseAtk":"20","CMB":"33","CMD":"45","Source":"Tome of Horrors Complete","SpecialAbilities":"Aura of Confusion (Su) A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by that choronzon's aura of confusion for one day.

Spawn are under the command of the mortuary cyclone that created them and remain enslaved until its destruction. See the sidebar for the type of undead creatures a mortuary cyclone can spawn.  Desecrating Aura (Su) A mortuary cyclone emanates an aura of desecration within a 50-foot radius centered on its body.  This functions as a desecrate spell (caster level 18th) as if the mortuary cyclone where a permanent fixture dedicated to its own deity. Clerics in the area take a -6 profane penalty on turning checks, undead within the area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves, and undead created within the area have +2 hit points per HD.

The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 40 and can result in actual level loss on a failed save. The negative levels cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the rod is wielded. Any goodaligned creature that touches the rod takes 3d6 points of Constitution drain each round it touches the rod (DC 40 Fortitude save for half). Hell's Redoubt: Hell's Redoubt is Lucifer's Large suit of +5 heavy fortification banded mail that has no armor check penalty, speed penalty, and no chance for arcane spell failure. It was personally crafted for him the hands of Cheshimiboth, Armorer of the Nine Hells, just prior to the Great Uprising. To reward this unique devil's genius for crafting, Lucifer had him murdered in the first moments of the Uprising to prevent him from ever revealing any vulnerability in the armor he fashioned or ever again crafting its equal. In addition to its fortification qualities, three times per day, Lucifer can cause the fires of Hell to spring forth stationary once called forth). These fires last for 3 rounds and deal 10d6 points of fire damage per round (DC 40 Reflex save for half) and ignore all fire resistance and fire immunity. Only the wearer of the armor is immune to their effects. Those slain by these fires are completely destroyed (including their equipment) and cannot be returned to life through anything short of divine intervention. Hell's Redoubt functions as +1 banded mail and bestows five negative levels for as long as it is worn if worn by anyone other than Lucifer unless the wearer defeats Asmodeus and gains the Throne of Hell. At that point it resumes its ordinary function. Anyone wearing the armor is filled with the overwhelming urge to attempt to do that very thing no matter the cost. The negative levels disappear if the armor is removed."}]

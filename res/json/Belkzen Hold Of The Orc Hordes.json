The save DC is Constitution-based.  Ankhravs, also called \"ankheg queens,\" are fearsome predators most common near the Skittermounds. These six-legged beasts are larger than regular ankhegs, but the most telling difference between them and drones is the pair of razor-sharp, mantislike arms located at the front of the thorax. While these arms provide no locomotive aid- their scissorlike edges are too delicate to support any weight-these additional appendages allow ankhravs to quickly bring down prey that would take ankheg spawn much longer to swarm and slay. Ankhravs are rarely encountered alone, and then only when a young queen travels from her home nest to establish a new colony. In most cases, when they venture from their lairs, ankhravs hunt accompanied by ankheg drones."},{"Name":"Burning Child","CR":"10.00","XP":"9600","Size":"Small","Init":"7","AC":"17, touch 15, flat-footed 13","HP":"150","Fort":"9","Ref":"12","Will":"11","DefensiveAbilities":"channel resistance +4, final embrace","SR":"","Weaknesses":"vulnerable to cold","Speed":"40 ft.","Melee":"slam +10 (1d4-2 plus burn)","Ranged":"","Space":"5 ft.","Reach":"5 ft.","SpecialAttacks":"breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 10d6 fire damage, Reflex DC 21 half), burn (2d8, DC 21)","AbilitiyScores":"Str 6, Dex 17, Con -, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 18","BaseAtk":"7","CMB":"14","CMD":"17","Source":"Belkzen Hold Of The Orc Hordes","SpecialAbilities":"Binary State (Su) Most of the time the Burning Child is in a passive state, during which he's incorporeal and invisible, though his soft sobs and the scent of burning flesh allow a creature to pinpoint his location with a successful DC 30 Perception check.

While active, the Burning Child is corporeal and visible. After 1d4 hours without being attacked or seeing conflict, the Burning Child reenters his passive state.  Breath Weapon (Su) The Burning Child can use his breath weapon only when in his active state, and only once each time he becomes active.

Any living victims that are swallowed whole and killed while within the Juggerloathe are turned into twisted creatures of undeath and pain. Regardless of their original size or form, those killed within the Juggerloathe become bodaks (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 48), though their appearance may be less humanoid than those of typical bodaks. These undead stop taking damage while within the Juggerloathe, and escape its innards when it next uses its ejection attack. The undead aren't controlled by the Juggerloathe, but they don't attack it and it is immune to their powers.  Ejection (Ex) The Juggerloathe can eject the contents of its stomach in a 60-foot cone that deals 8d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 27 half) once every 1d6 rounds. Any creatures swallowed whole by it-still living and undead-land prone at the far end of the cone. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Leaping Shockwave (Ex) The Juggerloathe leaps into combat much like normal bulettes, but lands with an earth-shaking impact. When it charges, it can attempt a DC 25 Acrobatics check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it's successful, all adjacent foes must succeed at a DC 30 Reflex save or be knocked prone. The Juggerloathe ends its charge with two bite attacks and two claw attacks, dividing them up as it sees fit among targets within reach. The save DC is Strength-based."}]

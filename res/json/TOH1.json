It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter, it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights using the stats below. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the algoid that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. This ability is otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 10th). Mind Blast (Sp) Once per day, an algoid can use a mind blast in a 60-foot cone. Any creature caught in the cone must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Stun (Ex) If an algoid scores a critical hit with a slam attack, the opponent struck must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based. Vulnerability to Water (Ex)  A control water spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to an algoid (no save)."},{"Name":"Aerial Servant","CR":"11.00","XP":"12800","Size":"Medium","Init":"9","AC":"19, touch 15, flat-footed 14","HP":"152","Fort":"11","Ref":"17","Will":"10","DefensiveAbilities":"elemental traits, natural invisibility, link with caster","SR":"","Weaknesses":"","Speed":"fly 60 ft.

Should the aerial servant fail the mission it has been assigned, it returns to the caster and attacks him. The aerial servant can find the caster as long as he is on the same plane of existence. If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster returns or the aerial servant enters the plane the caster is on, the link is immediately reconnected and the aerial servant moves at the full speed toward the casters current location. Only when the aerial servant or caster is destroyed is the link permanently broken. Natural Invisibility (Su)  This ability is constant, allowing the aerial servant to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and is not subject to the invisibility purge  spell. This ability does not function on the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but instead grants the creature concealment (20% miss) chance. Wind Blast (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, an aerial servant can release a blast of wind in an 80-foot line. A creature struck takes 4d8 points of damage, and creatures up to the aerial servant's size or smaller are knocked knocked back 2d10 feet and prone.  An affected creature can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save to reduce the damage by half and avoid being knocked down.  The save DC is Constitution-based."}]
